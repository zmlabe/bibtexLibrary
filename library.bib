abstract = {This study provides an overview of projected changes in climate extremes indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The temperature- and precipitation-based indices are computed with a consistent methodology for climate change simulations using different emission scenarios in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) and Phase 5 (CMIP5) multimodel ensembles. We analyze changes in the indices on global and regional scales over the 21st century relative to the reference period 1981–2000. In general, changes in indices based on daily minimum temperatures are found to be more pronounced than in indices based on daily maximum temperatures. Extreme precipitation generally increases faster than total wet-day precipitation. In regions, such as Australia, Central America, South Africa, and the Mediterranean, increases in consecutive dry days coincide with decreases in heavy precipitation days and maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation, which indicates future intensification of dry conditions. Particularly for the precipitation-based indices, there can be a wide disagreement about the sign of change between the models in some regions. Changes in temperature and precipitation indices are most pronounced under RCP8.5, with projected changes exceeding those discussed in previous studies based on SRES scenarios. The complete set of indices is made available via the ETCCDI indices archive to encourage further studies on the various aspects of changes in extremes.},

abstract = {The fourth version of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) was recently completed and re- leased to the climate community. This paper describes developments to all CCSM components, and docu- ments fully coupled preindustrial control runs compared to the previous version, CCSM3. Using the standard atmosphere and land resolution of 18 results in the sea surface temperature biases in the major upwelling regions being comparable to the 1.48-resolution CCSM3. Two changes to the deep convection scheme in the atmosphere component result in CCSM4 producing El Nin˜o–Southern Oscillation variability with a much more realistic frequency distribution than in CCSM3, although the amplitude is too large compared to ob- servations. These changes also improve the Madden–Julian oscillation and the frequency distribution of tropical precipitation. A new overflow parameterization in the ocean component leads to an improved sim- ulation of the Gulf Stream path and the North Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation. Changes to the CCSM4 land component lead to a much improved annual cycle of water storage, especially in the tropics. The CCSM4 sea ice component uses much more realistic albedos than CCSM3, and for several reasons the Arctic sea ice concentration is improved in CCSM4. An ensemble of twentieth-century simulations produces a good match to the observed September Arctic sea ice extent from 1979 to 2005. TheCCSM4ensemble mean increase in globally averaged surface temperature between 1850 and 2005 is larger than the observed increase by about 0.48C. This is consistent with the fact that CCSM4 does not include a representation of the indirect effects of aerosols, although other factors may come into play. The CCSM4 still has significant biases, such as the mean precipitation distribution in the tropical Pacific Ocean, too much low cloud in the Arctic, and the latitudinal distributions of shortwave and longwave cloud forcings.},

abstract = {The continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide due to anthropogenic emissions is predicted to lead to significant changes in climate. About half of the current emissions are being absorbed by the ocean and by land ecosystems, but this absorption is sensitive to climate as well as to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, creating a feedback loop. General circulation models have generally excluded the feedback between climate and the biosphere, using static vegetation distributions and CO2 concentrations from simple carbon-cycle models that do not include climate change. Here we present results from a fully coupled, three-dimensional carbon-climate model, indicating that carbon-cycle feedbacks could significantly accelerate climate change over the twenty-first century. We find that under a 'business as usual' scenario, the terrestrial biosphere acts as an overall carbon sink until about 2050, but turns into a source thereafter. By 2100, the ocean uptake rate of 5 Gt C yr(-1) is balanced by the terrestrial carbon source, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are 250 p.p.m.v. higher in our fully coupled simulation than in uncoupled carbon models, resulting in a global-mean warming of 5.5 K, as compared to 4 K without the carbon-cycle feedback.},

abstract = {Global mean temperature is predicted to increase by 2–7 °C and precipitation to change across the globe by the end of this century. To quantify climate effects on ecosystem processes, a number of climate change experiments have been established around the world in various ecosystems. Despite these efforts, general responses of terrestrial ecosystems to changes in temperature and precipitation, and especially to their combined effects, remain unclear. We used meta-analysis to synthesize ecosystem-level responses to warming, altered precipitation, and their combination. We focused on plant growth and ecosystem carbon (C) balance, including biomass, net primary production (NPP), respiration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and ecosystem photosynthesis, synthesizing results from 85 studies. We found that experimental warming and increased precipitation generally stimulated plant growth and ecosystem C fluxes, whereas decreased precipitation had the opposite effects. For example, warming significantly stimulated total NPP, increased ecosystem photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration. Experimentally reduced precipitation suppressed aboveground NPP (ANPP) and NEE, whereas supplemental precipitation enhanced ANPP and NEE. Plant productivity and ecosystem C fluxes generally showed higher sensitivities to increased precipitation than to decreased precipitation. Interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation tended to be smaller than expected from additive, single-factor effects, though low statistical power limits the strength of these conclusions. New experiments with combined temperature and precipitation manipulations are needed to conclusively determine the importance of temperature–precipitation interactions on the C balance of terrestrial ecosystems under future climate conditions.},

In both scenarios, the results indicate reduction of tropical forest cover areas which would be replaced by savannas. This reduction of tropical forests increases with the time through the end of the 21st century, mostly over southeastern Amazonia. Considering the biome changes from current potential vegetation in the case when at least 75{\%} of the calculations agree on the projected biome change ( consensus), the decrease of the tropical forest area in South America is 3{\%} for the period 2020 - 2029, 9{\%} for 2050 - 2059 and 18{\%} for 2090 - 2099 for the A2 emission scenario.},

The character of liquid precipitation (defined as a combination of accumulation, frequency, and intensity) over the global oceans is significantly different from the character of liquid precipitation produced by global weather and climate models. Five different models are used in this comparison representing state-of-the-art weather prediction models, state-of-the-art climate models, and the emerging high-resolution global cloud "resolving" models. The differences between observed and modeled precipitation are larger than can be explained by observational retrieval errors or by the inherent sampling differences between observations and models. We show that the time integrated accumulations of precipitation produced by models closely match observations when globally composited. However, these models produce precipitation approximately twice as often as that observed and make rainfall far too lightly. This finding reinforces similar findings from other studies based on surface accumulated rainfall measurements. The implications of this dreary state of model depiction of the real world are discussed.},

abstract = {We have observed that the dry-season length (DSL) has increased over southern Amazonia since 1979, primarily owing to a delay of its ending dates (dry-season end, DSE), and is accompanied by a prolonged fire season. A poleward shift of the subtropical jet over South America and an increase of local convective inhibition energy in austral winter (June–August) seem to cause the delay of the DSE in austral spring (September–November). These changes cannot be simply linked to the variability of the tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Although they show some resemblance to the effects of anthropogenic forcings reported in the literature, we cannot attribute them to this cause because of inadequate representation of these processes in the global climate models that were presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report. These models significantly underestimate the variability of the DSE and DSL and their controlling processes. Such biases imply that the future change of the DSE and DSL may be underestimated by the climate projections provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report models. Although it is not clear whether the observed increase of the DSL will continue in the future, were it to continue at half the rate of that observed, the long DSL and fire season that contributed to the 2005 drought would become the new norm by the late 21st century. The large uncertainty shown in this study highlights the need for a focused effort to better understand and simulate these changes over southern Amazonia.},

The authors conclude that the DSL has lengtheend since 1979 due to delayed DSE. Primary factors driving this delay include "a poleward shift of the subtropical jet over South America and an increase of local convective inhibition energy in austral winter". The study also notes that CMIP5 models seem to underestimate these changes and therefore may also underestimate future changes. 

"Fifteen percent of global photosynthesis occurs in the Amazon rainforest, where 25{\%} of plant species are found." --{\textgreater} Good motivation. 
Extreme droughts in the Amazon have already occurred in 2005 and 2010. During the 2005 drought, the rainforest "released more than 1 Pg of C to the atmosphere". The rainforest was slow to revoer after this event. 
The DSL has increased att a rate of about 6.5 +/- 2.5 days per decade. 
The fire season in the southern Amazonia is from Aug-Oct, around the time the dry season ends. Delaying the DSE can lead to a lengthened fire season. 
"The observed changes of CIN and SJ{\_}SA [convective inhibition energy and the subtropical south american jet] seem to be broadly consistent with those expected from forcing by greenhouse warming".

abstract = {We present the global general circulation model IPSL-CM5 developed to study the long-term response of the climate system to natural and anthropogenic forcings as part of the 5th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This model includes an interactive carbon cycle, a representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, and a comprehensive representation of aerosols. As it represents the principal dynamical, physical, and bio- geochemical processes relevant to the climate system, it may be referred to as an Earth System Model. However, the IPSL-CM5 model may be used in a multitude of configurations associated with different boundary condi- tions and with a range of complexities in terms of processes and interactions. This paper presents an overview of the different model components and that the behavior of some components of the climate system such as the Arctic sea ice and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation may change drastically by the end of the twenty-first century in the case of a no climate policy scenario. Although the magnitude of regional temperature and precipitation changes depends fairly linearly on the magnitude of the projected global warming (and thus on the scenario considered), the geographical pattern of these changes is strikingly similar for the different scenarios. The representation of atmospheric physical processes in the model is shown to strongly influence the simulated climate variability and both the magnitude and pattern of the pro- jected climate changes. Keywords explains how they were coupled and used to simulate historical climate changes over the past 150 years and different scenarios of future climate change. A single version of the IPSL-CM5 model (IPSL- CM5A-LR) was used to provide climate projections asso- ciated with different socio-economic scenarios, including the different Representative Concentration Pathways con- sidered by CMIP5 and several scenarios from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios considered by CMIP3. Results suggest that the magnitude of global warming pro- jections primarily depends on the socio-economic scenario considered, that there is potential for an aggressive mitiga- tion policy to limit global warming to about two degrees, and},

abstract = {There is increasing consensus that the global climate will continue to warm over the next century. The biodiversity-rich Amazon forest is a region of growing concern because many global climate model (GCM) scenarios of climate change forecast reduced pre- cipitation and, in some cases, coupled vegetation models predict dieback of the forest. To date, fires have generally been spatially co-located with road networks and associated human land use because almost all fires in this region are anthropogenic in origin. Climate change, if severe enough, could alter this situation, potentially changing the fire regime to one of increased fire frequency and severity for vast portions of the Amazon forest. High moisture contents and dense canopies have historically made Amazonian forests extremely resistant to fire spread. Climate will affect the fire situation in the Amazon directly, through changes in temperature and precipitation, and indirectly, through climate-forced changes in vegetation composition and structure. The frequency of drought will be a prime determinant of both how often forest fires occur and how extensive they become. Fire risk management needs to take into account landscape configuration, land cover types and forest disturbance history as well as climate and weather. Maintaining large blocks of unsettled forest is critical for managing landscape level fire in the Amazon. The Amazon has resisted previous climate changes and should adapt to future climates as well if landscapes can be managed to maintain natural fire regimes in the majority of forest remnants.},

abstract = {The possible responses of ecosystem processes to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change are illustrated using six dynamic global vegetation models that explicitly represent the interactions of ecosystem carbon and water exchanges with vegetation dynamics. The models are driven by the IPCC IS92a scenario of rising CO2 (Wigley et al. 1991), and by climate changes resulting from effective CO2 concentrations corresponding to IS92a, simulated by the coupled ocean atmosphere model HadCM2-SUL. Simulations with changing CO2 alone show a widely distributed terrestrial carbon sink of 1.4{\~{n}}3.8 PgCy{\~{n}}1 during the 1990s, rising to 3.7{\~{n}}8.6 PgCy{\~{n}}1 a century later. Simulations including climate change show a reduced sink both today (0.6{\~{n}} 3.0 PgCy{\~{n}}1) and a century later (0.3{\~{n}}6.6 PgCy{\~{n}}1) as a result of the impacts of climate change on NEP of tropical and southern hemisphere ecosystems. In all models, the rate of increase of NEP begins to level off around 2030 as a consequence of the `diminishing return' of physiological CO2 effects at high CO2 concentrations. Four out of the six models show a further, climate-induced decline in NEP resulting from increased heterotrophic respiration and declining tropical NPP after 2050. Changes in vegetation structure in{\_}uence the magnitude and spatial pattern of the carbon sink and, in combination with changing climate, also freshwater availability (runoff). It is shown that these changes, once set in motion, would continue to evolve for at least a century even if atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate could be instantaneously stabilized. The results should be considered illustrative in the sense that the choice of CO2 concentration scenario was arbitrary and only one climate model scenario was used. However, the results serve to indicate a range of possible biospheric responses to CO2 and climate change. They reveal major uncertainties about the response of NEP to climate change resulting, primarily, from differences in the way that modelled global NPP responds to a changing climate. The simulations illustrate, however, that the magnitude of possible biospheric in{\_}uences on the carbon balance requires that this factor is taken into account for future scenarios of atmospheric CO2 and climate change},

These observations reveal a distinct link between rainfall extremes and temperature, with heavy rain events increasing during warm periods and decreasing during cold periods. Furthermore, the observed amplification of rainfall extremes is found to be larger than that predicted by models, implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes in response to anthropogenic global warming may be underestimated.},

It is a merged analysis that incorporates precipitation estimates from low-orbit satellite microwave data, geosynchronous-orbit satellite infrared data, and surface rain gauge observations. The merging approach utilizes the higher accuracy of the low-orbit microwave observations to calibrate, or adjust, the more frequent geosynchronous infrared observations. The dataset is extended back into the premicrowave era (before mid-1987) by using infrared-only observations calibrated to the microwave-based analysis of the later years. The combined satellite-based product is adjusted by the rain gauge analysis. The dataset archive also contains the individual input fields, a combined satellite estimate, and error estimates for each field. This monthly analysis is the foundation for the GPCP suite of products, including those at finer temporal resolution. The 23-yr GPCP climatology is characterized, along with time and space variations of precipitation.},

abstract = {Five anthropogenic drivers--land use change, wood extraction, hunting, atmospheric change, climate change--will largely determine the future of tropical forests. The geographic scope and intensity of these five drivers are in flux. Contemporary land use change includes deforestation (approximately 64,000 km(2) yr(-1) for the entire tropical forest biome) and natural forests regenerating on abandoned land (approximately 21,500 km(2) yr(-1) with just 29{\%} of the biome evaluated). Commercial logging is shifting rapidly from Southeast Asia to Africa and South America, but local fuelwood consumption continues to constitute 71{\%} of all wood production. Pantropical rates of net deforestation are declining even as secondary and logged forests increasingly replace old-growth forests. Hunters reduce frugivore, granivore and browser abundances in most forests. This alters seed dispersal, seed and seedling survival, and hence the species composition and spatial template of plant regeneration. Tropical governments have responded to these local threats by protecting 7{\%} of all land for the strict conservation of nature--a commitment that is only matched poleward of 40 degrees S and 70 degrees N. Protected status often fails to stop hunters and is impotent against atmospheric and climate change. There are increasing reports of stark changes in the structure and dynamics of protected tropical forests. Four broad classes of mechanisms might contribute to these changes. Predictions are developed to distinguish among these mechanisms.},

This suggests a possibility of anthropogenic and external forcing of climate change in the southern Amazon. On average, the models project no changes in the frequency of occurrence of low SPI values in the future; however, those models which produce more realistic SPI climatology, variability and trend over the period 1970-1999 show more of a tendency towards more negative values of SPI in the future.

The intensity of precipitation extremes is widely held to increase proportionately to the increase in atmospheric water vapor content. Here, we show that this is not the case in 21st-century climate change scenarios simulated with climate models. In the tropics, precipitation extremes are not simulated reliably and do not change consistently among climate models; in the extratropics, they consistently increase more slowly than atmospheric water vapor content. We give a physical basis for how precipitation extremes change with climate and show that their changes depend on changes in the moist-adiabatic temperature lapse rate, in the upward velocity, and in the temperature when precipitation extremes occur. For the tropics, the theory suggests that improving the simulation of upward velocities in climate models is essential for improving predictions of precipitation extremes; for the extratropics, agreement with theory and the consistency among climate models increase confidence in the robustness of predictions of precipitation extremes under climate change.},

Central America sees a decrease of precipitation in both seasons. During the wet season here (May-Oct), the decrease is 9.44{\%}, and uring the dry season (Nov-Apr) the decrease is 17.34{\%}.

How the rain-bearing South American monsoon will evolve across the twenty-first century is thus a question of major interest. Extensive savanization, with its loss of forest carbon stock and uptake capacity, is an extreme although very uncertain scenario. We show that the contrasting rainfall projections simulated for Amazonia by 36 global climate models (GCMs) can be reproduced with empirical precipitation models, calibrated with historical GCM data as functions of the large-scale circulation. A set of these simple models was therefore calibrated with observations and used to constrain the GCM simulations. In agreement with the current hydrologic trends, the resulting projection towards the end of the twenty-first century is for a strengthening of the monsoon seasonal cycle, and a dry-season lengthening in southern Amazonia. With this approach, the increase in the area subjected to lengthy - savannah-prone - dry seasons is substantially larger than the GCM-simulated one. Our results confirm the dominant picture shown by the state-of-the-art GCMs, but suggest that the {\^{a}} € model democracy'view of these impacts can be significantly underestimated.},
annote = {Summary: This study uses 36 global climate models and creates a calibrated empirical precipitation model to determine the response of Amazonia to future warming. 
Conclusion: "The resulting projection towards the end of the 21st century is for a strengthening of the monsoon seasonal cycle, and a dry-season lengthening in southern Amazonia." 

Details: 
-The CMIP5 models struggle to simulate precipitation. Over Amazonia, about half simulate a "trend towards wetter conditions" in the next century. The other half show a drying trend (see Figure 1a). 
-Reasons for GCM differences include "model-specific sensitivites in mesoscale circulation and rainfall to phenomena such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation, or to change s in land-ocean temperature contrast." 
-To understand the mechnisms driving changes in amazonian precipitation simulated in the GCMs, the authors look at moisture flux convergence, breaking it down into thermodynamic and dynamic components. The dynamic component seems to correlate strongly with projected precipitation changes (see Figure 1e).
-Results from their empirical model shows "a marked rainfall decline is projected to the end of the twenty-first century in the late dry season,...whereas a moderate Pa increase is diagnosed in the wet season."
-On dry season length: tropicla rainforests dominate when the DSL is less than three months. When DSL increases above three, the amount of forest preesnt decreases. Unfortunately, "both the constrained and GCM projections indicate an expansion of the DSL{\_}3+ area", indicating forest area could decrease.
-The study finds that CMIP5 GCMs tend to underestimated the anthropogenic impacts on Amazonian precipitation. The authors conclude that the rainforest is likely to decline as rainfall lessens in southern Amazonia. But their model doesn't account for land surface feedback, which could be an important feature.},

As a dynamic vegetation model, it explicitly represents competitive processes such as light competition, sapling establishment, etc. It can thus be used in simulations for the study of feedbacks between transient climate and vegetation cover changes, but it can also be used with a prescribed vegetation distribution. The whole seasonal phenological cycle is prognostically calculated without any prescribed dates or use of satellite data. The model is coupled to the IPSL-CM4 coupled atmosphere- ocean-vegetation model.

Thirteen models have been selected in order to discuss (1) potential improvements in the simulation of present-day climate and (2) the potential reduction in the uncertainties of the model response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. While several features of present-day precipitation—including annual cycle, spatial distribution and co variability with tropical sea surface temperature (SST)—have been improved, strong uncertainties remain in the climate projections. A closer comparison between CMIP5 and CMIP3 highlights a weaker consensus on increased precipitation during the wet season, but a stronger consensus on a drying and lengthening of the dry season. The latter response is related to a northward shift of the boreal summer intertropical convergence zone in CMIP5, in line with a more asymmetric warming between the northern and southern hemispheres. The large uncertainties that persist in the rainfall response arise from contrasted anomalies in both moisture convergence and evapotranspiration. They might be related to the diverse response of tropical SST and ENSO (El Nin˜o Southern Oscillation) variability, as well as to spurious behaviours among the models that show the most extreme response. Model improvements of present-day climate do not necessarily translate into more reliable projections and further efforts are needed for constraining the pattern of the SST response and the soil moisture feedback in global climate scenarios.},

abstract = {Quantitative information on the response of global terrestrial net primary production (NPP) to climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 is essential for climate change adaptation and mitigation in the 21st century. Using a process-based ecosystem model (the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model, DLEM), we quantified the magnitude and spatiotemporal variations of contemporary (2000s) global NPP, and projected its potential responses to climate and CO2 changes in the 21st century under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B1 of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We estimated a global terrestrial NPP of 54.6 (52.8-56.4) PgC yr-1 as a result of multiple factors during 2000-2009. Climate change would either reduce global NPP (4.6{\%}) under the A2 scenario or slightly enhance NPP (2.2{\%}) under the B1 scenario during 2010-2099. In response to climate change, global NPP would first increase until surface air temperature increases by 1.5°C (until the 2030s) and then level-off or decline after it increases by more than 1.5°C (after the 2030s). This result supports the Copenhagen Accord Acknowledgement, which states that staying below 2°C may not be sufficient and the need to potentially aim for staying below 1.5°C. The CO2 fertilization effect would result in a 12{\%}-13.9{\%} increase in global NPP during the 21st century. The relative CO2 fertilization effect, i.e. change in NPP on per CO2 (ppm) bases, is projected to first increase quickly then level off in the 2070s and even decline by the end of the 2080s, possibly due to CO2 saturation and nutrient limitation. Terrestrial NPP responses to climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2 largely varied among biomes, with the largest increases in the tundra and boreal needleleaf deciduous forest. Compared to the low emission scenario (B1), the high emission scenario (A2) would lead to larger spatiotemporal variations in NPP, and more dramatic and counteracting impacts from climate and increasing atmospheric CO2.},

This paper describes developments to all CCSM components, and documents fully coupled preindustrial control runs compared to the previous version, CCSM3. Using the standard atmosphere and land resolution of 1° results in the sea surface temperature biases in the major upwelling regions being comparable to the 1.4°-resolution CCSM3.

abstract = {Terrestrial net primary production (NPP) quantifies the amount of atmospheric carbon fixed by plants and accumulated as biomass. Previous studies have shown that climate constraints were relaxing with increasing temperature and solar radiation, allowing an upward trend in NPP from 1982 through 1999. The past decade (2000 to 2009) has been the warmest since instrumental measurements began, which could imply continued increases in NPP; however, our estimates suggest a reduction in the global NPP of 0.55 petagrams of carbon. Large-scale droughts have reduced regional NPP, and a drying trend in the Southern Hemisphere has decreased NPP in that area, counteracting the increased NPP over the Northern Hemisphere. A continued decline in NPP would not only weaken the terrestrial carbon sink, but it would also intensify future competition between food demand and proposed biofuel production.},

abstract = {Amazon forests are a key but poorly understood component of the global carbon cycle. If, as anticipated, they dry this century, they might accelerate climate change through carbon losses and changed surface energy balances. We used records from multiple long-term monitoring plots across Amazonia to assess forest responses to the intense 2005 drought, a possible analog of future events. Affected forest lost biomass, reversing a large long-term carbon sink, with the greatest impacts observed where the dry season was unusually intense. Relative to pre-2005 conditions, forest subjected to a 100-millimeter increase in water deficit lost 5.3 megagrams of aboveground biomass of carbon per hectare. The drought had a total biomass carbon impact of 1.2 to 1.6 petagrams (1.2 × 1015 to 1.6 × 1015 grams). Amazon forests therefore appear vulnerable to increasing moisture stress, with the potential for large carbon losses to exert feedback on climate change.},

abstract = {We examine the evidence for the possibility that 21st-century climate change may cause a large-scale "dieback" or degradation of Amazonian rainforest. We employ a new framework for evaluating the rainfall regime of tropical forests and from this deduce precipitation-based boundaries for current forest viability. We then examine climate simulations by 19 global climate models (GCMs) in this context and find that most tend to underestimate current rainfall. GCMs also vary greatly in their projections of future climate change in Amazonia. We attempt to take into account the differences between GCM-simulated and observed rainfall regimes in the 20th century. Our analysis suggests that dry-season water stress is likely to increase in E. Amazonia over the 21st century, but the region tends toward a climate more appropriate to seasonal forest than to savanna. These seasonal forests may be resilient to seasonal drought but are likely to face intensified water stress caused by higher temperatures and to be vulnerable to fires, which are at present naturally rare in much of Amazonia. The spread of fire ignition associated with advancing deforestation, logging, and fragmentation may act as nucleation points that trigger the transition of these seasonal forests into fire-dominated, low biomass forests. Conversely, deliberate limitation of deforestation and fire may be an effective intervention to maintain Amazonian forest resilience in the face of imposed 21st-century climate change. Such intervention may be enough to navigate E. Amazonia away from a possible "tipping point," beyond which extensive rainforest would become unsustainable.},

abstract = {While a majority of global climate models project drier and longer dry seasons over the Amazon under higher CO2 levels, large uncertainties surround the response of vegetation to persistent droughts in both present-day and future climates. We propose a detailed evaluation of the ability of the ISBACC (Interaction Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere Carbon Cycle) land surface model to capture drought effects on both water and carbon budgets, comparing fluxes and stocks at two recent throughfall exclusion (TFE) experiments performed in the Amazon. We also explore the model sensitivity to different water stress functions (WSFs) and to an idealized increase in CO2 concentration and/or temperature. In spite of a reasonable soil moisture simulation, ISBACC struggles to correctly simulate the vegetation response to TFE whose amplitude and timing is highly sensitive to the WSF. Under higher CO2 concentrations, the increased water-use efficiency (WUE) mitigates the sensitivity of ISBACC to drought. While one of the proposed WSF formulations improves the response of most ISBACC fluxes, except respiration, a parameterization of drought-induced tree mortality is missing for an accurate estimate of the vegetation response. Also, a better mechanistic understanding of the forest responses to drought under a warmer climate and higher CO2 concentration is clearly needed.},

abstract = {Future intensification of Amazon drought resulting from climate change may cause increased fire activity, tree mortality, and emissions of carbon to the atmosphere across large areas of Amazonia. To provide a basis for addressing these issues, we examine properties of recent and future meteorological droughts in the Amazon in 35 climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). We find that the CMIP5 climate models, as a group, simulate important properties of historical meteorological droughts in the Amazon. In addition, this group of models reproduces observed relationships between Amazon precipitation and regional sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans. Assuming the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario for future drivers of climate change, the models project increases in the frequency and geographic extent of meteorological drought in the eastern Amazon, and the opposite in the West. For the region as a whole, the CMIP5 models suggest that the area affected by mild and severe meteorological drought will nearly double and triple, respectively, by 2100. Extremes of wetness are also projected to increase after 2040. Specifically, the frequency of periods of unusual wetness and the area affected by unusual wetness are projected to increase after 2040 in the Amazon as a whole, including in locations where annual mean precipitation is projected to decrease. Our analyses suggest that continued emissions of greenhouse gases will increase the likelihood of extreme events that have been shown to alter and degrade Amazonian forests.},
annote = {Droughts during the 2000s had a noticeable impact on tree mortality and decreased growth levels. About 1-2{\%} of the carbon stored in the Amazon forests were emitted to the atmosphere as a result. 
Model simulations of response to drought are usually smaller than that's actually observed. There's two explanations for this: "First, most ecosystem models lack a mechanism to represent short-term carbon losses resulting frrom severe drought events....The second explanation relates to the ability of climate models to represent basic drought conditions." 
The authors compare observational data sets to get an estimate of observational uncertainty. They then compare the differences between the models and observations, and find that a fair number of them are performing well in that they have errors within the error estimated due to observational uncertainty. 
"Mean annual precipitation is projected to increase in the western Amazon and to decrease in the eastern part of hte region." The wet months could see more rain and the dry months less, in a regional version of the wet-get-wetter and dry-get-drier convention.
This paper's calculation of a drought index does NOT take into account changes in temperature, only changes in precipitation. 
"The CMIP5 models project about a 10-fold increase by 2100 in the drought area...in regions were mean precipitation is projected to decrease - most of the Amazon basin." This is caused by "a differential warming of SSTs in the eastern tropical Pacific."Alternatively, regions that see increases in precipitation are likely to see increased occurence of "unusual wetness". 
"The recent droughts in 2005 and 2010 in some ways are analogs for projected future conditions. First, droughts of similar intensity... are projected to greatly incrase in frequency; hence the impacts of these recent droughts may ofer some insight into future drought impacts." Also, these particular droughts "were accompanied by unusual wetness in the northeast part of the basin". --{\textgreater} I think this is also good motivational material - are we already seeing what we could expect more of in the future? 
A number of other things impact drought - deforestation, for example, can lower evapotranspiration and thus lower precipitation.},

The thermohaline circulation, for the most part, is an ‘overturning' circulation in which warm water flows poleward near the surface and is subsequently converted into cold water that sinks and flows equatorward in the in- terior.

In this study we test the hypothesis that future interannual Arctic sea ice area variability will increase by utilizing 40 independent simulations from the Community Earth System Model's Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) for the 1920–2100 period and augment this with simulations from 12 models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Both CESM-LE and CMIP5 models project that ice area variability will indeed grow substantially but not monotonically in every month. There is also a strong seasonal dependence in the magnitude and timing of future variability increases that is robust among CESM ensemble members. The variability generally correlates with the average ice retreat rate, before there is an eventual disappearance in both terms as the ice pack becomes seasonal in summer and autumn by late century. The peak in variability correlates best with the total area of ice between 0.2 and 0.6{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m monthly thickness, indicating that substantial future thinning of the ice pack is required before variability maximizes.

abstract = {Widespread synchronous wildfires driven by climatic variation, such as those that swept western North America during 1996, 2000, and 2002, can result in major environmental and societal impacts. Understanding relationships between continental-scale patterns of drought and modes of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) such as El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) may explain how interannual to multidecadal variability in SSTs drives fire at continental scales. We used local wildfire chronologies reconstructed from fire scars on tree rings across western North America and independent reconstructions of SST developed from tree-ring widths at other sites to examine the relationships of multicentury patterns of climate and fire synchrony. From 33,039 annually resolved fire-scar dates at 238 sites (the largest paleofire record yet assembled), we examined forest fires at regional and subcontinental scales. Since 1550 CE, drought and forest fires covaried across the West, but in a manner contingent on SST modes. During certain phases of ENSO and PDO, fire was synchronous within broad subregions and sometimes asynchronous among those regions. In contrast, fires were most commonly synchronous across the West during warm phases of the AMO. ENSO and PDO were the main drivers of high-frequency variation in fire (interannual to decadal), whereas the AMO conditionally changed the strength and spatial influence of ENSO and PDO on wildfire occurrence at multidecadal scales. A current warming trend in AMO suggests that we may expect an increase in widespread, synchronous fires across the western U.S. in coming decades.},

abstract = {Atmospheric measurements were made over Arctic sea ice north of Svalbard from winter to early summer (January-June) 2015 during the Norwegian Young Sea Ice (N-ICE2015) expedition. These measurements, which are available publicly, represent a comprehensive meteorological data set covering the seasonal transition in the Arctic Basin over the new, thinner sea ice regime. Winter was characterized by a succession of storms that produced short-lived (less than 48 h) temperature increases of 20 to 30 K at the surface. These storms were driven by the hemispheric scale circulation pattern with a large meridional component of the polar jet stream steering North Atlantic storms into the high Arctic. Nonstorm periods during winter were characterized by strong surface temperature inversions due to strong radiative cooling (“radiatively clear state”). The strength and depth of these inversions were similar to those during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) campaign. In contrast, atmospheric profiles during the “opaquely cloudy state” were different to those from SHEBA due to differences in the synoptic conditions and location within the ice pack. Storm events observed during spring/summer were the result of synoptic systems located in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Basin rather than passing directly over N-ICE2015. These synoptic systems were driven by a large-scale circulation pattern typical of recent years, with an Arctic Dipole pattern developing during June. Surface temperatures became near-constant 0°C on 1 June marking the beginning of summer. Atmospheric profiles during the spring and early summer show persistent lifted temperature and moisture inversions that are indicative of clouds and cloud processes.},

In view of these observations, a representation of moist convective transports for use in large-scale models is constructed, in which the fundamental entities are these subcloud-scale drafts rather than the clouds themselves. The transport by these small-scale drafts is idealized as follows. Air from the subcloud layer is lifted to each level i between cloud base and the level of neutral buoyancy for undilute air. A fraction (ϵi) of the condensed water is then converted to precipitation, which falls and partially or completely evaporates in an unsaturated downdraft. The remaining cloudy air is then assumed to form a uniform spectrum of mixtures with environmental air at level i; these mixtures ascend or descend according to their buoyancy.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}![CDATA[Abstract. Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management. The full ERA5-Land hourly (Mu{\~{n}}oz-Sabater, 2019a) and monthly (Mu{\~{n}}oz-Sabater, 2019b) averaged datasets presented in this paper are available through the C3S Climate Data Store at https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac and https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.68d2bb30, respectively.]]{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

From these data, we produce a pan-Arctic assessment of GIC mass imbalance, and we partition their losses into signals associated with atmospheric processes and glacier dynamics. Between 2010 and 2017, Arctic GIC lost 609 ± 7 Gt of ice, contributing 0.240 ± 0.007 mm per year to global sea level rise. While surface ablation is responsible for 87{\%} of losses across the Arctic, dynamic imbalance is increasing in the Barents and Kara Sea region where it now accounts for 43{\%} of total ice loss.

HadCRUT5 presents monthly average near-surface temperature anomalies, relative to the 1961–1990 period, on a regular 5° latitude by 5° longitude grid from 1850 to 2018. HadCRUT5 is a combination of sea-surface temperature (SST) measurements over the ocean from ships and buoys and near-surface air temperature measurements from weather stations over the land surface. These data have been sourced from updated compilations and the adjustments applied to mitigate the impact of changes in SST measurement methods have been revised. Two variants of HadCRUT5 have been produced for use in different applications. The first represents temperature anomaly data on a grid for locations where measurement data are available. The second, more spatially complete, variant uses a Gaussian process based statistical method to make better use of the available observations, extending temperature anomaly estimates into regions for which the underlying measurements are informative. Each is provided as a 200-member ensemble accompanied by additional uncertainty information. The combination of revised input data sets and statistical analysis results in greater warming of the global average over the course of the whole record. In recent years, increased warming results from an improved representation of Arctic warming and a better understanding of evolving biases in SST measurements from ships. These updates result in greater consistency with other independent global surface temperature data sets, despite their different approaches to data set construction, and further increase confidence in our understanding of changes seen.},

Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a coupled instability

is briefly described, and the physics of the ENSO
cycle is discussed. Particular attention is given to
the Bjerknes feedback, the instability mechanism
which figures prominently in ENSO past and
future. Our knowledge of ENSO in the paleoclimate
record has expanded rapidly within the last 5
yr. The ENSO cycle is present in all relevant
records, going back 130 kyr. It was systematically
weaker during the early and middle Holocene, and
model studies indicate that this results from
reduced amplification in the late summer and early
fall, a consequence of the altered mean climate in
response to boreal summer perihelion. Data from
corals shows substantial decadal and longer
variations in the strength of the ENSO cycle within
the past 1000 yr; it is suggested that this may be
due to solar and volcanic variations in solar
insolation, amplified by the Bjerknes
feedback. There is some evidence that this feedback
has operated in the 20th century and some model
results indicate that it will hold sway in the
greenhouse future, but it is very far from
conclusive. The comprehensive general circulation
models used for future climate projections leave us
with an indeterminate picture of ENSO's future. Some
predict more ENSO activity, some less, with the
highly uncertain consensus forecast indicating
little change. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

indicator of drought severity, and a particular
index value is often the signal to begin or

recently developed to quantify a precipitation
deficit for different time scales. It was designed
to be an indicator of drought that recognizes the
importance of time scales in the analysis of water
availability and water use. This study compares
historical time series of the PDI with time series
of the corresponding SPI through spectral
analysis. Results show that the spectral
characteristics of the PDI vary from site to site
throughout the U.S., while those of the SPI do not
vary from site to site. They also show that the PDI
has a complex structure with an exceptionally long
memory, while the SPI is an easily interpreted,
simple moving average process.},

abstract = {Abstract Ice concentration is a critical parameter of the polar marine environment because of the large effect sea ice has on the surface albedo and heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean. Simulations of the energy exchange processes in models would benefit if the ice concentration were represented more accurately. Reanalysis simulations that use historical wind and temperature fields may develop erroneous ice concentration estimates; these can be corrected by using observed ice concentration fields. The ice concentration assimilation presented here is a new method based on nudging the model ice concentration toward the observed concentration in a manner that emphasizes the ice extent and minimizes the effect of observational errors in the interior of the pack. The nudging weight is a nonlinear function of the difference between the model and the observed ice concentration. The simulated ice extent is improved with the assimilation of ice concentration but is not identical to the observed exte...},

The climatology reveals cold-air damming is a year-round phenomenon in the southern Appalachians with the most frequent, prolonged and intense events occurring in winter (particularly December and March) when three-five events per month can be expected. Cold-air damming is least frequent and intense in July. The synoptic case study reveals that cold-air damming is critically dependent upon the configuration of the synoptic-scale flow. The cold dome can be identified by a “U” shaped ridge (trough) in the sea level isobar (thermal) patterns and the 930-mb height (temperature) fields representative of conditions at the base of the inversion overlying the cold dome.

It describes the evolution of soil moisture, soil temperature and snowpack. ERA-Interim/Land is the result of a single 32-year simulation with the latest ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) land surface model driven by meteorological forcing from the ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis and precipitation adjustments based on monthly GPCP v2.1 (Global Precipitation Climatology Project). The horizontal resolution is about 80 km and the time frequency is 3-hourly. ERA-Interim/Land includes a number of parameterization improvements in the land surface scheme with respect to the original ERA-Interim data set, which makes it more suitable for climate studies involving land water resources. The quality of ERA-Interim/Land is assessed by comparing with ground-based and remote sensing observations. In particular, estimates of soil moisture, snow depth, surface albedo, turbulent latent and sensible fluxes, and river discharges are verified against a large number of site measurements. ERA-Interim/Land provides a global integrated and coherent estimate of soil moisture and snow water equivalent, which can also be used for the initialization of numerical weather prediction and climate models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), is the latest atmospheric reanalysis of the modern satellite era produced by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). MERRA-2 assimilates observation types not available to its predecessor, MERRA, and includes updates to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model and analysis scheme so as to provide a viable ongoing climate analysis beyond MERRA's terminus. While addressing known limitations of MERRA, MERRA-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis (IESA) currently under development at GMAO. This paper provides an overview of the MERRA-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in MERRA-2 relevant to IESA are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of MERRA-2 compared with MERRA include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified. Production of MERRA-2 began in June 2014 in four processing streams and converged to a single near-real-time stream in mid-2015. MERRA-2 products are accessible online through the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC).},

Analyzing a 2012 survey of nearly 5000 corn farmers across 22 Midwestern U.S. Watersheds, we investigate the most common weather and climate risk management strategies, including purchasing additional crop insurance, implementing conservation practices, and adding new technology. U.S. farmers' belief in anthropogenic climate change, perceptions of changing weather patterns, climate risks to their farm and attitudes toward adapting are analyzed. Farmers' perceptions of risk to their own farm, attitudes toward innovation and adaptation attitudes were the most important determinants of adaptation. This study highlights the critical role of risk perceptions in adaptation attitudes as well as behaviors among agriculturalists. Finally, we discuss how these findings could be applied to increase uptake of adaptation strategies and thus resilience of U.S. agriculture to a changing climate.},

The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of CESM2(CAM6) is 5.3°C, and CESM2(WACCM6) is 4.8°C, while the transient climate response (TCR) is 2.1°C in CESM2(CAM6) and 2.0°C in CESM2(WACCM6). Thus, these two CESM2 model versions have higher values of ECS than the previous generation of model, the CESM (CAM5) (hereafter CESM1), that had an ECS of 4.1°C, though the CESM2 versions have lower values of TCR compared to the CESM1 with a somewhat higher value of 2.3°C. All model versions produce credible simulations of the time evolution of historical global surface temperature. The higher ECS values for the CESM2 versions are reflected in higher values of global surface temperature increase by 2,100 in CESM2(CAM6) and CESM2(WACCM6) compared to CESM1 between comparable emission scenarios for the high forcing scenario. Future warming among CESM2 model versions and scenarios diverges around 2050. The larger values of TCR and ECS in CESM2(CAM6) compared to CESM1 are manifested by greater warming in the tropics. Associated with a higher climate sensitivity, for CESM2(CAM6) the first instance of an ice-free Arctic in September occurs for all scenarios and ensemble members in the 2030–2050 time frame, but about a decade later in CESM2(WACCM6), occurring around 2040–2060.},

In contrast with previously proposed methods, TracIn is simple to implement; all it needs is the ability to work with gradients, checkpoints, and loss functions. The method is general. It applies to any machine learning model trained using stochastic gradient descent or a variant of it, agnostic of architecture, domain and task.

abstract = {There were extensive regions of Arctic temperature extremes in January and February 2016 that continued into April. For January, the Arctic-wide averaged temperature anomaly was 2.0°C above the previous record of 3.0°C based on four reanalysis products. Midlatitude atmospheric circulation played a major role in producing such extreme temperatures. Extensive low geopotential heights at 700 hPa extended over the southeastern United States, across the Atlantic, and well into the Arctic. Low geopotential heights along the Aleutian Islands and a ridge along northwestern North America contributed southerly wind flow. These two regions of low geopotential height were seen as a major split in the tropospheric polar vortex over the Arctic. Warm air advection north of central Eurasia reinforced the ridge that split the flow near the North Pole. Winter 2015 and 2016 geopotential height fields represented an eastward shift in the longwave atmospheric circulation pattern compared to earlier in the decade (2010-13). Certainly Arctic amplification will continue, and 2016 shows that there can be major Arctic contributions from midlatitudes. Whether Arctic amplification feedbacks are accelerated by the combination of recent thinner, more mobile Arctic sea ice and occasional extreme atmospheric circulation events from midlatitudes is an interesting conjecture.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Extreme weather events in Asia have been occurring with increasing frequency as the globe warms in response to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. Many of these events arise from weather regimes that persist over a region for days or even weeks, resulting in disruptive heatwaves, droughts, flooding, snowfalls, and cold spells. We investigate changes in the persistence of large-scale weather systems through a pattern-recognition approach based on daily 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies over the Asian continent. By tracking consecutive days that the atmosphere resides in a particular pattern, we identify long-duration events (LDEs), defined as lasting longer than three days, and measure their frequency of occurrence over time in each pattern. We find that regimes featuring positive height anomalies in high latitudes are occurring more often as the Arctic warms faster than mid-latitudes, both in the recent past and in model projections for the twenty-first century assuming unabated greenhouse gas emissions. The increased dominance of these patterns corresponds to a higher likelihood of LDEs, suggesting that persistent weather conditions will occur more frequently. By mapping observed temperature and precipitation extremes onto each atmospheric regime, we gain insight into the types of disruptive weather events that will become more prevalent as particular patterns become more common.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

of limited water resources in northeastern
Mexico. The objective of this study was to develop a
network of tree-ring chronologies to reconstruct
hydroclimate variability in northeastern Mexico and
to analyze the influence of large-scale circulation
patterns, such as ENSO. Precipitation sensitive
tree-ring chronologies of Douglas-fir were developed
in mountain ranges of the Sierra Madre Oriental and
used to produce winter-spring precipitation
reconstructions for central and southern Nuevo Leon,
and southeastern Coahuila. The seasonal
winter-spring precipitation reconstructions are 342
years long (1659-2001) for Saltillo, Coahuila and
602 years long (1400-2002) for central and southern
Nuevo Leon. Both reconstructions show droughts in
the 1810s, 1870s, 1890s, 1910s, and 1970s, and wet
periods in the 1770s, 1930s, 1960s, and 1980s. Prior
to 1800s the reconstructions are less similar. The
impact of ENSO in northeastern Mexico (as measured
by the Tropical Rainfall Index) indicated long-term
instability of the Pacific equatorial
teleconnection. Atmospheric circulation systems
coming from higher latitudes (cold fronts or
`nortes') and others developed in the Gulf of Mexico
(tropical storms, hurricanes) also influence the
climatic conditions characterizing this region. The
recent development of new and longer tree-ring
chronologies for the region will contribute to a
better understanding of the interannual and
multidecadal climatic variability of northeastern
Mexico.},

chronologies from overlapping segments of
cross-dated ring-width series is reviewed, with an
emphasis on preserving very low-frequency signals

fundamental statistical problem coined the 'segment
length curse' is introduced. This 'curse' is related
to the fact that the maximum wavelength of
recoverable climatic information is ordinarily
related to the lengths of the individual tree-ring
series used to construct the millennia-long
chronology. Simple experiments with sine waves are
used to illustrate this fact. This is followed by
more realistic experiments using a long bristlecone
pine series that is randomly cut into a number of
1000-, 500- and 200-year segments and standardized
using three very conservative methods. When compared
against the original, uncut series, the resulting
'chronologies' show the effects of segment length
even when the most conservative and noncommittal
method of tree-ring standardization is applied
(i.e., a horizontal line through the
mean). Alternative schemes of chronology development
are described that seek to exorcise the segment
length curse. While they show some promise, none is
universal in its applicability and this problem

abstract = {Both the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) are regularly employed in model evaluation studies. Willmott and Matsuura (2005) have suggested that the RMSE is not a good indicator of average model performance and might be a misleading indicator of average error, and thus the MAE would be a better metric for that purpose. While some concerns over using RMSE raised by Willmott and Matsuura (2005) and Willmott et al. (2009) are valid, the proposed avoidance of RMSE in favor of MAE is not the solution. Citing the aforementioned papers, many researchers chose MAE over RMSE to present their model evaluation statistics when presenting or adding the RMSE measures could be more beneficial. In this technical note, we demonstrate that the RMSE is not ambiguous in its meaning, contrary to what was claimed by Willmott et al. (2009). The RMSE is more appropriate to represent model performance than the MAE when the error distribution is expected to be Gaussian. In addition, we show that the RMSE satisfies the triangle inequality requirement for a distance metric, whereas Willmott et al. (2009) indicated that the sums-of-squares-based statistics do not satisfy this rule. In the end, we discussed some circumstances where using the RMSE will be more beneficial. However, we do not contend that the RMSE is superior over the MAE. Instead, a combination of metrics, including but certainly not limited to RMSEs and MAEs, are often required to assess model performance. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2014.

abstract = {AbstractIn recent decades, the Greenland ice sheet has experienced increased surface melt. However, the underlying cause of this increased surface melting and how it relates to cryospheric changes across the Arctic remain unclear. Here we show that an important contributing factor is the decreasing Arctic sea ice. Reduced summer sea ice favors stronger and more frequent occurrences of blocking-high pressure events over Greenland. Blocking highs enhance the transport of warm, moist air over Greenland, which increases downwelling infrared radiation, contributes to increased extreme heat events, and accounts for the majority of the observed warming trends. These findings are supported by analyses of observations and reanalysis data, as well as by independent atmospheric model simulations using a state-of-the-art atmospheric model that is forced by varying only the sea ice conditions. Reduced sea ice conditions in the model favor more extensive Greenland surface melting. We find that a positive feedback betwe...},

abstract = {The performance of a new historical reanalysis, the NOAA–CIRES–DOE Twentieth Century Reanalysis version 3 (20CRv3), is evaluated via comparisons with other reanalyses and independent observations. This dataset provides global, 3-hourly estimates of the atmosphere from 1806 to 2015 by assimilating only surface pressure observations and prescribing sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, and radiative forcings. Comparisons with independent observations, other reanalyses, and satellite products suggest that 20CRv3 can reliably produce atmospheric estimates on scales ranging from weather events to long-term climatic trends. Not only does 20CRv3 recreate a ‘‘best estimate'' of the weather, including extreme events, it also provides an estimate of its confidence through the use of an ensemble. Surface pressure statistics suggest that these confidence estimates are reliable. Comparisons with independent upper-air observations in the Northern Hemisphere demonstrate that 20CRv3 has skill throughout the twentieth century. Upper-air fields from 20CRv3 in the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century correlate well with full-input reanalyses, and the correlation is predicted by the confidence fields from 20CRv3. The skill of analyzed 500-hPa geopotential heights from 20CRv3 for 1979–2015 is comparable to that of modern operational 3–4-day forecasts. Finally, 20CRv3 performs well on climate time scales. Long time series and multidecadal averages of mass, circulation, and precipitation fields agree well with modern reanalyses and station- and satellite-based products. 20CRv3 is also able to capture trends in tropospheric-layer temperatures that correlate well with independent products in the twentieth century, placing recent trends in a longer historical context.},

abstract = {The authors exploit the remarkable similarity
between recent climate trends and the structure of
the "annular modes" in the month-to-month
variability (as described in a companion paper) to
partition the trends into components linearly
congruent with and linearly independent of the
annular modes. The index of the Northern Hemisphere
(NH) annular mode, referred to as the Arctic
Oscillation (AO), has exhibited a trend toward the
high index polarity over the past few decades. The
largest and most significant trends are observed
during the "active season" for stratospheric
planetary wave-mean flow interaction, January-March
(JFM), when fluctuations in the AO amplify with
height into the lower stratosphere. For the periods
of record considered, virtually all of the JFM
geopotential height falls over the polar cap region
and the strengthening of the subpolar westerlies
from the surface to the lower stratosphere, similar
to 50{\%} of the JFM warming over the Eurasian
continent, similar to 30{\%} of the JFM warming over
the NH as a whole, similar to 40{\%} of the JFM
stratospheric cooling over the polar cap region, and
similar to 40{\%} of the March total column ozone
losses poleward of 40 degrees N are linearly
congruent with month-to-month variations in the AO
index. Summertime sea level pressure falls over the
Arctic basin are suggestive of a year-round drift
toward the positive polarity of the AO, but the
evidence is less conclusive. Owing to the
photochemical memory inherent in the ozone
distribution, roughly half the ozone depletion
during the NH summer months is linearly dependent on
AO-related ozone lasses incurred during the previous
active season. Lower-tropospheric geopotential
height falls over the Antarctic polar cap region are
indicative of a drift toward the high index polarity
of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode with no
apparent seasonality. In contrast, the trend toward
a cooling and strengthening of the SH stratospheric
polar vortex peaks sharply during the stratosphere's
relatively short active season centered in
November. The most pronounced SE ozone losses have
occurred in September-October, one or two months
prior to this active season. In both hemispheres,
positive feedbacks involving ozone destruction,
cooling, and a weakening of the wave-driven
meridional circulation may be contributing to a
delayed breakdown of the polar vortex and enhanced
ozone losses during spring.},

Japanese Reanalysis (JRA-25) temperatures from 1979

30 degrees N to 30 degrees S, with results projected
globally onto various other fields. The first two
empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) both have
primary relationships to El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) but feature rather different
vertical and spatial structures. By construction the
two patterns are orthogonal, but their signatures in
sea level pressure, precipitation, outgoing longwave
radiation (OLR), and tropospheric diabatic heating
are quite similar. Moreover, they are significantly
related, with EOF-2 leading EOF-1 by about 4 -6
months, indicating that they play complementary
roles in the evolution of ENSO events, and with each
mode playing greater or lesser roles in different
events and seasons. The dominant pattern (EOF-1) in
its positive sign features highly coherent zonal
mean warming throughout the tropical troposphere
from 30 degrees N to 30 degrees S that increases in
magnitude with height to 200 hPa, drops to zero
about 100 hPa at the tropopause, and has reverse
sign to 30 hPa with peak values at 70 hPa. It
correlates strongly with global mean surface
temperatures. EOF-2 emphasizes off-equatorial
centers of action and strong Rossby wave temperature
signatures that are coherent throughout the
troposphere, with the strongest values in the
Pacific that extend into the extratropics and a sign
reversal at and above 150 hPa. Near the surface,
both patterns feature boomerang-shaped opposite
temperatures in the western tropical and subtropical
Pacific, with similar sea level pressure patterns,
but with EOF-1 more focused in equatorial
regions. Both patterns are strongest during the
boreal winter half-year when anomalous precipitation
in the tropics and associated latent heating drive
teleconnections throughout the world. For El Nino in
northern winter EOF-1 has more precipitation in the
eastern tropical Pacific, while EOF-2 has much drier
conditions over northern Australia and the Indian
Ocean. In northern summer, the main differences are
in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean. Differences
in teleconnections suggest great sensitivity to
small changes in forcings in association with
seasonal variations in the mean state.},

abstract = {Globally averaged surface air temperatures in some decades show rapid increases (accelerated warming decades), and in other decades there is no warming trend (hiatus decades). A previous study showed that the net energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere of about 1Wm22 is associated with greater increases of deep ocean heat content below 750m during the hiatus decades, while there is little globally averaged surface temperature increase or warming in the upper ocean layers. Here the authors examine processes involved with accelerated warming decades and address the relative roles of external forcing from increasing greenhouse gases and internally generated decadal climate variability associated with interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO). Model results from the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), show that accelerated warming decades are characterized by rapid warming of globally averaged surface air temperature, greater increases of heat content in the upper ocean layers, and less heat content increase in the deep ocean, opposite to the hiatus decades. In addition to contributions from processes potentially linked to Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), the positive phase of the IPO, adding to the response to external forcing, is usually associated with accelerated warming decades. Conversely, hiatus decades typically occur with the negative phase of the IPO, when warming from the external forcing is overwhelmed by internally generated cooling in the tropical Pacific. Internally generated hiatus periods of up to 15 years with zero global warming trend are present in the future climate simulations. This suggests that there is a chance that the current observed hiatus could extend for several more years. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

climate variability have been carried out in order
to understand patterns of natural climate
variability, on decade to century timescales, and
the role of anthropogenic forcing(1 - 8). These
reconstructions have mainly used tree- ring data and
other data sets of annual to decadal
resolution. Lake and ocean sediments have a lower
time resolution, but provide climate information at
multicentennial timescales that may not be captured
by tree- ring data(9,10). Here we reconstruct
Northern Hemisphere temperatures for the past 2,000
years by combining low- resolution proxies with
tree- ring data, using a wavelet transform
technique(11) to achieve timescale- dependent
processing of the data. Our reconstruction shows
larger multicentennial variability than most
previous multi- proxy reconstructions(1 - 4,7), but
agrees well with temperatures reconstructed from
borehole measurements(12) and with temperatures
obtained with a general circulation
model(13,14). According to our reconstruction, high
temperatures - similar to those observed in the
twentieth century before 1990 occurred around AD
1000 to 1100, and minimum temperatures that are
about 0.7K below the average of 1961 - 90 occurred
around AD 1600. This large natural variability in
the past suggests an important role of natural
multicentennial variability that is likely to
continue.},

evaluated with a continuous baseline integration
driven by the NCEP Department of Energy (DOE) Second
Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project Reanalysis

pronounced downscaling skill for precipitation and
temperature interannual variations. The EOF and
correlation analyses illustrate that, for both
quantities, the CMM5 captures the spatial pattern,
temporal evolution, and circulation teleconnections
much better than the R-2. In particular, the CMM5
more realistically simulates the precipitation
pattern centered in the Northwest, where the
representation of the orographic enhancement by the
forced uplifting during winter (rainy season) is
greatly improved over the R-2. The downscaling
skill, however, is sensitive to the cumulus
parameterization. This sensitivity is studied by
comparing the baseline with a branch summer
integration replacing the Grell with the
Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme in the CMM5. The
dominant EOF mode of the U. S. summer precipitation
interannual variation, identified with the
out-of-phase relationship between the Midwest and

accurately by the Grell than the Kain-Fritsch
scheme, which largely underestimates the variation
in the Midwest. This pattern is associated with
east-west movement of the Great Plains low-level jet

stronger southerly flow bringing more moisture and
heavier rainfall in the Midwest and less in the

the consistent variation over the southern part of

captured better by the Kain-Fritsch scheme than the

@article{sheppard02,
abstract = {This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge
of the climate of southwest USA (the 'Southwest'),
Low annual precipitation, clear skies, and
year-round warm climate over much of the Southwest
are due in large part to a quasi-permanent
subtropical high-pressure ridge over the
region. However, the Southwest is located between
the mid-latitude and subtropical atmospheric
circulation regimes, and this positioning relative
to shifts in these regimes is the fundamental reason
for the region's climatic variability. Furthermore,
the Southwest's complex topography and its
geographical proximity to the Pacific Ocean, the
Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico also
contribute to this region's high climatic
variability, El Nino, which is an increase in
sea-surface temperature of the eastern equatorial
Pacific Ocean with an associated shift of the active
center of atmospheric convection from the western to
the central equatorial Pacific, has a well-developed
teleconnection with the Southwest, usually resulting
in wet winters. La Nina, the opposite oceanic case
of El Nino usually results in dry winters for the
Southwest. Another important oceanic influence on
winter climate of the Southwest is a feature called
the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which has
been defined as temporal variation in sea-surface
temperatures for most of the Northern Pacific Ocean,
The effects of ENSO and PDO can amplify each other,
resulting in increased annual variability in
precipitation over the Southwest. The major feature
that sets the climate of the Southwest apart from
the rest of the United States is the North American
monsoon, which in the US is most noticeable in
Arizona and New Mexico, Up to 50{\%} of the annual
rainfall of Arizona and New Mexico occurs as
monsoonal storms from July through
September. Instrumental measurement of temperature
and precipitation in the Southwest dates back to the
middle to late 1800s, From that record, average
annual rainfall of Arizona is 322 mm (12.7"), while
that of New Mexico is 340 nun (13.4"), and mean
annual temperature of New Mexico is cooler
(12degreesC [53degreesF]) than Arizona (17degreesC
[62degreesF]). As instrumental meteorological
records extend back only about 100 to 120 yr
throughout the Southwest, they are of limited
utility for studying climate phenomena of long time
frames. Hence, there is a need to extend the
measured meteorological record further back in time
using so-called 'natural archive' pal eo climate
records. Tree-ring data, which provide annual
resolution, range throughout the Southwest, extend
back in time for up to 1000 yr or more in various
forests of the Southwest, and integrate well the
influences of both temperature and precipitation,
are useful for this assessment of climate of the
Southwest. Tree growth of mid-elevation forests
typically responds to moisture availability during
the growing season, and a commonly used climate
variable in paleo-precipitation studies is the
Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which is a
single variable derived from variation in
precipitation and temperature. June-August PDSI
strongly represents precipitation and, to a lesser
extent, temperature of the year prior to the growing
season (prior September through current August), The
maximum intra-ring density of higher elevation trees
can yield a useful record of summer temperature
variation. The combined paleo-modern climate record
has at least 3 occurrences of multi-decadal
variation (50 to 80 yr) of alternating dry (below
average PDSI) to wet (above average PDSI). The
amplitude of this variation has increased since the
1700s. The most obvious feature of Because this
warming trend is outside the variation of the
natural archives, it is possible that anthropogenic
impacts, such as increased atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse trace gases, are
playing a role in climate of the Southwest,
Accordingly, this pattern merits further research in
search of its cause or combination of causes.},

robustness of these patterns over time using
tree-ring-based drought reconstructions have been

precipitation anomalies in North America are related
to changes in the paths of storm systems across the
Pacific Ocean, with a more southern route into
southwestern North America during El Ninos and a
more northern route into the Pacific Northwest
during La Ninas. Daily reanalysis data are analyzed
to confirm these changes. Seasonal mean upper
tropospheric eddy statistics show, for El Ninos (La
Ninas), a pattern that is shifted southward
(northward) compared with climatology. Paths of
coherent phase propagation of transient eddies and
of the propagation of wave packets are analyzed. A
coherent path of propagation across the Pacific
towards North America is identified that is more
zonal during El Nino winters and, during La Ninas,
has a dominant path heading northeastward to the
Pacific Northwest. A second path heading
southeastward from the central Pacific to the
tropical east Pacific is more accentuated during La
Ninas than El Ninos. These changes in wave
propagation are reproduced in an ensemble of
seasonal integrations of a general circulation model
forced by a tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature
pattern, confirming that the changes are forced by
changes in the mean atmospheric state arising from
changes in tropical sea-surface temperature. A
simplified model with a specified basic state is
used to model the storm tracks for El Nino and La

Accurate retrieval of ice concentrations from these data is important because of the sensitivity of surface flux (e.g., heat, salt, and water) calculations to small changes in the amount of open water (leads and polynyas) within the polar ice packs. Two algorithms that have been used for deriving ice concentrations from multichannel data are compared. One is the NASA Team algorithm and the other is the Bootstrap algorithm, both of which were developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The two algorithms use different channel combinations, reference brightness temperatures, weather filters, and techniques. Analyses are made to evaluate the sensitivity of algorithm results to variations of emissivity and temperature with space and time. To assess the difference in the performance of the two algorithms, analyses were performed with data from both hemispheres and for all seasons. The results show only small differences in the central Arctic in winter but larger disagreements in the seasonal regions and in summer. In some areas in the Antarctic, the Bootstrap technique shows ice concentrations higher than those of the Team algorithm by as much as 25{\%}; whereas, in other areas, it shows ice concentrations lower by as much as 30{\%}. The differences in the results are caused by temperature effects, emissivity effects, and tie point differences. The Team and the Bootstrap results were compared with available Landsat, advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. AVHRR, Landsat, and SAR data sets all yield higher concentrations than the passive microwave algorithms. Inconsistencies among results suggest the need for further validation studies.},

Since the end of the twentieth century, global mean surface temperature has not risen as rapidly as predicted by global climate models1,2,3 (GCMs). This discrepancy has become known as the global warming ‘hiatus' and a variety of mechanisms1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 have been proposed to explain the observed slowdown in warming. Focusing on internally generated variability, we use pre-industrial control simulations from an observationally constrained ensemble of GCMs and a statistical approach to evaluate the expected frequency and characteristics of variability-driven hiatus periods and their likelihood of future continuation. Given an expected forced warming trend of ∼0.2 K per decade, our constrained ensemble of GCMs implies that the probability of a variability-driven 10-year hiatus is ∼10{\%}, but less than 1{\%} for a 20-year hiatus. Although the absolute probability of a 20-year hiatus is small, the probability that an existing 15-year hiatus will continue another five years is much higher (up to 25{\%}). Therefore, given the recognized contribution of internal climate variability to the reduced rate of global warming during the past 15 years, we should not be surprised if the current hiatus continues until the end of the decade. Following the termination of a variability-driven hiatus, we also show that there is an increased likelihood of accelerated global warming associated with release of heat from the sub-surface ocean and a reversal of the phase of decadal variability in the Pacific Ocean.},

Pacific has implications for climate both locally
and over North America. A crucial question is the
degree to which this variability arises from coupled
ocean/atmosphere interactions over the North Pacific
that involve ocean dynamics, as opposed to either
purely thermodynamic effects of the oceanic mixed
layer integrating in situ the stochastic atmospheric
forcing, or the teleconnected response to tropical
variability. The part of the variability that is
coming from local coupled ocean/atmosphere
interactions involving ocean dynamics is potentially
predictable by an ocean/atmosphere general
circulation model (O/A GCM), and such predictions
could (depending on the achievable lead time) have
distinct societal benefits. This question is
examined using the results of fully coupled O/A
GCMs, as well as targeted numerical experiments with
stand-alone ocean and atmosphere models
individually. It is found that coupled
ocean/atmosphere interactions that involve ocean
dynamics are important to determining the strength
and frequency of a decadal-time scale peak in the
spectra of several oceanic variables in the Kuroshio
extension region off Japan. Local stochastic
atmospheric heat nux forcing, integrated by the
oceanic mixed layer into a red spectrum, provides a
noise background from which the signal must be
extracted. Although teleconnected ENSO responses
influence the North Pacific in the 2-7 years/cycle
frequency band, it is shown that some decadal-time
scale processes in the North Pacific proceed without

abstract = {In the Pacific Ocean, the coherent pattern of
interdecadal variations in sea surface temperature
(SST) over the last similar to100 years has been
termed the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation
(IPO). To examine past variations in the IPO we have
generated time series of Sr/Ca and oxygen isotopes
(delta(18)O) from South Pacific Porites coral
colonies growing at Rarotonga (1997 to 1726) and
Fiji (1997 to 1780). At both sites skeletal Sr/Ca is
highly correlated with instrumental SST at least
back to similar to1970 and delta(18)O appears to
reflect both SST and South Pacific Convergence Zone
(SPCZ) effects on seawater delta(18)O. Comparison of
our results to a New Caledonia coral delta(18)O
record and to indices of interdecadal Pacific
climate variability demonstrates that these South
Pacific corals have accurately recorded twentieth
century variations in the IPO and SPCZ. The coral
records also indicate that higher amplitude and more
spatially coherent IPO-related variability existed
from 1880 to 1950 with notably poor between-site
correlations in the mid-1800s. These observations
suggest that the spatial IPO pattern in South
Pacific SST was significantly more complex and/or
poorly defined in the mid-1800s compared to that
observed in the twentieth century. Comparison with
North Pacific IPO indices also indicates that the
degree of cross-hemispheric symmetry of interdecadal
oceanographic variability has changed over time with
a lower correlation between the North and South
Pacific in the mid-1800s. This evidence suggests
that the spatial pattern of the IPO at least in the
South Pacific has varied over the last 300 years,
with a major reorganization occurring after similar
to1880 A.D.},

abstract = {The time at which the signal of climate change emerges from the noise of natural climate variability (Time of Emergence, ToE) is a key variable for climate predictions and risk assessments. Here we present a methodology for estimating ToE for individual climate models, and use it to make maps of ToE for surface air temperature (SAT) based on the CMIP3 global climate models. Consistent with previous studies we show that the median ToE occurs several decades sooner in low latitudes, particularly in boreal summer, than in mid-latitudes. We also show that the median ToE in the Arctic occurs sooner in boreal winter than in boreal summer. A key new aspect of our study is that we quantify the uncertainty in ToE that arises not only from inter-model differences in the magnitude of the climate change signal, but also from large differences in the simulation of natural climate variability. The uncertainty in ToE is at least 30 years in the regions examined, and as much as 60 years in some regions. Alternative emissions scenarios lead to changes in both the median ToE (by a decade or more) and its uncertainty. The SRES B1 scenario is associated with a very large uncertainty in ToE in some regions. Our findings have important implications for climate modelling and climate policy which we discuss.

Conscious that the impacts of heatwaves can span large differences in spatial and temporal scales, we focus on two measures of the extreme Siberian heat of 2020: January to June mean temperatures over a large Siberian region and maximum daily temperatures in the vicinity of the town of Verkhoyansk. We show that human-induced climate change has dramatically increased the probability of occurrence and magnitude of extremes in both of these (with lower confidence for the probability for Verkhoyansk) and that without human influence the temperatures widely experienced in Siberia in the first half of 2020 would have been practically impossible.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

U.S. Great Plains, due to its significance in national food production, evident climate variability, and extensive irrigation is an ideal region of investigation for climate impacts on food production. This paper evaluates climate impacts on maize, sorghum, and soybean yields and effect of irrigation for individual counties in this region by employing extensive crop yield and climate datasets from 1968-2013. Variability in crop yields was a quarter of the regional average yields, with a quarter of this variability explained by climate variability, and temperature and precipitation explained these in singularity or combination at different locations. Observed temperature trend was beneficial for maize yields, but detrimental for sorghum and soybean yields, whereas observed precipitation trend was beneficial for all three crops. Irrigated yields demonstrated increased robustness and an effective mitigation strategy against climate impacts than their non-irrigated counterparts by a considerable fraction. The information, data, and maps provided can serve as an assessment guide for planners, managers, and policy- and decision makers to prioritize agricultural resilience efforts and resource allocation or re-allocation in the regions that exhibit risk from climate variability.},

Aside from the warming trend itself, this has broader implications, e.g. atmospheric circulation trends depend on latitudinal temperature gradients. In this study, tropical temperature trends in the CMIP6 models are examined, from 1979 to 2014, and contrasted with trends from the RICH/RAOBCORE radiosondes, and the ERA5/5.1 reanalysis. As in earlier studies, we find considerable warming biases in the CMIP6 modeled trends, and we show that these biases are linked to biases in surface temperature. We also uncover previously undocumented biases in the lower-middle stratosphere: the CMIP6 models appear unable to capture the time evolution of stratospheric cooling, which is non-monotonic owing to the Montreal Protocol. Finally, using models with large ensembles, we show that their standard deviation in tropospheric temperature trends, which is due to internal variability alone, explains ∼ 50{\%} (± 20{\%}) of that from the CMIP6 models.},

More specifically, satellite passive-microwave data for the period November 1978–December 2010 reveal an overall positive trend in ice extents of 17 100 {\&}plusmn; 2300 km2 yr−1. Much of the increase, at 13 700 {\&}plusmn; 1500 km2 yr−1, has occurred in the region of the Ross Sea, with lesser contributions from the Weddell Sea and Indian Ocean. One region, that of the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas, has (like the Arctic) instead experienced significant sea ice decreases, with an overall ice extent trend of −8200 {\&}plusmn; 1200 km2 yr−1. When examined through the annual cycle over the 32-yr period 1979–2010, the Southern Hemisphere sea ice cover as a whole experienced positive ice extent trends in every month, ranging in magnitude from a low of 9100 {\&}plusmn; 6300 km2 yr−1 in February to a high of 24 700 {\&}plusmn; 10 000 km2 yr−1 in May. The Ross Sea and Indian Ocean also had positive trends in each month, while the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas had negative trends in each month, and the Weddell Sea and western Pacific Ocean had a mixture of positive and negative trends. Comparing ice-area results to ice-extent results, in each case the ice-area trend has the same sign as the ice-extent trend, but the magnitudes of the two trends differ, and in some cases these differences allow inferences about the corresponding changes in sea ice concentrations. The strong pattern of decreasing ice coverage in the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas region and increasing ice coverage in the Ross Sea region is suggestive of changes in atmospheric circulation.

Here we show that sixteen models contributing to the Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project simulate a weakening of mid-latitude westerlies in response to projected Arctic sea ice loss. We develop an emergent constraint based on eddy feedback, which is 1.2 to 3 times too weak in the models, suggesting that the real-world weakening lies towards the higher end of the model simulations. Still, the modelled response to Arctic sea ice loss is weak: the North Atlantic Oscillation response is similar in magnitude and offsets the projected response to increased greenhouse gases, but would only account for around 10{\%} of variations in individual years. We further find that relationships between Arctic sea ice and atmospheric circulation have weakened recently in observations and are no longer inconsistent with those in models. The degree to which Arctic sea ice decline influences the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation is widely debated. Here, the authors use a coordinated multi-model experiment to show that Arctic sea ice loss causes a weakening of the mid-latitude westerly winds, but the effect is overall small.},

monsoon and widespread drought conditions due to
anomalous subsidence associated with a shift in the

co-occur with positive IOD (pIOD) events, Indian

drought-inducing subsidence by enhancing moisture
convergence over the Indian subcontinent, with an
average monsoon season resulting. Decadal

forced. Comparison between 20th century runs and

reflective aerosols: they force a gradient in SST

abstract = {Flowering times are well-documented indicators of the ecological effects of climate change and are linked to numerous ecosystem processes and trophic interactions. Dozens of studies have shown that flowering times for many spring-flowering plants have become earlier as a result of recent climate change, but it is uncertain if flowering times will continue to advance as temperatures rise. Here, we used long-term flowering records initiated by Henry David Thoreau in 1852 and Aldo Leopold in 1935 to investigate this question. Our analyses demonstrate that record-breaking spring temperatures in 2010 and 2012 in Massachusetts, USA, and 2012 in Wisconsin, USA, resulted in the earliest flowering times in recorded history for dozens of spring-flowering plants of the eastern United States. These dramatic advances in spring flowering were successfully predicted by historical relationships between flowering and spring temperature spanning up to 161 years of ecological change. These results demonstrate that numerous temperate plant species have yet to show obvious signs of physiological constraints on phenological advancement in the face of climate change.},

abstract = {Satellite observations show that the Arctic sea ice melt season is getting longer. This lengthening has important implications for the Arctic Ocean's radiation budget, marine ecology and accessibility. Here we assess how passive microwave satellite observations of the melt season can be used for climate model evaluation. By using the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM LE), we evaluate the effect of multiple possible definitions of melt onset, freeze onset and melt season length on comparisons with passive microwave satellite data, while taking into account the impacts of internal variability. We find that within the CESM LE, melt onset shows a higher sensitivity to definition choices than freeze onset, while freeze onset is more greatly impacted by internal variability. The CESM LE accurately simulates that the trend in freeze onset largely drives the observed pan-Arctic trend in melt season length. Under RCP8.5 forcing, the CESM LE projects that freeze onset dates will continue to shift later, leading to a pan-Arctic average melt season length of 7-9 months by the end of the 21st century. However, none of the available model definitions produce trends in the pan-Arctic melt season length as large as seen in passive microwave observations. This suggests a model bias, which might be a factor in the generally underestimated response of sea ice loss to global warming in the CESM LE. Overall, our results show that the choice of model melt season definition is highly dependent on the question posed, and none of the definitions exactly match the physics underlying the passive microwave observations.},

Severity Indices (PDSI) are used to identify decadal
droughts more severe and prolonged than any

"megadroughts" are identified at two spatial scales,
the North American continental scale (exclusive of
Alaska and boreal Canada) and at the sub-continental
scale over western North America. Intense decadal
droughts have had significant environmental and
socioeconomic impacts, as is illustrated with
historical information. Only one prolonged
continent-wide megadrought during the past 500 years
exceeded the decadal droughts witnessed during the

over the western sector of North America from
A.D. 1300 to 1900. The early 20th century pluvial

continental or sub-continental scale during the past
500 to 700 years. The decadal droughts of the 20th
century, and the reconstructed megadroughts during
the six previous centuries, all covered large
sectors of western North America and in some cases
extended into the eastern United States. All of
these persistent decadal droughts included shorter
duration cells of regional drought (sub-decadal
approximate to 6 years), most of which resemble the
regional patterns of drought identified with monthly

well-known regional drought patterns are also
characterized by unique monthly precipitation
climatologies. Intense sub-decadal drought shifted
among these drought regions during the modern and
reconstructed multi-year droughts, which prolonged
large-scale drought and resulted in the regimes of
megadrought.},

However, the question remains as to what is an optimal sea ice concentration retrieval method for climate monitoring. This paper presents some of the key results of an extensive algorithm inter-comparison and evaluation experiment. The skills of 30 sea ice algorithms were evaluated systematically over low and high sea ice concentrations. Evaluation criteria included standard deviation relative to independent validation data, performance in the presence of thin ice and melt ponds, and sensitivity to error sources with seasonal to inter-annual variations and potential climatic trends, such as atmospheric water vapour and water-surface roughening by wind. A selection of 13 algorithms is shown in the article to demonstrate the results. Based on the findings, a hybrid approach is suggested to retrieve sea ice concentration globally for climate monitoring purposes. This approach consists of a combination of two algorithms plus dynamic tie points implementation and atmospheric correction of input brightness temperatures. The method minimizes inter-sensor calibration discrepancies and sensitivity to the mentioned error sources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Under the influence of global warming, the mean climate of the Pacific region will probably undergo significant changes. The tropical easterly trade winds are expected to weaken; surface ocean temperatures are expected to warm fastest near the equator and more slowly farther away; the equatorial thermocline that marks the transition between the wind-mixed upper ocean and deeper layers is expected to shoal; and the temperature gradients across the thermocline are expected to become steeper. Year-to-year ENSO variability is controlled by a delicate balance of amplifying and damping feedbacks, and one or more of the physical processes that are responsible for determining the characteristics of ENSO will probably be modified by climate change. Therefore, despite considerable progress in our understanding of the impact of climate change on many of the processes that contribute to El Ni{\~{n}}o variability, it is not yet possible to say whether ENSO activity will be enhanced or damped, or if the frequency of events will change.},

stimulated luminescence and C-14 ages from nearby
terraced aggradational alluvial deposits indicate a
paucity of large floods in the Late Pleistocene and
at least five large flood events in the last c. 6
kyr, interpreted to mark an increased frequency of
extreme rainfall events in the middle Holocene
despite overall reduced EP. Increased EP in
south-central Australia during the early to middle
Holocene resulted from (1) decreased El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability, which
reduced the frequency of El Nino-triggered droughts,
(2) the prevalence of a more La Nina-like mean
climatic state in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which
increased available atmospheric moisture, and (3) a
southward shift in the Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ICTZ), which allowed tropical summer storms
associated with the Australian summer monsoon (ASM)
to penetrate deeper into the southern part of the
continent. The onset of heightened aridity and
apparent increase in large flood frequency at c. 5
ka is interpreted to indicate the establishment of
an ENSO-like climate in arid Australia in the late
Holocene, consistent with a variety of other
terrestrial and marine proxies. The broad
synchroneity of Holocene climate change across much
of the Australian continent with changes in ENSO
behavior suggests strong teleconnections amongst
ENSO and the other climate systems such as the ASM,

In the other perspective, we investigate how the hiatus relates to changes in energy fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and to the three-dimensional distribution of ocean heat content change on decadal timescales. We find that the recent surface warming hiatus is associated with a transition of the IPO from a positive to negative phase and with heat redistribution between the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. The AMO has shifted to a positive phase since the late 1990s, inducing a La Ni{\~{n}}a-type response over the tropical Pacific via a tropic-wide teleconnection, contributing to the global warming hiatus.},

A proposed mechanism for IPO multidecadal variability indicates that the presence of decadal timescale upper ocean heat content in the off-equatorial western tropical Pacific can provide conditions for an interannual El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation event to trigger a transition of tropical Pacific SSTs to the opposite IPO phase. Here we show that a decadal prediction initialized in 2013 simulates predicted Ni{\~{n}}o3.4 SSTs that have qualitatively tracked the observations through 2015. The year three to seven average prediction (2015–2019) from the 2013 initial state shows a transition to the positive phase of the IPO from the previous negative phase and a resumption of larger rates of global warming over the 2013–2022 period consistent with a positive IPO phase. The phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) impacts global temperatures. Here, the authors show that a build-up of off-equatorial western tropical Pacific heat content allows ENSO events to trigger IPO phase changes, with a predicted switch to a positive IPO for 2015–2019 and larger warming trends.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}![CDATA[Abstract. The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is quasi-periodic oscillation of the tropical zonal wind in the stratosphere. When the tropical lower stratospheric wind is easterly (westerly), the winter Northern Hemisphere (NH) stratospheric polar vortex tends to be weak (strong). This relation is known as the Holton–Tan relationship. Several mechanisms for this relationship have been proposed, especially linking the tropics with high latitudes through stratospheric pathway. Although QBO impacts on the troposphere have been extensively discussed, a tropospheric pathway of the Holton–Tan relationship has not been explored previously. Here, we propose a tropospheric pathway of the QBO impact, which may partly account for the Holton–Tan relationship in early winter, especially in the November–December period. The study is based on analyses of observational data and results from a simple linear model and atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations. The mechanism is summarized as follows: the easterly phase of the QBO is accompanied with colder temperature in the tropical tropopause layer, which enhances convective activity over the tropical western Pacific and suppresses it over the Indian Ocean, thus enhancing the Walker circulation. This convection anomaly generates a Rossby wave train, propagating into the midlatitude troposphere, which constructively interferences with the climatological stationary waves, especially in wavenumber 1, resulting in enhanced upward propagation of the planetary wave and a weakened polar vortex.]]{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Atmospheric chemistry is one of the fastest growing fields in the earth sciences. Until now, however, there has been no book designed to help students capture the essence of the subject in a brief course of study. Daniel Jacob, a leading researcher and teacher in the field, addresses that problem by presenting the first textbook on atmospheric chemistry for a one-semester course. Based on the approach he developed in his class at Harvard, Jacob introduces students in clear and concise chapters to the fundamentals as well as the latest ideas and findings in the field. Jacob's aim is to show students how to use basic principles of physics and chemistry to describe a complex system such as the atmosphere. He also seeks to give students an overview of the current state of research and the work that led to this point. Jacob begins with atmospheric structure, design of simple models, atmospheric transport, and the continuity equation, and continues with geochemical cycles, the greenhouse effect, aerosols, stratospheric ozone, the oxidizing power of the atmosphere, smog, and acid rain. Each chapter concludes with a problem set based on recent scientific literature. This is a novel approach to problem-set writing, and one that successfully introduces students to the prevailing issues. This is a major contribution to a growing area of study and will be welcomed enthusiastically by students and teachers alike.},

abstract = {Influence of low Arctic sea-ice minima in early autumn on the wintertime climate over Eurasia is investigated. Observational evidence shows that significant cold anomalies over the Far East in early winter and zonally elongated cold anomalies from Europe to Far East in late winter are associated with the decrease of the Arctic sea-ice cover in the preceding summer-to-autumn seasons. Results from numerical experiments using an atmospheric general circulation model support these notions. The remote response in early winter is regarded as a stationary Rossby wave generated thermally through an anomalous turbulent heat fluxes as a result of anomalous ice-cover over the Barents-Kara Seas in late autumn, which tends to induce an amplification of the Siberian high causing colder conditions over the Far East. The late-winter cold anomalies over Eurasia are also reproduced in our experiment, which is associated with the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation.

In generating the ensemble members, perturbations are added to the atmospheric initial state only. The skill of the prediction system is analyzed from both a deterministic and a probabilistic perspective, it is then compared to the operational NOAA Climate Forecast System (CFS), and the forecasts are combined with CFS to produce a multimodel prediction system. While the skill scores for each model are highly dependent on lead time and initialization month, the overall level of skill of the individual models is quite comparable. The multimodel combination (i.e., the unweighted average of the forecast), while not always the most skillful, is generally as skillful as the best model, using either deterministic or probabilistic skill metrics.},

The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach, coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning. Complex Earth system challenges can be addressed by incorporating spatial and temporal context into machine learning, especially via deep learning, and further by combining with physical models into hybrid models.},

abstract = {The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project is an international effort to produce a comprehensive global atmospheric circulation dataset spanning the twentieth century, assimilating only surface pressure reports and using observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as boundary conditions. It is chiefly motivated by a need to provide an observational dataset with quantified uncertainties for validations of climate model simulations of the twentieth century on all time-scales, with emphasis on the statistics of daily weather. It uses an Ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation method with background 'first guess' fields supplied by an ensemble of forecasts from a global numerical weather prediction model. This directly yields a global analysis every 6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere, and also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis. The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of global tropospheric variability, and of the dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the present at 6-hourly temporal and 2° spatial resolutions. Intercomparisons with independent radiosonde data indicate that the reanalyses are generally of high quality. The quality in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere throughout the century is similar to that of current three-day operational NWP forecasts. Intercomparisons over the second half-century of these surface-based reanalyses with other reanalyses that also make use of upper-air and satellite data are equally encouraging. It is anticipated that the 20CR dataset will be a valuable resource to the climate research community for both model validations and diagnostic studies. Some surprising results are already evident. For instance, the long-term trends of indices representing the North Atlantic Oscillation, the tropical Pacific Walker Circulation, and the Pacific-North American pattern are weak or non-existent over the full period of record. The long-term trends of zonally averaged precipitation minus evaporation also differ in character from those in climate model simulations of the twentieth century. {\textcopyright} 2011 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright.},

in Southwest North America is the concurrence of
elevated temperatures and increased
aridity. Instrumental records and paleoclimatic
evidence for past prolonged drought in the Southwest
that coincide with elevated temperatures can be
assessed to provide insights on temperature-drought
relations and to develop worst-case scenarios for
the future. In particular, during the medieval
period, similar to AD 900-1300, the Northern
Hemisphere experienced temperatures warmer than all
but the most recent decades. Paleoclimatic and model
data indicate increased temperatures in western
North America of approximately 1 degrees C over the
long-term mean. This was a period of extensive and
persistent aridity over western North
America. Paleoclimatic evidence suggests drought in
the mid-12th century far exceeded the severity,
duration, and extent of subsequent droughts. The
driest decade of this drought was anomalously warm,
though not as warm as the late 20th and early 21st
centuries. The convergence of prolonged warming and
arid conditions suggests the mid-12th century may
serve as a conservative analogue for severe droughts
that might occur in the future. The severity,
extent, and persistence of the 12th century drought
that occurred under natural climate variability,
have important implications for water resource
management. The causes of past and future drought
will not be identical but warm droughts, inferred
from paleoclimatic records, demonstrate the
plausibility of extensive, severe droughts, provide
a long-term perspective on the ongoing drought
conditions in the Southwest, and suggest the need
for regional sustainability planning for the
future.},

abstract = {The leading modes of variability of the
extratropical circulation in both hemispheres are
characterized by deep, zonally symmetric or
"annular" structures, with geopotential height
perturbations of opposing signs in the polar cap
region and in the surrounding zonal ring centered
near 45 degrees latitude. The structure and dynamics
of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode have
been extensively documented, whereas the existence
of a Northern Hemisphere (NH) mode, herein referred
to as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), has only recently
been recognized. Like the SH mode, the AO can be
defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function
of the sea level pressure field or of the zonally
symmetric geopotential height or zonal wind
fields. In this paper the; structure and seasonality
of the NH and SH modes are compared based on data
from the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research
reanalysis and supplementary datasets. The
structures of the NH and SH annular modes are shown
to be remarkably similar, not only in the zonally
averaged geopotential height and zonal wind fields,
but in the mean meridional circulations as
well. Both exist year-round in the troposphere, but
they amplify with height upward into the
stratosphere during those seasons in which the
strength of the zonal flow is conducive to strong
planetary wave-mean how interaction: midwinter in
the NH and late spring in the SH. During these
"active seasons," the annular modes modulate the
strength of the Lagrangian mean circulation in the
lower stratosphere, total column ozone and
tropopause height over mid- and high latitudes, and
the strength of the trade winds of their respective
hemispheres. The NH mode also contains an embedded
planetary wave signature with expressions in surface
air temperature, precipitation, total column ozone,
and tropopause height. It is argued that the
horizontal temperature advection by the perturbed
zonal-mean zonal wind field in the lower troposphere
is instrumental in forcing this pattern. A
companion paper documents the striking resemblance
between the structure of the annular modes and
observed climate trends over the past few decades.},

The initial adjustment of the atmospheric circulation is characterized by an out-of-phase relationship between geopotential height anomalies in the lower and upper troposphere localized to the vicinity of the forcing. This initial baroclinic response reaches a maximum amplitude in ∼5–10 days, and persists for 2–3 weeks. Diagnostic results with a linear primitive equation model indicate that this initial response is forced by diabatic heating anomalies in the lower troposphere associated with surface heat flux anomalies generated by the imposed thermal forcing.

So far, however, no methods for quantifying uncertainties of explanations have been conceived, which is problematic in domains where a high confidence in explanations is a prerequisite. We therefore contribute by proposing a new framework that allows to convert any arbitrary explanation method for neural networks into an explanation method for Bayesian neural networks, with an in-built modeling of uncertainties. Within the Bayesian framework a network's weights follow a distribution that extends standard single explanation scores and heatmaps to distributions thereof, in this manner translating the intrinsic network model uncertainties into a quantification of explanation uncertainties. This allows us for the first time to carve out uncertainties associated with a model explanation and subsequently gauge the appropriate level of explanation confidence for a user (using percentiles).

analysis of diatom-inferred salinity from a site in
the Northern Great Plains to reconstruct
multidecadal-and centennial-scale climatic patterns

salinity indicates a transition from fresh to highly
saline conditions between c. 13 400 and 7700 cal. yr
BP, which suggests a major shift in climate from wet

increasing salinity is interrupted by several
freshwater intervals between c. 9800 and 7950
cal. yr BP, which may be the result of an increase
in the frequency of monsoonal flow from the Gulf of
Mexico. The early Holocene is considered to be a
time of rapid change in climate and vegetation
within the Holocene. Although rates of change in the
Moon Lake diatom assemblages were high during parts
of the early Holocene, in general the rate of change
was as great or greater during the last two

generally directional change in climate in the early
Holocene, in contrast to shorter-term fluctuations

flowering, and leaf coloring, are closely associated

particularly sensitive to climatic factors,
especially temperature variations. Therefore, the
occurrence of specific plant events can be used to
identify the onset of spring. Advance or delay in
these timings can serve as potential climate change
detection measures over long periods. In this paper,
changes to spring's onset in Wisconsin were examined
using the first-bloom event of several introduced
and native species in t965-1998. Due to the
incompleteness of these observations, satellite data
were applied to derive 3 phenological regions across
the state. Next, average first-bloom time-series
were formed at this regional scale. Several
multi-species indices were then created based on
regional first-bloom variations. Trends toward
earlier first-bloom dates over the study period,
especially for early-spring species, were revealed
in the southwestern and central/eastern regions of
Wisconsin. Two of the most important aspects of our
study are: (1) phenology is regarded as a
multi-species problem that can be more easily
manipulated by reducing species variations to
several indices; and (2) satellite data, weather
data, and phenological observations are integrated
to create and validate phenological regions, a

abstract = {Fires have influenced atmospheric composition and climate since the rise of vascular plants, and satellite data have shown the overall global extent of fires. Our knowledge of historic fire emissions has progressively improved over the past decades due mostly to the development of new proxies and the improvement of fire models. Currently, there is a suite of proxies including sedimentary charcoal records, measurements of fire-emitted trace gases and black carbon stored in ice and firn, and visibility observations. These proxies provide opportunities to extrapolate emission estimates back in time based on satellite data starting in 1997, but each proxy has strengths and weaknesses regarding, for example, the spatial and temporal extents over which they are representative. We developed a new historic biomass burning emissions dataset starting in 1750 that merges the satellite record with several existing proxies and uses the average of six models from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP) protocol to estimate emissions when the available proxies had limited coverage. According to our approach, global biomass burning emissions were relatively constant, with 10-year averages varying between 1.8 and 2.3 PgC yr-1. Carbon emissions increased only slightly over the full time period and peaked during the 1990s after which they decreased gradually. There is substantial uncertainty in these estimates, and patterns varied depending on choices regarding data representation, especially on regional scales. The observed pattern in fire carbon emissions is for a large part driven by African fires, which accounted for 58{\%} of global fire carbon emissions. African fire emissions declined since about 1950 due to conversion of savanna to cropland, and this decrease is partially compensated for by increasing emissions in deforestation zones of South America and Asia. These global fire emission estimates are mostly suited for global analyses and will be used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations.},

abstract = {The relative influences of Indian and Pacific Ocean
modes of variability on Australian rainfall and soil
moisture are investigated for seasonal, interannual,
and decadal time scales. For the period 1900-2006,
observations, reanalysis products, and hindcasts of
soil moisture during the cool season (June October)
are used to assess the impacts of El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD)
on southeastern Australia and the Murray Darling
Basin, two regions that have recently suffered
severe droughts. A distinct asymmetry is found in
the impacts of the opposite phases of both ENSO and
IOD on Australian rainfall and soil moisture. There
are significant differences between the dominant
drivers of drought at interannual and decadal time
scales. On interannual time scales, both ENSO and
the IOD modify southeastern Australian soil
moisture, with the driest (wettest) conditions over
the southeast and more broadly over large parts of
Australia occurring during years when an El Nino and
a positive IOD event (La Nina and a negative IOD
event) co-occur. The atmospheric circulation
associated with these responses is
discussed. Lower-frequency variability over
southeastern Australia, however, including multiyear
drought periods, seems to be more robustly related
to Indian Ocean temperatures than Pacific
conditions. The frequencies of both positive and
negative IOD events are significantly different
during periods of prolonged drought compared to
extended periods of "normal" rainfall. In contrast,
the frequency of ENSO events remains largely
unchanged during prolonged dry and wet periods. For
the Murray Darling Basin, there appears to be a
significant influence by La Nina and both positive
and negative IOD events. In particular, La Nina
plays a much more prominent role than for more
southern regions, especially on interannual time
scales and during prolonged wet periods. For
prolonged dry (wet) periods, positive IOD events
also occur in unusually high (low) numbers.},

We then apply a modified version of the indirect method to 11 CMIP5 models to reveal the robust and non-robust aspects of the wintertime atmospheric response to projected Arctic sea ice loss. Despite limitations of the indirect method, we identify a robust enhancement of the Siberian High, weakening of the Icelandic Low, weakening of the westerly wind on the poleward flank of the eddy-driven jet, strengthening of the subtropical jet, and weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex.

Robust, long-lead forecasts would therefore be valuable for managing policy responses. But despite decades of effort, forecasting ENSO events at lead times of more than one year remains problematic2. Here we show that a statistical forecast model employing a deep-learning approach produces skilful ENSO forecasts for lead times of up to one and a half years. To circumvent the limited amount of observation data, we use transfer learning to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) first on historical simulations3 and subsequently on reanalysis from 1871 to 1973. During the validation period from 1984 to 2017, the all-season correlation skill of the Nino3.4 index of the CNN model is much higher than those of current state-of-the-art dynamical forecast systems. The CNN model is also better at predicting the detailed zonal distribution of sea surface temperatures, overcoming a weakness of dynamical forecast models. A heat map analysis indicates that the CNN model predicts ENSO events using physically reasonable precursors. The CNN model is thus a powerful tool for both the prediction of ENSO events and for the analysis of their associated complex mechanisms.},

The cloud scheme uses a probability distribution function (PDF) of the total water whose variance and skewness coefficient are diagnosed from the amount of condensed water produced at the subgrid scale by cumulus convection and at the large scale by supersaturation, from the degree of saturation of the environment, and from the lower bound of the total water distribution that is taken equal to zero.

abstract = {The discipline of seasonal climate prediction began as an exercise in simple statistical techniques. However, today the large government forecast centers almost exclusively rely on complex fully coupled dynamical forecast systems for their subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) predictions while statistical techniques are mostly neglected and those techniques still in use have not been updated in decades. In this Opinion Article, we argue that new statistical techniques mostly developed outside the field of climate science, collectively referred to as machine learning, can be adopted by climate forecasters to increase the accuracy of S2S predictions. We present an example of where unsupervised learning demonstrates higher accuracy in a seasonal prediction than the state-of-the-art dynamical systems. We also summarize some relevant machine learning methods that are most applicable to climate prediction. Finally, we show by comparing real-time dynamical model forecasts with observations from winter 2017/2018 that dynamical model forecasts are almost entirely insensitive to polar vortex (PV) variability and the impact on sensible weather. Instead, statistical forecasts more accurately predicted the resultant sensible weather from a mid-winter PV disruption than the dynamical forecasts. The important implication from the poor dynamical forecasts is that if Arctic change influences mid-latitude weather through PV variability, then the ability of dynamical models to demonstrate the existence of such a pathway is compromised. We conclude by suggesting that S2S prediction will be most beneficial to the public by incorporating mixed or a hybrid of dynamical forecasts and updated statistical techniques such as machine learning.

abstract = {Globally averaged surface air temperatures in some decades show rapid increases (accelerated warming decades), and in other decades there is no warming trend (hiatus decades). A previous study showed that the net energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere of about 1Wm22 is associated with greater increases of deep ocean heat content below 750m during the hiatus decades, while there is little globally averaged surface temperature increase or warming in the upper ocean layers. Here the authors examine processes involved with accelerated warming decades and address the relative roles of external forcing from increasing greenhouse gases and internally generated decadal climate variability associated with interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO). Model results from the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), show that accelerated warming decades are characterized by rapid warming of globally averaged surface air temperature, greater increases of heat content in the upper ocean layers, and less heat content increase in the deep ocean, opposite to the hiatus decades. In addition to contributions from processes potentially linked to Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), the positive phase of the IPO, adding to the response to external forcing, is usually associated with accelerated warming decades. Conversely, hiatus decades typically occur with the negative phase of the IPO, when warming from the external forcing is overwhelmed by internally generated cooling in the tropical Pacific. Internally generated hiatus periods of up to 15 years with zero global warming trend are present in the future climate simulations. This suggests that there is a chance that the current observed hiatus could extend for several more years. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Warming in the Arctic has been much faster than the rest of the world in both observations and model simulations, a phenomenon known as the Arctic amplification (AA) whose cause is still under debate. By analyzing data and model simulations, here we show that large AA occurs only from October to April and only over areas with significant sea-ice loss. AA largely disappears when Arctic sea ice is fixed or melts away. Periods with larger AA are associated with larger sea-ice loss, and models with bigger sea-ice loss produce larger AA. Increased outgoing longwave radiation and heat fluxes from the newly opened waters cause AA, whereas all other processes can only indirectly contribute to AA by melting sea-ice. We conclude that sea-ice loss is necessary for the existence of large AA and that models need to simulate Arctic sea ice realistically in order to correctly simulate Arctic warming under increasing CO 2 .},

The method combines the advantages of both types of data: the ground truth of in situ data and the improved coverage of satellite data. The technique also effectively eliminates most of the bias differences between the in situ and satellite data. Examples of the method are shown to illustrate these points. Sea surface temperature (SST) data from quality-controlled drifting buoys are used to develop error statistics for a 24-month period from January 1985 through December 1986. The average rms monthly error is 0.78°C; the modulus of the monthly blasts (i.e., the average of the absolute value of the monthly biases) is 0.09°C.},

abstract = {Abstract We assess evidence relevant to Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity per doubling of atmospheric CO2, characterized by an effective sensitivity S. This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2 K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5 K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density (PDF) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult-to-quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66{\%} range is 2.6-3.9 K for our Baseline calculation, and remains within 2.3-4.5 K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5-95{\%} ranges are 2.3-4.7 K, bounded by 2.0-5.7 K (although such high-confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent, and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S, in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing-feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.},

State of the art climate prediction uses Earth system models (ESMs), driven by systems of differential equations representing the laws of physics. Previously, these models have tended to underestimate Arctic sea ice loss. The issue is grave because accurate modeling is critical for economic, ecological, and geopolitical planning. We use machine learning techniques, including random forest regression and Gini importance, to show that the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) relies too heavily on just one of the ten chosen climatological quantities to predict September sea ice averages. Furthermore, E3SM gives too much importance to six of those quantities when compared to observed data. Identifying the features that climate models incorrectly rely on should allow climatologists to improve prediction accuracy.},

response of transient eddies to increased
atmospheric stability that allows more moisture to
converge on the windward side of the mountains by
blocking. As a result, RCMs simulate enhanced
transient eddy moisture convergence in the SW
compared to GCMs, although both robustly simulate
drying due to enhanced moisture divergence by the
divergent mean flow in a warmer climate. This
enhanced convergence leads to reduced susceptibility
to hydrological change in the RCMs compared to

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Sea ice thickness is a fundamental climate state variable that provides an integrated measure of changes in the high-latitude energy balance. However, observations of mean ice thickness have been sparse in time and space, making the construction of observation-based time series difficult. Moreover, different groups use a variety of methods and processing procedures to measure ice thickness, and each observational source likely has different and poorly characterized measurement and sampling errors. Observational sources used in this study include upward-looking sonars mounted on submarines or moorings, electromagnetic sensors on helicopters or aircraft, and lidar or radar altimeters on airplanes or satellites. Here we use a curve-fitting approach to determine the large-scale spatial and temporal variability of the ice thickness as well as the mean differences between the observation systems, using over 3000 estimates of the ice thickness. The thickness estimates are measured over spatial scales of approximately 50 km or time scales of 1 month, and the primary time period analyzed is 2000–2012 when the modern mix of observations is available. Good agreement is found between five of the systems, within 0.15 m, while systematic differences of up to 0.5 m are found for three others compared to the five.

Other important contributors include changes in ocean heat content (OHC) and precipitable water (PW). The temporal evolution of individual contributing terms is documented. The magnitude of peak GMSL anomalies associated with ENSO generally are of the order of 0.5 mm{\textperiodcentered}K−1 with significant inter-event variability, with a standard deviation ($\sigma$) that is about half as large The results underscore the exceptional rarity of the 2010/2011 La Ni{\~{n}}a-related GMSL drop and estimate the frequency of such an event to be about only once in every 75 years. In addition to ENSO, major volcanic eruptions are found to be a key driver of interannual variability. Associated GMSL variability contrasts with that of ENSO as TWS and PW anomalies initially offset the drop due to OHC reductions but short-lived relative to them.

Here we assess the effect of current INDCs on reducing aggregate greenhouse gas emissions, its implications for achieving the temperature objective of the Paris climate agreement, and potential options for overachievement. The INDCs collectively lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to where current policies stand, but still imply a median warming of 2.6-3.1 degrees Celsius by 2100. More can be achieved, because the agreement stipulates that targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are strengthened over time, both in ambition and scope.

abstract = {The strong trends in climate change already evident,
the likelihood of further changes occurring, and the
increasing scale of potential climate impacts give
urgency to addressing agricultural adaptation more
coherently. There are many potential adaptation
options available for marginal change of existing
agricultural systems, often variations of existing
climate risk management. We show that implementation
of these options is likely to have substantial
benefits under moderate climate change for some
cropping systems. However, there are limits to their
effectiveness under more severe climate
changes. Hence, more systemic changes in resource
allocation need to be considered, such as targeted
diversification of production systems and
livelihoods. We argue that achieving increased
adaptation action will necessitate integration of
climate change-related issues with other risk
factors, such as climate variability and market
risk, and with other policy domains, such as
sustainable development. Dealing with the many
barriers to effective adaptation will require a
comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a
range of scales and issues, for example, from the
understanding by farmers of change in risk profiles
to the establishment of efficient markets that
facilitate response strategies. Science, too, has to
adapt. Multidisciplinary problems require
multidisciplinary solutions, i.e., a focus on
integrated rather than disciplinary science and a
strengthening of the interface with decision
makers. A crucial component of this approach is the
implementation of adaptation assessment frameworks
that are relevant, robust, and easily operated by
all stakeholders, practitioners, policymakers, and

length, severity, and origin of drought before the

geochemical evidence from the sediments of Lake
Bosumtwi, Ghana, to reconstruct natural variability
in the African monsoon over the past three
millennia. We find that intervals of severe drought
lasting for periods ranging from decades to
centuries are characteristic of the monsoon and are
linked to natural variations in Atlantic
temperatures. Thus the severe drought of recent
decades is not anomalous in the context of the past
three millennia, indicating that the monsoon is
capable of longer and more severe future droughts.},

The CNN correctly identifies 91{\%} of observed precipitation extremes based on daily sea level pressure and 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies. There is evidence of increasing frequency of extreme precipitation circulation patterns (EPCPs) over the past two decades, although frequency changes are insignificant over the past four decades. Additionally, we find that moisture transport and precipitation intensity during EPCPs have increased. Our approach, which uses deep learning visualization to understand how the CNN predicts EPCPs, advances machine learning as a tool for providing insight into physical causes of changing extremes, potentially reducing uncertainty in future projections.},

The response of Arctic sea ice to these atmospheric changes has been studied with a thickness distribution sea-ice model coupled to an ocean model. During a period of high NAO, 1989–96, the model shows a substantial reduction of ice advection into the eastern Arctic from the Canada Basin, and an increase of ice export through Fram Strait, both of which tend to deplete thick ice in the eastern Arctic Ocean and enhance it in the western Arctic, in an uneven dipolar pattern we call the East–West Arctic Anomaly Pattern (EWAAP). From the period 1979–88 with a lower-NAO index to the period 1988–96 with a high-NAO index, the simulated ice volume in the eastern Arctic drops by about a quarter, while that in the western Arctic increases by ...},

abstract = {Recent observations and modelling studies suggest that the Arctic climate is undergoing important transition. One manifestation of this change is seen in the rapid sea-ice cover decrease as experienced in 2007 and 2012. Although most numerical climate models cannot adequately reproduce the recent changes, some models produce similar Rapid Ice Loss Events (RILEs) during the mid-21st-century. This study presents an analysis of four specific RILEs clustered around 2040 in three transient climate projections performed with the coupled Rossby Centre regional Atmosphere-Ocean model (RCAO). The analysis shows that long-term thinning causes increased vulnerability of the Arctic Ocean sea-ice cover. In the Atlantic sector, pre-conditioning (thinning of sea ice) combined with anomalous atmospheric and oceanic heat transport causes large ice loss, while in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean sea-ice albedo feedback appears important, particularly along the retreating sea-ice margin. Although maximum sea-ice loss occurs in the autumn, response in surface air temperature occurs in early winter, caused by strong increase in ocean-atmosphere surface energy fluxes, mainly the turbulent fluxes. Synchronicity of the events around 2040 in the projections is caused by a strong large-scale atmospheric circulation anomaly at the Atlantic lateral boundary of the regional model. The limited impact on land is caused by vertical propagation of the surface heat anomaly rather than horizontal, caused by the absence of low-level temperature inversion over the ocean. {\textcopyright} 2013 J.-P.

anomalies from 1955 to 1999. Each signal has warm
SST anomalies propagating slowly eastward along the
equator, generating westerly ZSW anomalies in their
wake. These westerly ZSW anomalies produce cyclonic
WSC anomalies off the equator which pump baroclinic
Rossby waves in the western/central tropical North
Pacific Ocean. These Rossby waves propagate
westward, taking similar to6, similar to12, and
similar to36 months to reach the western boundary
near similar to7degreesN, similar to12degreesN, and
similar to18degreesN on biennial, interannual, and
decadal period scales, respectively. There, they
reflect as equatorial coupled waves, propagating
slowly eastward in covarying SST, Z18, and ZSW
anomalies, taking similar to6, similar to12, and
similar to24 months to reach the central/eastern
equatorial ocean. These equatorial coupled waves
produce a delayed-negative feedback to the warm SST
anomalies there. The decrease in Rossby wave phase
speed with latitude, the increase in meridional
scale of equatorial SST anomalies with period scale,
and the associated increase in latitude of Rossby
wave forcing are consistent with the delayed action
oscillator (DAO) model used to explain El
Nino. However, this is not true of the
western-boundary reflection of Rossby waves into
slow equatorial coupled waves. This requires
modification of the extant DAO model. We construct a
modified DAO model, demonstrating how the various

the number of sunspot groups observed, rather than

observations from 117 observers active before 1874

solar activity on 111 358 days for 1610-1995,
compared to 66 168 days for the Wolf Sunspot
Numbers. The Group Sunspot Numbers also have
estimates of their random and systematic errors
tabulated. The generation and preliminary analysis
of the Group Sunspot Numbers allow us to make
several conclusions: (1) Solar activity before 1882
is lower than generally assumed and consequently
solar activity in the last few decades is higher
than it has been for several centuries. (2) There
was a solar activity peak in 1801 and not 1805 so
there is no long anomalous cycle of 17 years as
reported in the Wolf Sunspot Numbers. The longest
cycle now lasts no more than 15 years. (3) The Wolf
Sunspot Numbers have many inhomogeneities in them
arising from observer noise and this noise affects
the daily, monthly, and yearly means. The Group
Sunspot Numbers also have observer noise, but it is
considerably less than the noise in the Wolf Sunspot

Nutrients fuel the growth of phytoplankton, the base of a very productive coastal marine ecosystem [Pauly D, Christensen V (1995) Nature 374:255-257]. Because nutrient supply and phytoplankton biomass in shelf waters are highly sensitive to variation in upwelling-driven circulation, shifts in the timing and strength of upwelling may alter basic nutrient and carbon fluxes through marine food webs. We show how a 1-month delay in the 2005 spring transition to upwelling-favorable wind stress in the northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem resulted in numerous anomalies: warm water, low nutrient levels, low primary productivity, and an unprecedented low recruitment of rocky intertidal organisms. The delay was associated with 20- to 40-day wind oscillations accompanying a southward shift of the jet stream. Early in the upwelling season (May-July) off Oregon, the cumulative upwelling-favorable wind stress was the lowest in 20 years, nearshore surface waters averaged 2 degrees C warmer than normal, surf-zone chlorophyll-a and nutrients were 50{\%} and 30{\%} less than normal, respectively, and densities of recruits of mussels and barnacles were reduced by 83{\%} and 66{\%}, respectively.

abstract = {Mechanisms for El Nino-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO)-like decadal (7-35 years) variability are
analyzed using observational data. When a decadal
positive temperature anomaly occurs in the eastern
tropical Pacific, the atmospheric response excites
negative wind stress curl in the western tropical
South Pacific, which causes the thermocline to shoal
and induce a negative temperature anomaly there. The
cold anomaly moves northwestward to the western and
central equatorial region and then turns eastward
along the equator to reverse the original
temperature anomaly in the east. The eastward
propagation of the oceanic signal along the
equatorial thermocline correlates with a zonal wind
anomaly. The cold anomaly in the east grows through
tropical air-sea interaction and induces a positive
wind stress curl, in the western tropical South
Pacific associated with the atmospheric
teleconnection in the Southern
Hemisphere. Subsequent evolution of the negative
phase is similar to that of the positive phase. The
complete scenario for this ENSO-like decadal
variability due to the air-sea interaction processes
within the tropics has a period of similar to 14

abstract = {Diverse, severe, and location-specific impacts on agricultural production are anticipated with climate change. The last IPCC report indicates that the rise of CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and associated “greenhouse” gases could lead to a 1.4 to 5.8 °C increase in global surface temperatures, with subsequent consequences on precipitation frequency and amounts. Temperature and water availability remain key factors in determining crop growth and productivity; predicted changes in these factors will lead to reduced crop yields. Climate-induced changes in insect pest, pathogen and weed population dynamics and invasiveness could compound such effects. Undoubtedly, climate- and weather-induced instability will affect levels of and access to food supply, altering social and economic stability and regional competiveness. Adaptation is considered a key factor that will shape the future severity of climate change impacts on food production. Changes that will not radically modify the monoculture nature of dominant agroecosystems may moderate negative impacts temporarily. The biggest and most durable benefits will likely result from more radical agroecological measures that will strengthen the resilience of farmers and rural communities, such as diversification of agroecosytems in the form of polycultures, agroforestry systems, and crop-livestock mixed systems accompanied by organic soil management, water conservation and harvesting, and general enhancement of agrobiodiversity. Traditional farming systems are repositories of a wealth of principles and measures that can help modern agricultural systems become more resilient to climatic extremes. Many of these agroecological strategies that reduce vulnerabilities to climate variability include crop diversification, maintaining local genetic diversity, animal integration, soil organic management, water conservation and harvesting, etc. Understanding the agroecological features that underlie the resilience of traditional agroecosystems is an urgent matter, as they can serve as the foundation for the design of adapted agricultural systems. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events (hurricanes and droughts) in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to farms with increased levels of biodiversity. Field surveys and results reported in the literature suggest that agroecosystems are more resilient when inserted in a complex landscape matrix, featuring adapted local germplasm deployed in diversified cropping systems managed with organic matter rich soils and water conservation-harvesting techniques. The identification of systems that have withstood climatic events recently or in the past and understanding the agroecological features of such systems that allowed them to resist and/or recover from extreme events is of increased urgency, as the derived resiliency principles and practices that underlie successful farms can be disseminated to thousands of farmers via Campesino a Campesino networks to scale up agroecological practices that enhance the resiliency of agroecosystems. The effective diffusion of agroecological technologies will largely determine how well and how fast farmers adapt to climate change.},

Two independent AGCMs are utilized in order to assess the robustness of the response across different models. The results suggest that the atmospheric impacts of Arctic sea ice loss have been manifested most strongly within the maritime and coastal Arctic and in the lowermost atmosphere.

abstract = {The ERA5 reanalysis, recently made available by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), is a new reanalysis product at a high resolution replacing ERA-Interim and is considered to provide the best climate reanalysis over Greenland to date. However, so far little is known about the performance of ERA5 over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). In this study, we compare the near-surface climate from the new ERA5 reanalysis to ERA-Interim, the Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) as well as to a state-of-the-art polar regional climate model (MAR). The results show (1) that ERA5 does not outperform ERA-Interim significantly when compared with near-surface climate observations over GrIS, but ASR better models the near-surface temperature than both ERA reanalyses. (2) Polar regional climate models (e.g., MAR) are still a useful tool to downscale the GrIS climate compared to ERA5, as in particular the near-surface temperature in summer has a key role for representing snow and ice processes such as the surface melt. However, assimilating satellite data and using a more recent radiative scheme enable both ERA and ASR reanalyses to represent more satisfactorily than MAR the downward solar and infrared fluxes. (3) MAR near-surface climate is not affected when forced at its lateral boundaries by either ERA5 or ERA-Interim. Therefore, forcing polar regional climate models with ERA5 starting from 1950 will enable long and homogeneous surface mass balance reconstructions.},

This implies that there is a 1 in 10 chance that decadal hiatus periods may occur without the equatorial Pacific being the dominant pacemaker. In addition, the global ocean heat uptake tends to slow down during hiatus decades implying a fundamentally different global climate feedback factor on decadal time scales than on centennial time scales and calling for caution inferring climate sensitivity from decadal-scale variability.},

@article{tourre99_interdecadal,
abstract = {Interdecadal variability in sea level pressure (SLP)
and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the
Pacific Ocean was "quasiperiodic" from 1900-91. The
coherent variability of this phenomenon is
investigated using gridded observational data from
the turn of the century (SST and SLP) and of upper
ocean heat content (HS) from the recent two and a
half decades. The nominal cycle in atmosphere-ocean
variables is roughly two decades long, but growth
and decay can happen on a shorter timescale (e.g.,
half a cycle or so). The authors divide the full
cycle into four phases: An onset phase, during which
a weak SLP anomaly pattern off Japan takes
approximately 2-4 yr to expand eastward, leads to
large SLP anomalies in the region of the Aleutian
low. A quasistationary growth phase, with the
midlatitude SLP anomaly pattern in the eastern
ocean, intensifies over a 2-4 yr period. The
persistent SLP anomalies evolve in concert with
large SST (and HS anomalies) of the same polarity
located to the south-southwest along the subarctic
frontal zone (SAFZ). During the growth phase, SST
anomalies with opposite polarity develop to the
east, associated with anomalous atmospheric
circulation along the North American coastline. Near
the end of the growth phase a narrow tongue of
enhanced SST anomalies is found along the
subtropical front near Hawaii, slightly to the west
of the subduction region associated with the
subtropical gyre. Following is a decay phase during
which the midocean SST and SLP anomalies weaken,
while the HS anomalies persist in the southern part
of the subtropical gyre. Concomitantly, a weak
anomalous east-west SLP gradient is established in
the tropical Pacific and could contribute to the
interdecadal variability of the southern oscillation
index. Finally, a return phase occurs (identical to
the onset phase but with opposite polarity), during
which SST anomalies move from the Alaskan gyre and
from the center of the subtropical gyre to merge
onto the SAFZ. During the evolution of the
interdecadal phenomenon, the overall structure of
IIS highlights the notion that the subtropical gyre
integrates the thermal and dynamical forcing induced
by the persistent surface circulation anomaly. Since
only the oceanic anomalies retain their character
throughout the seasonal cycle, the interdecadal
phenomenon may owe its existence to coupled
ocean-atmosphere interaction in which ocean surface
anomalies feed back on the atmosphere providing the
necessary links between consecutive winter
seasons. It is suggested that this can occur through
interactions in either midlatitudes
(delayed-negative feedback) and/or the Tropics.},

virtually all the planetary-scale SLP trends over
the 42-yr period of record. The leading EOF
corresponds to the NH annular mode (NAM), and the
second EOF resembles the Pacific - North America

geopotential height field at various levels

well represented by linear combinations of these two

Interesting differences emerge when the EOF analysis

applications, such as the development of projections
of reservoir yields or the assessment of likely

catchment average rainfall be properly
represented. This persistence is often attributable
to low-frequency variability in the global sea
surface temperature (SST) field and other
large-scale climate variables through a complex
sequence of teleconnections. To evaluate the
capacity of general circulation models (GCMs) to
accurately represent this low-frequency variability,
a set of wavelet-based skill measures has been
developed to compare GCM performance in representing
interannual variability with the observed global SST
data, as well as to assess the extent to which this
variability is imparted in precipitation and surface
pressure anomaly fields. A validation of the derived
skill measures is performed using GCM precipitation
as an input in a reservoir storage context, with the
accuracy of reservoir storage estimates shown to be
improved by using GCM outputs that correctly
represent the observed low-frequency variability.
Significant differences in the performance of
different GCMs is demonstrated, suggesting that
judicious selection of models is required if the
climate impact assessment is sensitive to
low-frequency variability. The two GCMs that were
found to exhibit the most appropriate representation
of global low-frequency variability for individual

performed well. Importantly, models that represented
interannual variability well for SST also performed
well for the other two variables, while models that
performed poorly for SST also had consistently low

Here we explore the 2016 Arctic sea ice state in terms of its monthly sea ice cover, placing this in the context of the sea ice conditions observed since 2000. We demonstrate the sensitivity of monthly Arctic sea ice extent and area estimates, in terms of their magnitude and annual rankings, to the ice concentration input data (using two widely used datasets) and to the averaging methodology used to convert concentration to extent (daily or monthly extent calculations). We use estimates of sea ice area over sea ice extent to analyse the relative "compactness" of the Arctic sea ice cover, highlighting anomalously low compactness in the summer of 2016 which contributed to the higher-Than-expected September ice extent. Two cyclones that entered the Arctic Ocean during August appear to have driven this low-concentration/compactness ice cover but were not sufficient to cause more widespread melt-out and a new record-low September ice extent. We use concentration budgets to explore the regions and processes (thermodynamics/dynamics) contributing to the monthly 2016 extent/area estimates highlighting, amongst other things, rapid ice intensification across the central eastern Arctic through September. Two different products show significant early melt onset across the Arctic Ocean in 2016, including record-early melt onset in the North Atlantic sector of the Arctic. Our results also show record-late 2016 freeze-up in the central Arctic, North Atlantic and the Alaskan Arctic sector in particular, associated with strong sea surface temperature anomalies that appeared shortly after the 2016 minimum (October onwards). We explore the implications of this low summer ice compactness for seasonal forecasting, suggesting that sea ice area could be a more reliable metric to forecast in this more seasonal, "New Arctic", sea ice regime.},

abstract = {This paper aims to understand the physical processes causing the large spread in the storm track projections of the CMIP5 climate models. In particular, the relationship between the climate change responses of the storm tracks, as measured by the 2-6 day mean sea level pressure variance, and the equator-to-pole temperature differences at upper- and lower-tropospheric levels is investigated. In the southern hemisphere the responses of the upper- and lower-tropospheric temperature differences are correlated across the models and as a result they share similar associations with the storm track responses. There are large regions in which the storm track responses are correlated with the temperature difference responses, and a simple linear regression model based on the temperature differences at either level captures the spatial pattern of the mean storm track response as well explaining between 30 and 60 {\%} of the inter-model variance of the storm track responses. In the northern hemisphere the responses of the two temperature differences are not significantly correlated and their associations with the storm track responses are more complicated. In summer, the responses of the lower-tropospheric temperature differences dominate the inter-model spread of the storm track responses. In winter, the responses of the upper- and lower-temperature differences both play a role. The results suggest that there is potential to reduce the spread in storm track responses by constraining the relative magnitudes of the warming in the tropical and polar regions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

correlation, and cluster analyses. Chronologies were
categorized based on the sites' proximity to upper

found in all elevational proximity classes and all

associations with (i) positive response to previous
autumn, winter, and spring precipitation, (ii)
positive response to spring and (or) summer
precipitation Coupled with an inverse relationship
with Summer temperature, (iii) positive response to
winter and (or) spring precipitation coupled with an
inverse relationship with spring temperature, and
(iv) positive associations With temperature in all

associated with temperatures were from sites located
near upper treeline and also contain significant

Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon on
drought severity at the global scale. A unique
aspect of the analysis is that the ENSO influence
was quantified using a multiscalar drought
indicator, which allowed assessment of the role of
the ENSO phases on drought types affecting various
hydrological, agricultural and environmental
systems. The study was based on ENSO composites
corresponding to El Nino and La Nina phases, which
were obtained from the winter El Nino 3.4 index for
the period 1901-2006. Drought was identified in a
multiscalar way using the Standardized Precipitation
Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the global
SPEIbase data set. The study revealed the differing
impacts of the El Nino and La Nina phases on drought
severity, the time scales of droughts, and the
period of the year when the ENSO phases explained
drought variability worldwide. In large areas of
America and eastern Europe the role of ENSO events
were evident at the shortest time scales (1-3
months) at the beginning of events, but in areas of
South Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia the
effects were more obvious some months later, and at
longer time scales. We also identified areas where
severe drought conditions are associated with more
than 70{\%} of ENSO events. The persistence of the
drought signal at longer time-scales (e.g., 6- or
12-months) is not directly determined by the
atmospheric circulation response to the SST
anomalies, since the SPEI anomalies will be caused
by the cumulative dry conditions in some specific
months. Knowledge of how these effects differ as a
function of the El Nino and La Nina phases, and how
they propagate throughout the drought time scales
could aid in the prediction of the expected drought
severity associated with the ENSO. Lags detected
during the study may help forecasting of dry
conditions in some regions up to one year before
their occurrence.},

@article{Maher2021,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Single model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs) are valuable tools that can be used to investigate the climate system. SMILEs allow scientists to quantify and separate the internal variability of the climate system and its response to external forcing, with different types of SMILEs appropriate to answer different scientific questions. In this editorial we first provide an introduction to SMILEs and an overview of the studies in the special issue “Large Ensemble Climate Model Simulations: Exploring Natural Variability, Change Signals and Impacts”. These studies analyse a range of different types of SMILEs including global climate models (GCMs), regionally downscaled climate models (RCMs), a hydrological model with input from a RCM SMILE, a SMILE with prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) built for event attribution, a SMILE that assimilates observed data, and an initialised regional model. These studies provide novel methods, that can be used with SMILEs. The methods published in this issue include a snapshot empirical orthogonal function analysis used to investigate El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation teleconnections; the partitioning of future uncertainty into model differences, internal variability, and scenario choices; a weighting scheme for multi-model ensembles that can incorporate SMILEs; and a method to identify the required ensemble size for any given problem. Studies in this special issue also focus on RCM SMILEs, with projections of the North Atlantic Oscillation and its regional impacts assessed over Europe, and an RCM SMILE intercomparison. Finally a subset of studies investigate projected impacts of global warming, with increased water flows projected for future hydrometeorological events in southern Ontario; precipitation projections over central Europe are investigated and found to be inconsistent across models in the Alps, with a continuation of past tendencies in Mid-Europe; and equatorial Asia is found to have an increase in the probability of large fire and drought events under higher levels of warming. These studies demonstrate the utility of different types of SMILEs. In the second part of this editorial we provide a perspective on how three types of SMILEs could be combined to exploit the advantages of each. To do so we use a GCM SMILE and an RCM SMILE with all forcings, as well as a naturally forced GCM SMILE (nat-GCM) over the European domain. We utilise one of the key advantages of SMILEs, precisely separating the forced response and internal variability within an individual model to investigate a variety of simple questions. Broadly we show that the GCM can be used to investigate broad-scale patterns and can be directly compared to the nat-GCM to attribute forced changes to either anthropogenic emissions or volcanoes. The RCM provides high-resolution spatial information of both the forced change and the internal variability around this change at different warming levels. By combining all three ensembles we can gain information that would not be available using a single type of SMILE alone, providing a perspective on future research that could be undertaken using these tools.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {AbstractThis paper examines the trajectories followed by intense intrusions of moist air into the Arctic polar region during autumn and winter and their impact on local temperature and sea ice concentration. It is found that the vertical structure of the warming associated with moist intrusions is bottom amplified, corresponding to a transition of local conditions from a “cold clear” state with a strong inversion to a “warm opaque” state with a weaker inversion. In the marginal sea ice zone of the Barents Sea, the passage of an intrusion also causes a retreat of the ice margin, which persists for many days after the intrusion has passed. The authors find that there is a positive trend in the number of intrusion events crossing 70°N during December and January that can explain roughly 45{\%} of the surface air temperature and 30{\%} of the sea ice concentration trends observed in the Barents Sea during the past two decades.},

Observed interdecadal climate variations are decomposed into several' discriminants, mutually uncorrelated spatiotemporal components with a maximal ratio of interdecadal-to-intradecadal variance. The dominant discriminants of twentieth-century variations in surface temperature exhibit large-scale warming in which, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere summer months, localized cooling is embedded. The structure of the large-scale warming is consistent with expected effects of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations. The localized cooling, with maxima on scales of 1000-2000 km over East Asia, eastern Europe, and North America, is suggestive of radiative effects of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols.},

In this review, we synthesize current understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that can give rise to AA. These mechanisms include both local feedbacks and changes in poleward energy transport. Temperature and sea ice-related feedbacks are especially important for AA, since they are significantly more positive over the Arctic than at lower latitudes. Changes in energy transport by the atmosphere and ocean can also contribute to AA. These energy transport changes are tightly coupled with local feedbacks, and thus their respective contributions to AA should not be considered in isolation. It is here emphasized that the feedbacks and energy transport changes that give rise to AA are sensitively dependent on the state of the climate system itself. This implies that changes in the climate state will lead to changes in the strength of AA, with implications for past and future climate change.},

abstract = {Historical reanalyses that span more than a century are needed for a wide range of studies, from understanding large-scale climate trends to diagnosing the impacts of individual historical extreme weather events. The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) Project is an effort to fill this need. It is supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and is facilitated by collaboration with the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth initiative. 20CR is the first ensemble of sub-daily global atmospheric conditions spanning over 100 years. This provides a best estimate of the weather at any given place and time as well as an estimate of its confidence and uncertainty. While extremely useful, version 2c of this dataset (20CRv2c) has several significant issues, including inaccurate estimates of confidence and a global sea level pressure bias in the mid-19th century. These and other issues can reduce its effectiveness for studies at many spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, the 20CR system underwent a series of developments to generate a significant new version of the reanalysis. The version 3 system (NOAA-CIRES-DOE 20CRv3) uses upgraded data assimilation methods including an adaptive inflation algorithm; has a newer, higher-resolution forecast model that specifies dry air mass; and assimilates a larger set of pressure observations. These changes have improved the ensemble-based estimates of confidence, removed spin-up effects in the precipitation fields, and diminished the sea-level pressure bias. Other improvements include more accurate representations of storm intensity, smaller errors, and large-scale reductions in model bias. The 20CRv3 system is comprehensively reviewed, focusing on the aspects that have ameliorated issues in 20CRv2c. Despite the many improvements, some challenges remain, including a systematic bias in tropical precipitation and time-varying biases in southern high-latitude pressure fields.},

abstract = {Neural networks have become increasingly prevalent within the geosciences, although a common limitation of their usage has been a lack of methods to interpret what the networks learn and how they make decisions. As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backward optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to common climate patterns. These results suggest that combining interpretable neural networks with novel scientific hypotheses will open the door to many new avenues in neural network-related geoscience research.},

While climate change mitigation targets necessarily concern maximum mean state changes, understanding impacts and developing adaptation strategies will be largely contingent on how climate variability responds to increasing anthropogenic perturbations. Thus far Earth system modeling efforts have primarily focused on projected mean state changes and the sensitivity of specific modes of climate variability, such as the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation. However, our knowledge of forced changes in the overall spectrum of climate variability and higher-order statistics is relatively limited. Here we present a new 100-member large ensemble of climate change projections conducted with the Community Earth System Model version 2 over 1850–2100 to examine the sensitivity of internal climate fluctuations to greenhouse warming. Our unprecedented simulations reveal that changes in variability, considered broadly in terms of probability distribution, amplitude, frequency, phasing, and patterns, are ubiquitous and span a wide range of physical and ecosystem variables across many spatial and temporal scales. Greenhouse warming in the model alters variance spectra of Earth system variables that are characterized by non-Gaussian probability distributions, such as rainfall, primary production, or fire occurrence. Our modeling results have important implications for climate adaptation efforts, resource management, seasonal predictions, and assessing potential stressors for terrestrial and marine ecosystems.]]{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

twentieth century are identified through a
multivariate frequency domain singular value
decomposition. This analysis indicates that a
secular trend and variability related to the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are the dominant
modes of variance shared among the global
datasets. For the SST data the secular trend
corresponds to a positive trend in Indian Ocean and
South Atlantic SSTs, and a negative trend in North
Pacific and North Atlantic SSTs. The ENSO
reconstruction shows a strong signal in the tropical
Pacific, North Pacific, and Indian Ocean
regions. For the PDSI data, the secular trend
reconstruction shows high amplitudes over central
Africa including the Sahel, whereas the regions with
strong ENSO amplitudes in PDSI are the southwestern
and northwestern United States, South Africa,
northeastern Brazil, central Africa, the Indian
subcontinent, and Australia. An additional
significant frequency, multidecadal variability, is
identified for the Northern Hemisphere. This
multidecadal frequency appears to be related to the
Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO). The
multidecadal frequency is statistically significant
in the Northern Hemisphere SST data, but is
statistically nonsignificant in the PDSI data.},

Overall, variance in sea ice thickness is greatest along Arctic Ocean coastlines. Sea ice thickness anomalies have a typical time scale of about 6–20 months, a time scale that lengthens about a season when accounting for ice transport, and a typical length scale of about 500–1000 km. The range of these scales across GCMs implies that an estimate of the number of thickness monitoring locations needed to characterize the full Arctic basin sea ice thickness variability field is model dependent and would vary between 3 and 14.

abstract = {Internal climate variability will play a major role in determining change on regional scales under global warming. In the extratropics, large-scale atmospheric circulation is responsible for much of observed regional climate variability, from seasonal to multidecadal timescales. However, the extratropical circulation variability on multidecadal timescales is systematically weaker in coupled climate models. Here we show that projections of future extratropical climate from coupled model simulations significantly underestimate the projected uncertainty range originating from large-scale atmospheric circulation variability. Using observational datasets and large ensembles of coupled climate models, we produce synthetic ensemble projections constrained to have variability consistent with the large-scale atmospheric circulation in observations. Compared to the raw model projections, the synthetic observationally-constrained projections exhibit an increased uncertainty in projected 21st century temperature and precipitation changes across much of the Northern extratropics. This increased uncertainty is also associated with an increase of the projected occurrence of future extreme seasons. Future projections of northern hemisphere extratropical climate based on climate model simulations substantially underestimate the uncertainty that originates from large-scale atmospheric circulation variability, suggest synthetic ensemble projections constrained with observations.},

the global moisture budget from the global analyses
of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF), the U.S. National Meteorological
Center (NMC), and NASA/Goddard have been computed
and compared. The precipitable water is computed and
compared with satellite data from the Special Sensor
Microwave Imager (SSM/I). Fluxes of moisture and
their divergence have been used to estimate the
vertically integrated moisture budget and thus
evaporation minus precipitation (E - P) as
residuals. Results of several test computations show
that small biases exist in precipitable water as
vertical resolution and methods of computing
vertical integrals are changed, but the impact is
small on the moisture budget. In the Tropics and
subtropics the moisture budget is dominated by the
divergence field rather than the moisture amounts,
and consequently initialization of the analyses has
an impact on the perceived moisture budget. The
diurnal cycle is shown to be important especially
for E - P. For the vertically integrated moisture
budget, the use of pressure coordinates instead of
the model coordinates on which the data are analyzed
produces acceptably small differences for the most
part, although adequate resolution at low levels and
proper treatment of the surface is
important. Computations at different horizontal
resolutions reveal the importance of adequate
resolution in the vicinity of steep orography but
also that resolution is not a big factor on large
scales even where steep gradients in precipitation
exist. The implication is that it is the veracity bf
the large-scale divergence and moisture fields
themselves that contribute to problems, and these
arise from the moist physics of the assimilating
model used in four-dimensional data assimilation,
which dominates the character of the
analyses. However, in the subtropics large positive
biases are present in precipitable water in the
ECMWF and, to a lesser extent, NMC analyses and are
partly due to the assimilation of biased TOVS
retrievals. The effects of the large and spurious
changes in analysis systems at ECMWF and NMC are
manifested in the results. Differences between ECMWF
and NMC E - P locally are 60{\%}-75{\%} of the values
themselves in the Tropics at T31 resolution and
about one-half as much at T15 resolution, and they
are not diminishing with time. By making use of
estimates off and P from the NASA/Goddard
reanalysis, both spatial and temporal variability of
E - P are found to be dominated by the P
field. Accordingly, for part of 1987 and 1988,
estimates of precipitation from the Global
Precipitation Climatology Project are used to
qualitatively assess the E - P estimates. The ECMWF
estimates appear to be best at that time, but since
then the NMC values have become less intense while
the ECMWF estimates have greatly intensified. The
large differences that still exist in such estimates
are apt to be carried over to the NMC and ECMWF
reanalysis products.},

We review the scientific evidence behind three leading hypotheses on the influence of Arctic changes on mid-latitude summer weather: Weakened storm tracks, shifted jet streams, and amplified quasi-stationary waves. We show that interactions between Arctic teleconnections and other remote and regional feedback processes could lead to more persistent hot-dry extremes in the mid-latitudes.

abstract = {As climate change research becomes increasingly applied, the need for actionable information is growing rapidly. A key aspect of this requirement is the representation of uncertainties. The conventional approach to representing uncertainty in physical aspects of climate change is probabilistic, based on ensembles of climate model simulations. In the face of deep uncertainties, the known limitations of this approach are becoming increasingly apparent. An alternative is thus emerging which may be called a ‘storyline' approach. We define a storyline as a physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways. No a priori probability of the storyline is assessed; emphasis is placed instead on understanding the driving factors involved, and the plausibility of those factors. We introduce a typology of four reasons for using storylines to represent uncertainty in physical aspects of climate change: (i) improving risk awareness by framing risk in an event-oriented rather than a probabilistic manner, which corresponds more directly to how people perceive and respond to risk; (ii) strengthening decision-making by allowing one to work backward from a particular vulnerability or decision point, combining climate change information with other relevant factors to address compound risk and develop appropriate stress tests; (iii) providing a physical basis for partitioning uncertainty, thereby allowing the use of more credible regional models in a conditioned manner and (iv) exploring the boundaries of plausibility, thereby guarding against false precision and surprise. Storylines also offer a powerful way of linking physical with human aspects of climate change.},

Here we apply novel techniques to diagnose the contributors to the shortwave (SW) effective radiative forcing (ERF) from aerosol-radiation-interaction (ERFari) and from aerosol cloud interaction (ERFaci) in experiments performed in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We find that the ensemble mean SW ERFari+aci of -1.40±0.56 W m-2 comes roughly 25{\%} from ERFari (-0.35±0.20 W m-2) and 75{\%} from ERFaci (-1.04±0.67 W m-2). ERFari is made up of -0.62±0.30 W m-2 due to aerosol scattering opposed by +0.26 ± 0.12 W m-2 due to aerosol absorption and is largest near emission sources. The ERFari from nonsulfate aerosols is +0.13 ± 0.09 W m-2, consisting of -0.15±0.11 W m-2 of scattering and +0.29 ± 0.15 W m-2 of absorption. The change in clear-sky flux is a negatively biased measure of ERFari, as the presence of clouds reduces the magnitude and intermodel spread of ERFari by 40-50{\%}. ERFaci, which is large both near and downwind of emission sources, is composed of -0.99±0.54 W m-2 from enhanced cloud scattering, with much smaller contributions from increased cloud amount and absorption. In models that allow aerosols to affect ice clouds, large increases in the optical depth of high clouds cause substantial longwave and shortwave radiative anomalies. Intermodel spread in ERFaci is dominated by differences in how aerosols increase cloud scattering, but even if all models agreed on this effect, over a fifth of the spread in ERFaci would remain due solely to differences in total cloud amount.

abstract = {Analytical theory is used to examine the linear
response of a meridionally unbounded stratified
ocean to large-scale, low-frequency wind
forcing. The following results, applied mainly to
the equatorial Pacific, were obtained. (i) Provided
that the wind stress curl vanishes at large distance
from the equator, a general Sverdrup solution is
valid in the quasi-steady (frequency omega -{\textgreater} 0)
limit. The meridionally averaged zonal flow toward
the western boundary layer is zero so that there is
no net mass flow into the boundary layer and the
large-scale boundary condition is therefore
satisfied. This solution predicts a zero pycnocline
response in the eastern equatorial Pacific. It
therefore predicts that, for the eastern equatorial
Pacific, a slow weakening of the equatorial trade
winds will not lead to long-term El Nino conditions
there. (ii) Consistent with observations and other
previous work, for finite but small frequencies
there are two modes of equatorial motion. One is a
"tilt'' mode in which the equatorial sea level and
thermocline are tilted by the in-phase zonal wind
stress and the other is an equatorial warm water
volume (WWV) mode in which the discharge of
equatorial warm water (negative WWV anomaly) lags
the wind stress forcing by a quarter of a
period. (iii) The amplitude of the WWV mode
approaches zero like omega(1/2). Therefore, as omega
-{\textgreater} 0, the equatorial solution reduces to the tilt
mode. (iv) The WWV mode is not due to a dominant
meridional divergence driven by the wind, as
suggested by some previous work. Meridional and
zonal divergence approximately cancel. Reflection of
energy at both ocean boundaries together with the
strong dependence of long Rossby wave speed on
latitude is crucial to the existence of the
disequilibrium WWV mode. Because higher-latitude
Rossby waves travel so much more slowly, the Rossby
waves reflecting from the western ocean boundary are
not in phase. This gives rise to a reflected
equatorial Kelvin wave and a WWV that is not in
phase with the wind stress forcing. (v) Observations
from past work have shown that much low-frequency
wave energy, particularly westward propagating
Rossby wave energy poleward of about 5 degrees N and
5 degrees S, is damped out before it reaches the
western ocean boundary. In this way dissipation
likely has a strong influence on the equatorial
Kelvin wave reflection and hence the disequilibrium
WWV.},

abstract = {Onset of the growing season in mid-latitudes is a
period of rapid transition, which includes
heightened interaction between living organisms and
the lower atmosphere. Phenological events (seasonal
plant and animal activity driven by environmental
factors), such as first leaf appearance or flower
bloom in plants, can serve as convenient markers to
monitor the progression of this yearly shift, and
assess longer-term change resulting from climate
variations. We examined spring seasons across North
America over the 1900-1997 period using modelled and
actual lilac phenological data. Regional differences
were detected, as well as an average 5-6 day advance
toward earlier springs, over a 35-year period from
1959-1993. Driven by seasonally warmer temperatures,
this modification agrees with earlier bird nesting
times, and corresponds to a comparable advance of
spring plant phenology described in Europe. These
results also align with trends towards longer
growing seasons, reported by recent carbon dioxide
and satellite studies. North American spring warming
is strongest regionally in the northwest and
northeast portions. Meanwhile, slight autumn cooling
is apparent in the central USA. Copyright (C) 2000

over western North America account for 20{\%}-50{\%} of
the variance of annual precipitation. Spatially, the
decadal variability is broken into several regional
[O(1000 km)] components. These decadal variations
are contributed by fluctuations in precipitation
from seasons of the year that vary from region to
region and that are not necessarily concentrated in
the wettest season(s) alone. The precipitation
variations are linked to various decadal atmospheric
circulation and SST anomaly patterns where scales
range from regional to global scales and that
emphasize tropical or extratropical connections,
depending upon which precipitation region is
considered. Further, wet or dry decades are
associated with changes in frequency of at least a
few shea-period circulation "modes" such as the
pacific-North American pattern. precipitation
fluctuations over the southwestern United States and
the Saskatchewan region of western Canada are
associated with extensive shifts of sea level
pressure and SST anomalies, suggesting that they are
components of low-frequency precipitation
variability from global-scale climate
processes. Consistent with the global scale of its
pressure and SST connection, the Southwest decadal
precipitation is aligned with opposing precipitation
fluctuations in northern Africa.},

abstract = {Variations in the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are associated with a wide array of regional climate extremes and ecosystem impacts1. Robust, long-lead forecasts would therefore be valuable for managing policy responses. But despite decades of effort, forecasting ENSO events at lead times of more than one year remains problematic2. Here we show that a statistical forecast model employing a deep-learning approach produces skilful ENSO forecasts for lead times of up to one and a half years. To circumvent the limited amount of observation data, we use transfer learning to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) first on historical simulations3 and subsequently on reanalysis from 1871 to 1973. During the validation period from 1984 to 2017, the all-season correlation skill of the Nino3.4 index of the CNN model is much higher than those of current state-of-the-art dynamical forecast systems. The CNN model is also better at predicting the detailed zonal distribution of sea surface temperatures, overcoming a weakness of dynamical forecast models. A heat map analysis indicates that the CNN model predicts ENSO events using physically reasonable precursors. The CNN model is thus a powerful tool for both the prediction of ENSO events and for the analysis of their associated complex mechanisms. A statistical forecast model using a deep-learning approach produces useful forecasts of El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation events with lead times of up to one and a half years.},

abstract = {The western equatorial Pacific warm pool is believed
to be the source region of a substantial proportion
of the world's inter-annual climate variability,
including the globally significant El Nino-Southern
Oscillation. Here new data are presented on changes
in the climate of this region over the past 70 yr,
based on analysis of the stable oxygen isotopic
composition of annually banded, massive corals
living on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. In
this area, the coincidence of abundant and
isotopically light rainfall with small seasonal and
inter-annual changes in temperature means that the
coral skeletal delta(18)O record may be reliably
interpreted in terms of rainfall variation. Since
the abundance of rainfall is governed by the
intensity of deep atmospheric convection, the coral
records provide regionally significant, and
regionally reproducible, climatic indices. In
particular, the coral records indicate larger
changes in the degree of coupling of the climate of
the region with the Southern Oscillation than have
hitherto been described. These changes in coupling,
which accompany shifts in the dominant periodicities
of inter-annual climate variation, are indicative of
rapid and large-scale reorganisation of
ocean-atmosphere interactions. The data indicate
that from the 1920s to 1950s the western equatorial
Pacific was less important in modulating Pacific and
global inter-annual climatic variability than it has
appeared to be subsequently. The reproducibility of
the coral climate records, combined with the
presence on the north coast of Papua New Guinea of
extensive and well preserved raised reef terraces,
leads to the potential for extending understanding
of climatic variability in this globally important
region back into the late Quaternary.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new Sea surface temperature (SST) analysis that is produced with global coverage on a daily basis at the Met Office called the Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system. OSTIA uses satellite SST data provided by international agencies via the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) framework. GHRSST products include data from microwave and infrared satellite instruments with accompanying uncertainty estimates. The system also uses in situ SST data available over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and a sea-ice concentration product from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Applications Facility (OSI-SAF). The SST analysis is a multi-scale optimal interpolation that is designed for applications in numerical weather prediction and ocean forecasting systems. The background error covariance matrix is specified using ocean model data and the analysis uses correlation length scales of 10. km and 100. km. The OSTIA system produces a foundation SST estimate (SSTfnd, which is the SST free of diurnal variability) at an output grid resolution of 1/20° ({\~{}}. 6. km) although the smallest analysis feature resolution is based on the correlation length scale of 10. km. All satellite SST data are adjusted for bias errors based on a combination of ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) SST data and in situ SST measurements from drifting buoys. Data are filtered (based on surface wind speed data) to remove diurnal variability and AATSR data are adjusted to represent the SST at the same depth as drifting buoy measurements (0.2-1. m) before bias adjustments are made. Global coverage outputs are provided each day in GHRSST L4 netCDF format. A variety of secondary products are also provided including weekly and monthly mean data sets. OSTIA products are continuously monitored and validation/verification activities demonstrate that SST products have zero mean bias and an accuracy of {\~{}}. 0.57. K compared to in situ measurements. OSTIA is now used operationally as a boundary condition for all weather forecast models at the Met Office and at European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). OSTIA is produced by the Met Office as part of the European Union Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) MyOcean project. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

@article{Rasch2008,
abstract = {We provide an overview of geoengineering by stratospheric sulphate aerosols. The state of understanding about this topic as of early 2008 is reviewed, summarizing the past 30 years of work in the area, highlighting some very recent studies using climate models, and discussing methods used to deliver sulphur species to the stratosphere. The studies reviewed here suggest that sulphate aerosols can counteract the globally averaged temperature increase associated with increasing greenhouse gases, and reduce changes to some other components of the Earth system. There are likely to be remaining regional climate changes after geoengineering, with some regions experiencing significant changes in temperature or precipitation. The aerosols also serve as surfaces for heterogeneous chemistry resulting in increased ozone depletion. The delivery of sulphur species to the stratosphere in a way that will produce particles of the right size is shown to be a complex and potentially very difficult task. Two simple delivery scenarios are explored, but similar exercises will be needed for other suggested delivery mechanisms. While the introduction of the geoengineering source of sulphate aerosol will perturb the sulphur cycle of the stratosphere signicantly, it is a small perturbation to the total (stratosphere and troposphere) sulphur cycle. The geoengineering source would thus be a small contributor to the total global source of 'acid rain' that could be compensated for through improved pollution control of anthropogenic tropospheric sources. Some areas of research remain unexplored. Although ozone may be depleted, with a consequent increase to solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) energy reaching the surface and a potential impact on health and biological populations, the aerosols will also scatter and attenuate this part of the energy spectrum, and this may compensate the UVB enhancement associated with ozone depletion. The aerosol will also change the ratio of diffuse to direct energy reaching the surface, and this may influence ecosystems. The impact of geoengineering on these components of the Earth system has not yet been studied. Representations for the formation, evolution and removal of aerosol and distribution of particle size are still very crude, and more work will be needed to gain confidence in our understanding of the deliberate production of this class of aerosols and their role in the climate system.},

@article{Screen2019b,
abstract = {In a recent Letter, Mori et al. 1 examined connections in observations and climate models between reduced Arctic sea ice and the 'warm Arctic and cold Eurasia' (WACE) pattern. They concluded that models systemically underestimate Eurasian cooling in response to sea-ice loss, relative to observations. If correct, their result implies that up to half of the observed Eurasian cooling from 1995-2014 is attributable to sea-ice loss 1 , whereas previous studies have found a negligible contribution from sea-ice loss 2-4. Here, we highlight that their comparisons between observations and models are not like-for-like, and show that when fair comparisons are made, modelled and observed estimates are consistent with each other. The upward adjustment of the contribution of sea-ice loss to observed Eurasian cooling in Mori et al. 1 is therefore unjustified. An essential first step in model evaluation is to derive an observational benchmark against which models can be assessed. Mori et al. 1 seek an observational estimate of the WACE response to Barents-Kara sea-ice loss. Their approach is to correlate time series of the WACE pattern and Barents-Kara sea ice. They interpret the squared correlation coefficient multiplied by the WACE variance (hereafter r 2 $\sigma$ 2) as the fraction of WACE variance driven by sea ice. In doing so, they make an assumption about causality. Their apparent justification for this causal inference is that their analysis detects WACE as the main pattern of sea-ice-driven temperature variability. However, the WACE pattern also varies irrespective of sea ice and, as a result, their observed time series of the WACE (EC ERA) contains both variability driven by sea ice and variability not driven by sea ice. It is important to note that even the non-sea-ice-driven component will correlate with Barents-Kara sea ice because a warm Arctic causes reduced sea ice, and vice versa. Sea ice and WACE variability will correlate because the Arctic temperature and sea ice are strongly and physically connected, even if Eurasian temperature is minimally affected by sea ice, as recent work suggests 5. For the reasons just given, the interpretation of r 2 $\sigma$ 2 as the fraction of WACE variance driven by sea ice is questionable and, as we will demonstrate, it is probably an overestimation. Mori et al. 1 also calculate r 2 $\sigma$ 2 from atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments in which sea ice is specified. The interaction between ice and the atmosphere is only in one direction in this experimental setup: the atmospheric response to varying sea ice is represented, but the response of sea ice to atmospheric variation is not. Mori et al. 1 report that the observed r 2 $\sigma$ 2 value is roughly twice as high as those obtained from seven different AGCMs, leading them to conclude that models systemically underestimate the WACE response to sea-ice loss. However, their comparison between observations and AGCMs is misleading because the observed r 2 $\sigma$ 2 reflects two-way interactions between sea ice and the atmosphere, rather than the one-way influence of sea ice on the atmosphere in AGCM-derived r 2 $\sigma$ 2. Here, we test the extent to which r 2 $\sigma$ 2 is suppressed by a lack of two-way interactions in AGCM simulations. We first reproduced the results of Mori et al. 1 (with minor methodological differences; see Methods), which confirms that none of the seven AGCMs reproduce the observed r 2 $\sigma$ 2 (Fig. 1a). It is important to note that this discrepancy is seen in both the winter months collectively (Fig. 1a) and in winter averages (see fig. 4a in Mori et al. 1), which strongly suggests that the origin of the model-observation disparity is not timescale dependent , and justifies our use of monthly averages in what follows. Next, we compared output from an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) and an AGCM prescribed with sea ice and sea surface temperatures taken from the parent AOGCM (see Methods). The r 2 $\sigma$ 2 value in the AOGCM experiment is roughly twice as high as that in the AGCM (Fig. 1b), which we attribute to the simulation of two-way atmosphere-ice interaction in the AOGCM not present in the AGCM. The smaller r 2 $\sigma$ 2 value in AGCMs compared with observations shown originally by Mori et al. 1 and reproduced here in Fig. 1a need not imply model error. Instead, it could be largely explained by the lack of two-way interaction in AGCM experiments and the inability of the r 2 $\sigma$ 2 method to extract the sea-ice-driven fraction of observed WACE variability. We caution against directly comparing the observed (Fig. 1a) and AOGCM-derived (Fig. 1b) r 2 $\sigma$ 2 values as they correspond to different climate states. Although the observed r 2 $\sigma$ 2 is higher than in the AOGCM, this probably reflects greater sea-ice variability (by {\~{}}50{\%}; not shown) in the recent past compared with the pre-industrial climate, rather than model error. We note that the higher r 2 $\sigma$ 2 value in the AOGCM compared with the AGCM (Fig. 1b) could arise due to one of two reasons: coupling is necessary to simulate the effects of WACE variability on sea ice, or ocean feedbacks amplify the WACE response to sea-ice loss. Regarding the former, coupled models simulate the effects of WACE-related atmospheric circulation variability on Barents-Kara sea ice similarly to the real world 5. Regarding the latter, it is clear that ocean feedbacks would strengthen the local warming response to sea-ice loss. However, this need not imply any change in Eurasian cooling. Indeed, Deser et al. 6 showed that ocean coupling enhanced the Arctic warming and atmospheric circulation responses to sea-ice loss, but suppressed Eurasian cooling. Surveying the literature, there is no evidence that coupled models simulate stronger Eurasian cooling in response to sea-ice loss than uncoupled models 6-10. To gain further insight, and building on work by Blackport et al. 5 , we propose a refined approach to estimate the WACE variance driven by sea ice that can be applied equally to observations and AGCMs. We hypothesize that a better estimate can be obtained from the correlation between the WACE and Barents-Kara sea ice in the preceding month, rather than using the contemporaneous correlation. Lead-lag correlation is a common first step in causal discovery arising from M. Mori et al. Nature Climate Change https://doi.

Some studies suggest that reduced autumn sea ice may be a precursor to severe midlatitude winters. Here we use coupled ocean–atmosphere model experiments to investigate the extent to which the winter atmospheric circulation response to Arctic sea ice loss is driven by sea ice loss in preceding months. We impose different seasonal cycles of sea ice by using various combinations of sea ice albedo parameters. Year-round sea ice loss causes an equatorward migration of the eddy-driven jet and a shift toward the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation in winter. However, these circulation changes are not found when sea ice is reduced only in late summer and autumn, despite high-latitude warming persisting into the winter. Our results imply that the winter atmospheric circulation response to sea ice loss is primarily driven by sea ice loss in winter rather than in autumn.},

The theory makes it possible to discuss the latitudinal (y) and vertical (z) dependence of ∂ū/∂t qualitatively and calculate it directly from an approximate knowledge of the wave structure.

abstract = {Simulations of Arctic surface air temperature and sea level pressure by 14 global climate models used in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are synthesized in an analysis of biases and trends. Simulated composite GCM surface air temperatures for 1981-2000 are generally 1°-2°C colder than corresponding observations with the exception of a cold bias maximum of 6°-8°C in the Barents Sea. The Barents Sea bias, most prominent in winter and spring, occurs in 12 of the 14 GCMs and corresponds to a region of oversimulated sea ice. All models project a twenty-first-century warming that is largest in the autumn and winter, although the rates of the projected warming vary considerably among the models. The across-model and across-scenario uncertainties in the projected temperatures are comparable through the first half of the twenty-first century, but increases in variability associated with the choice of scenario begin to outpace increases in across-model variability by about the year 2070. By the end of the twenty-first century, the cross-scenario variability is about 50{\%} greater than the across-model variability. The biases of sea level pressure are smaller than in the previous generation of global climate models, although the models still show a positive bias of sea level pressure in the Eurasian sector of the Arctic Ocean, surrounded by an area of negative pressure biases. This bias is consistent with an inability of the North Atlantic storm track to penetrate the Eurasian portion of the Arctic Ocean. The changes of sea level pressure projected for the twenty-first century are negative over essentially the entire Arctic. The most significant decreases of pressure are projected for the Bering Strait region, primarily in autumn and winter. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Despite ongoing increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases, the Earth's global average surface air temperature has remained more or less steady since 2001. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this slowdown in surface warming. A key component of the global hiatus that has been identified is cool eastern Pacific sea surface temperature, but it is unclear how the ocean has remained relatively cool there in spite of ongoing increases in radiative forcing. Here we show that a pronounced strengthening in Pacific trade winds over the past two decades—unprecedented in observations/reanalysis data and not captured by climate models—is sufficient to account for the cooling of the tropical Pacific and a substantial slowdown in surface warming through increased subsurface ocean heat uptake. The extra uptake has come about through increased subduction in the Pacific shallow overturning cells, enhancing heat convergence in the equatorial thermocline. At the same time, the accelerated trade winds have increased equatorial upwelling in the central and eastern Pacific, lowering sea surface temperature there, which drives further cooling in other regions. The net effect of these anomalous winds is a cooling in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1–0.2 °C, which can account for much of the hiatus in surface warming observed since 2001. This hiatus could persist for much of the present decade if the trade wind trends continue, however rapid warming is expected to resume once the anomalous wind trends abate. The slowdown in global average surface warming has recently been linked to sea surface cooling in the eastern Pacific Ocean. This work shows that strengthening trade winds caused a reduction in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1–0.2 °C. This may account for much of the warming hiatus and is a result of increased subsurface ocean heat uptake.},

This study explores the following hypothesis about this lag: in order to achieve amplification of the wave activity, the vertically propagating Rossby wave train associated with the snow cover anomaly must reinforce the climatological stationary wave, which corresponds to constructive linear interference between the anomalous wave and the climatological wave. It is shown that the lag in peak wave activity flux arises because the Rossby wave train associated with the snow cover is in quadrature or out of phase with the climatological stationary wave from October to mid-November.

abstract = {[1] The global climate models for the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth
Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) predict very different
changes of rainfall over the Amazon under the SRES
A1B scenario for global climate change. Five of the
eleven models predict an increase of annual
rainfall, three models predict a decrease of
rainfall, and the other three models predict no
significant changes in the Amazon rainfall. We have
further examined two models. The UKMO-HadCM3 model
predicts an El Nino-like sea surface temperature
(SST) change and warming in the northern tropical
Atlantic which appear to enhance atmospheric
subsidence and consequently reduce clouds over the
Amazon. The resultant increase of surface solar
absorption causes a stronger surface sensible heat
flux and thus reduces relative humidity of the
surface air. These changes decrease the rate and
length of wet season rainfall and surface latent
heat flux. This decreased wet season rainfall leads
to drier soil during the subsequent dry season,
which in turn can delay the transition from the dry
to wet season. GISS-ER predicts a weaker SST warming
in the western Pacific and the southern tropical
Atlantic which increases moisture transport and
hence rainfall in the Amazon. In the southern Amazon
and Nordeste where the strongest rainfall increase
occurs, the resultant higher soil moisture supports
a higher surface latent heat flux during the dry and
transition season and leads to an earlier wet season
onset.},

@article{dool03,
abstract = {We have conducted an experiment to assess the real
time skill in monthly and seasonal predictions based
solely on patterns of antecedent hydrological
information over the United States. The hydrological
information is contained in a proxy for soil
moisture at 102 locations over the lower 48
states. This soil moisture is calculated over the
years 1931 to present from a local hydrological
equation taking monthly precipitation (P) and
temperature (T) as input, and producing soil
moisture (w), evaporation (E), runoff (R), and loss
to groundwater (G) as output. The initial condition
(IC) for the forecast procedure is soil moisture
over the United States at the end of the month
(w30). We constructed an analogue to the w30 fields,
i.e., made linear combinations of soil moisture
fields at the same time of year in years past to
reproduce the IC to within a small tolerance. The
coefficients assigned to the years past are then
made to persist, and the subsequent development in
the historical years is linearly combined to form a
forecast. This method has been running at CPC in
real time since 1998, and we added 1981-1997 in
"retroactive real time" mode to form a large enough
sample. In total, we considered both seasonal and
monthly forecasts at leads of -1 to +6 months for
1981-2001, for the elements w30, E, T, and P. From
the outset, we wanted to investigate nonlocal
forecast methods, considering local effects, on
evaporation and temperature mainly, as being
established already and well documented [Huang et
al., 1996]. In a nonlocal method we entertain the
possibility of precipitation (the response) falling
downstream of a soil moisture anomaly (forcing). We
found that we have about a 0.6 correlation in
forecasting monthly soil moisture with a lead of one
month (i.e., July at the end of May). This figure is
higher in spring and somewhat lower in the early
fall. The capability to forecast evaporation
anomalies is very seasonal. During the cold half of
the year, when E anomalies resemble T anomalies, the
correlation is only 0.2-0.3, but in summer, when E
anomalies resemble w anomalies, the skill of
forecasts goes up to 0.6. We thus have some insight
into patterns of anomalous water vapor input from
the land surface into the lower atmosphere on a
continental scale. Skill of forecasting T is modest,
reaching 0.2-0.3 in many months and seasons, but
there is no clear seasonal dependence that relates
to the presumed physics of land atmosphere
interactions. Skill in forecasting P is quite low,
barely 0.1 in correlation, but +ve in all months and
seasons. We did alternative experiments where the
constructed analogue was built on E, T, or P instead
of w and verified the forecast of all elements
likewise. We found initial w to be the best for
forecasting w itself and indeed for forecasting the
other fields as well! This is important testimony
that soil moisture is indeed the key, as has been
suspected by many for ages.},

The review includes a synthesis of our knowledge regarding the main sources supplying moisture to the Arctic, the changes experienced over the last few decades due to variations in the transport of moisture, the factors that control interannual variability, and the inherent contrast in the mechanisms related to the effect of changes in moisture transport on SIE in the Arctic. We note that the precise identification of the moisture sources for the Arctic depends both on the definition of the Arctic region itself and on the approach used to identify the sources, with the remote regions over the extratropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans being universally important, as are some continental areas over Siberia and North America. This review also reaffirms the absence of any clear agreement regarding the trends in atmospheric moisture transport to the Arctic, and highlights discrepancies between different data sets and approaches in the quantification of moisture transport, implying that its long-term impact on the intensification of the hydrological cycle in the Arctic remains unclear. We confirm the influence of the major modes of climate variability, planetary circulation patterns, and the changes in cyclonic activity in the variability of moisture transport to the Arctic. We reaffirm that the effect of moisture transport on the Arctic SIE through changes in humidity, cloud cover, and precipitation over the Arctic is a complex scientific problem that requires further detailed study over the decades to come, and we propose some important challenges for future research.

abstract = {Singular systems (or singular spectrum) analysis
(SSA) was originally proposed for noise reduction in
the analysis of experimental data and is now
becoming widely used to identify intermittent or
modulated oscillations in geophysical and climatic
time series. Progress has been hindered by a lack of
effective statistical tests to discriminate between
potential oscillations and anything but the simplest
form of noise, that is, ''white'' (independent,
identically distributed) noise, in which power is
independent of frequency. The authors show how the
basic formalism of SSA provides a natural test for
modulated oscillations against an arbitrary
''colored noise'' null hypothesis. This test, Monte
Carlo SSA, is illustrated using synthetic data in
three situations: (i) where there is prior knowledge
of the power-spectral characteristics of the noise,
a situation expected in some laboratory and
engineering applications, or when the ''noise''
against which the data is being tested consists of
the output of an independently specified model, such
as a climate model; (ii) where a simple hypothetical
noise model is tested, namely, that the data
consists only of white or colored noise; and (iii)
where a composite. hypothetical noise model is
tested, assuming some deterministic components have
already been found in the data, such as a trend or
annual cycle, and it needs to be established whether
the remainder may be attributed to noise. The
authors examine two historical temperature records
and show that the strength of the evidence provided
by SSA for interannual and interdecadal climate
oscillations in such data has been considerably
overestimated. In contrast, multiple inter- and
subannual oscillatory components are identified in
an extended Southern Oscillation index at a high
significance level. The authors explore a number of
variations on the Monte Carlo SSA algorithm and note
that it is readily applicable to multivariate
series, covering standard empirical orthogonal
functions and multichannel SSA.},

abstract = {Seasonal transitions from winter to spring impact a wide variety of ecological and physical systems. While the effects of early springs across North America are widely documented, changes in their frequency and likelihood under the combined influences of climate change and natural variability are poorly understood. Extremely early springs, such as March 2012, can lead to severe economical losses and agricultural damage when these are followed by hard freeze events. Here we use the new Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble project and Extended Spring Indices to simulate historical and future spring onsets across the United States and in the particular the Great Lakes region. We found a marked increase in the frequency of March 2012-like springs by midcentury in addition to an overall trend towards earlier spring onsets, which nearly doubles that of observational records. However, changes in the date of last freeze do not occur at the same rate, therefore, causing a potential increase in the threat of plant tissue damage. Although large-scale climate modes, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, have previously dominated decadal to multidecadal spring onset trends, our results indicate a decreased role in natural climate variability and hence a greater forced response by the end of the century for modulating trends. Without a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, our study suggests that years like 2012 in the US could become normal by mid-century.},

The models were forced by historical emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for the 1850–2100 time period. For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The high...},

abstract = {The decline of Arctic sea ice is an integral part of anthropogenic climate change. Sea-ice loss is already having a significant impact on Arctic communities and ecosystems. Its role as a cause of climate changes outside of the Arctic has also attracted much scientific interest. Evidence is mounting that Arctic sea-ice loss can affect weather and climate throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The remote impacts of Arctic sea-ice loss can only be properly represented using models that simulate interactions among the ocean, sea ice, land and atmosphere. A synthesis of six such experiments with different models shows consistent hemispheric-wide atmospheric warming, strongest in the mid-to-high-latitude lower troposphere; an intensification of the wintertime Aleutian Low and, in most cases, the Siberian High; a weakening of the Icelandic Low; and a reduction in strength and southward shift of the mid-latitude westerly winds in winter. The atmospheric circulation response seems to be sensitive to the magnitude and geographic pattern of sea-ice loss and, in some cases, to the background climate state. However, it is unclear whether current-generation climate models respond too weakly to sea-ice change. We advocate for coordinated experiments that use different models and observational constraints to quantify the climate response to Arctic sea-ice loss.},

abstract = {A lower-bound on the uncertainty in observational estimates of the aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE, the direct interaction with solar radiation by all aerosols), and the aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF, the radiative effect of just anthropogenic aerosols, RFari), is quantified by making the optimistic assumption that global aerosol observations can be made with the accuracy found in the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun photometer retrievals. The global mean all-sky aerosol DRE uncertainty was found to be 1.1 Wm-2 (1 standard deviation). The global mean all-sky aerosol DRF (RFari) uncertainty was determined to be 0.31 Wm-2. The total uncertainty in both quantities is dominated by contributions from the aerosol single scattering albedo uncertainty. These uncertainty estimates were compared to a literature survey of mostly satellite-based aerosol DRE/DRF values. Comparisons to previous studies reveal that most have significantly underestimated the aerosol DRE uncertainty. Past estimates of the aerosol DRF uncertainty are smaller (on average) than our optimistic observational estimates, including the aerosol DRF uncertainty given in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report (AR5). This disconnect between our observation-based uncertainty and that found in past aerosol DRF studies that rely, at least in part, on modeling is discussed. Also quantified is a potential reduction in the current observational uncertainty possible with a future generation of satellite observations that would leverage aerosol typing and more refined vertical information.},

To explore the predictability of temporary slowdowns in decadal warming, we apply an artificial neural network (ANN) to climate model data from the Community Earth System Model Version 2 Large Ensemble. Here, an ANN is tasked with whether or not there will be a slowdown in the rate of the GMST trend by using maps of ocean heat content at the onset. Through a machine learning explainability method, we find the ANN is learning off-equatorial patterns of anomalous ocean heat content that resemble transitions in the phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in order to make slowdown predictions. Finally, we test our ANN on observed historical data, which further reveals how explainable neural networks are useful tools for understanding decadal variability in both climate models and observations.},

Coupled Model Intercomparison Project archives typically provide only a few ensemble members per model, rendering it difficult to quantify reducible model structural uncertainty and irreducible internal variability (IV) in projections. We estimate using the Multimodel Large Ensemble Archive that model structural differences explain two-thirds of the spread in late 21st century (2080–2099) projections of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This estimate is biased by systematic model errors in the forced NAO response and IV. Across the North Atlantic, the NAO explains a substantial fraction of the spread in mean sea level pressure (MSLP) projections due to IV, except in the central North Atlantic. Conversely, the spread in North Atlantic MSLP projections associated with model differences is largely unexplained by the NAO. Therefore, improving understanding of the NAO alone may not constrain the reducible uncertainty in North Atlantic MSLP projections.},

abstract = {This Review considers recent advances in our understanding of regional climate change, critically discusses outstanding issues, and recommends targets for future research. Regional information on climate change is urgently needed but often deemed unreliable. To achieve credible regional climate projections, it is essential to understand underlying physical processes, reduce model biases and evaluate their impact on projections, and adequately account for internal variability. In the tropics, where atmospheric internal variability is small compared with the forced change, advancing our understanding of the coupling between long-term changes in upper-ocean temperature and the atmospheric circulation will help most to narrow the uncertainty. In the extratropics, relatively large internal variability introduces substantial uncertainty, while exacerbating risks associated with extreme events. Large ensemble simulations are essential to estimate the probabilistic distribution of climate change on regional scales. Regional models inherit atmospheric circulation uncertainty from global models and do not automatically solve the problem of regional climate change. We conclude that the current priority is to understand and reduce uncertainties on scales greater than 100 km to aid assessments at finer scales.},

The pace of Arctic warming is two-to-three times that of the globe; this disparity reached a new record high during 2016. While the Arctic spans only a small fraction of the Earth, it plays a disproportionate and multifaceted role in the climate system. In this article, we offer new perspectives on ways in which the Arctic's rapid warming may influence weather patterns in heavily populated regions (the mid-latitudes) of the Northern Hemisphere. Research on this topic has evolved almost as rapidly as the snow and ice have diminished, and while much has been learned, many questions remain. The atmosphere is complex, highly variable, and undergoing a multitude of simultaneous changes, many of which have become apparent only recently. These realities present challenges to robust signal detection and to clear attribution of cause-and-effect. In addition to updating the state of this science, we propose an explanation for the varying and intermittent response of mid-latitude circulation to the rapidly warming Arctic.

abstract = {During the early Pliocene, 5 to 3 million years ago,
globally averaged temperatures were substantially
higher than they are today, even though the external
factors that determine climate were essentially the
same. In the tropics, El Nino was continual (or
"permanent'') rather than intermittent. The
appearance of northern continental glaciers, and of
cold surface waters in oceanic upwelling zones in
low latitudes (both coastal and equatorial),
signaled the termination of those warm climate
conditions and the end of permanent El Nino. This
led to the amplification of obliquity (but not
precession) cycles in equatorial sea surface
temperatures and in global ice volume, with the
former leading the latter by several thousand
years. A possible explanation is that the gradual
shoaling of the oceanic thermocline reached a
threshold around 3 million years ago, when the winds
started bringing cold waters to the surface in low
latitudes. This introduced feedbacks involving
ocean-atmosphere interactions that, along with
ice-albedo feedbacks, amplified obliquity cycles. A
future melting of glaciers, changes in the
hydrological cycle, and a deepening of the
thermocline could restore the warm conditions of the
early Pliocene.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Atmospheric reanalyses can be useful tools for examining climate variability and change; however, they must be used cautiously because of time-varying biases that can induce artificial trends. This study explicitly documents a discontinuity in the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) that leads to significantly exaggerated warming in the Arctic mid- to lower troposphere, and demonstrates that the continuing use of ERA-40 to study Arctic temperature trends is problematic. The discontinuity occurs in 1997 in response to refined processing of satellite radiances prior to their assimilation into the reanalysis model. It is clearly apparent in comparisons of ERA-40 output against satellite-derived air temperatures, in situ observations, and alternative reanalyses. Decadal or multidecadal Arctic temperature trends calculated over periods that include 1997 are highly inaccurate, particularly below 600 hPa. It is shown that ERA-40 is poorly suited to studying Arctic temperature trends and their vertical profile, and conclusions based upon them must be viewed with extreme caution. Consequently, its future use for this purpose is discouraged. In the context of the wider scientific debate on the suitability of reanalyses for trend analyses, the results show that a series of alternative reanalyses are in broad-scale agreement with observations. Thus, the authors encourage their discerning use instead of ERA-40 for examining Arctic climate change while also reaffirming the importance of verifying reanalyses with observations whenever possible.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosol emissions are predicted to decline sharply throughout the 21st century, in line with climate change and air quality mitigation policies, causing a near-term warming of climate that will impact our trajectory towards 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures. However, the persistent uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing limits our understanding of how much the global mean temperature will respond to near-term reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions. We quantify the model and scenario uncertainty in global mean aerosol radiative forcing up to 2050 using statistical emulation of a perturbed parameter ensemble for emission reduction scenarios consistent with three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. We then use a simple climate model to translate the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing into uncertainty in global mean temperature projections, accounting additionally for the potential correlation of aerosol radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. Near-term aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty alone causes an uncertainty window of around 5 years (2034-2039) on the projected year of exceeding a global temperature rise of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures for a middle of the road emissions scenario (SSP2-RCP4.5). A correlation between aerosol radiative forcing and climate sensitivity would increase the 1.5 °C exceedance window by many years. The results highlight the importance of quantifying aerosol radiative forcing and any relationship with climate sensitivity in climate models in order to reduce uncertainty in temperature projections.},

abstract = {Arctic amplification (AA) is a coupled atmosphere-sea ice-ocean process. This understanding has evolved from the early concept of AA, as a consequence of snow-ice line progressions, through more than a century of research that has clarified the relevant processes and driving mechanisms of AA. The predictions made by early modeling studies, namely the fall/winter maximum, bottom-heavy structure, the prominence of surface albedo feedback, and the importance of stable stratification have withstood the scrutiny of multi-decadal observations and more complex models. Yet, the uncertainty in Arctic climate projections is larger than in any other region of the planet, making the assessment of high-impact, near-term regional changes difficult or impossible. Reducing this large spread in Arctic climate projections requires a quantitative process understanding. This manuscript aims to build such an understanding by synthesizing current knowledge of AA and to produce a set of recommendations to guide future research. It briefly reviews the history of AA science, summarizes observed Arctic changes, discusses modeling approaches and feedback diagnostics, and assesses the current understanding of the most relevant feedbacks to AA. These sections culminate in a conceptual model of the fundamental physical mechanisms causing AA and a collection of recommendations to accelerate progress towards reduced uncertainty in Arctic climate projections. Our conceptual model highlights the need to account for local feedback and remote process interactions within the context of the annual cycle to constrain projected AA. We recommend raising the priority of Arctic climate sensitivity research, improving the accuracy of Arctic surface energy budget observations, rethinking climate feedback definitions, coordinating new model experiments and intercomparisons, and further investigating the role of episodic variability in AA.},

abstract = {AbstractThroughout much of the latter half of the twentieth century, the dominant mode of Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropical wintertime circulation variability—the Arctic Oscillation (AO)—exhibited a positive trend, with decreasing high-latitude sea level pressure (SLP) and increasing midlatitude SLP. General circulation models (GCMs) show that this trend is related to several factors, including North Atlantic SSTs, greenhouse gas/ozone-induced stratospheric cooling, and warming of the Indo-Pacific warm pool. Over the last approximately two decades, however, the AO has been decreasing, with 2009/10 featuring the most negative AO since 1900. Observational and idealized modeling studies suggest that snow cover, particularly over Eurasia, may be important. An observed snow–AO mechanism also exists, involving the vertical propagation of a Rossby wave train into the stratosphere, which induces a negative AO response that couples to the troposphere. Similar to other GCMs, the authors show that transient sim...},

abstract = {Various geochemical tracers measured in massive
coral skeletons have the potential to compliment
other sources of high-resolution proxy climate
information (e.g. tree rings, ice cores) by
providing paleoclimatic data from shallow-water
tropical ocean regions. Twenty previously published
coral records (19 delta(18)O and one Sr/Ca series),
between 54 and 346 years in length, were examined
for their local and larger-scale relationships (El
Nino-Southern Oscillation) with climate. Series were
examined in a consistent manner over the same time
periods and relationships were tested for stability
through time. The results demonstrate a spectrum of
climatic interpretation ranging from (1) no
significant relationship of the coral record with
either local or larger-scale climate variables, (2)
significant relationship of the coral record with
climate but the relationship is not stable through
time, and (3) the coral record shows a significant
and temporally stable relationship with climate
which explains a significant and useful proportion
of climate variance. It is concluded that reliance,
to date, on analyzing only one long coral core from
a site has prevented identification of coral records
or parts of coral records where non-climatic factors
are dominating the geochemical signal. Various
factors may cause these non-climatic signals to
dominate. More process studies into how corals of
particular species, with various growth rates and
from various environmental settings incorporate
geochemical tracers into their skeleton are required
to understand exactly what is being measured. In
addition, it is recommended that some level of
replication (ideally, three separate corals) of
geochemical tracers will ensure accurate dating of
the record, identification of periods when
non-climatic factors dominate and thus enhance the
reliability of the paleoclimatic record. Such an
approach will allow the rich archive of
environmental information contained in massive coral
skeletons to make a significant contribution to
high-resolution paleoclimatology and improve our
understanding of the nature and causes of past
climate variability. Crown Copyright (C) 2003

Nearly all models project an amplification and a phase delay of the annual cycle for both quantities, indicating a greater annual range and extrema reached later in the year. The authors investigate the nature of the seasonal precipitation changes in AGCM experiments forced by SST perturbations, which represent idealizations of the changes in annual mean, amplitude, and phase as simulated by CMIP5 models. A uniform SST warming is sufficient to force both amplification and a delay of the annual cycle of precipitation. The amplification is due to an increase in the annual mean vertical water vapor gradient, while the delay is affected by changes in the seasonality of the circulation. A budget analysis of this simulation reveals a large degree of similarity with the CMIP5 results. In...},

abstract = {The current consensus is that drought has developed
in the Sahel during the second half of the twentieth
century as a result of remote effects of oceanic
anomalies amplified by local land-atmosphere
interactions. This paper focuses on the impacts of
oceanic anomalies upon West African climate and
specifically aims to identify those from SST
anomalies in the Pacific/Indian Oceans during spring
and summer seasons, when they were
significant. Idealized sensitivity experiments are
performed with four atmospheric general circulation
models (AGCMs). The prescribed SST patterns used in
the AGCMs are based on the leading mode of
covariability between SST anomalies over the
Pacific/Indian Oceans and summer rainfall over West
Africa. The results show that such oceanic anomalies
in the Pacific/Indian Ocean lead to a northward
shift of an anomalous dry belt from the Gulf of
Guinea to the Sahel as the season advances. In the
Sahel, the magnitude of rainfall anomalies is
comparable to that obtained by other authors using
SST anomalies confined to the proximity of the
Atlantic Ocean. The mechanism connecting the
Pacific/Indian SST anomalies with West African
rainfall has a strong seasonal cycle. In spring (May
and June), anomalous subsidence develops over both
the Maritime Continent and the equatorial Atlantic
in response to the enhanced equatorial
heating. Precipitation increases over continental
West Africa in association with stronger zonal
convergence of moisture. In addition, precipitation
decreases over the Gulf of Guinea. During the
monsoon peak (July and August), the SST anomalies
move westward over the equatorial Pacific and the
two regions where subsidence occurred earlier in the
seasons merge over West Africa. The monsoon weakens
and rainfall decreases over the Sahel, especially in
August.},

abstract = {Several North American broad-leaved tree species
range from the northern United States at similar to
47 degrees N to moist tropical montane forests in
Mexico and Central America at 15-20 degrees N. Along
this gradient the average minimum temperatures of
the coldest month (T (Jan)), which characterize
annual variation in temperature, increase from -10
to 12 degrees C and tree phenology changes from
deciduous to leaf-exchanging or evergreen in the
southern range with a year-long growing
season. Between 30 and 45 degrees N, the time of bud
break is highly correlated with T (Jan) and bud
break can be reliably predicted for the week in
which mean minimum temperature rises to 7 degrees
C. Temperature-dependent deciduous phenology-and
hence the validity of temperature-driven phenology
models-terminates in southern North America near 30
degrees N, where T (Jan){\textgreater} 7 degrees C enables growth
of tropical trees and cultivation of frost-sensitive
citrus fruits. In tropical climates most temperate
broad-leaved species exchange old for new leaves
within a few weeks in January-February, i.e., their
phenology becomes similar to that of tropical
leaf-exchanging species. Leaf buds of the southern
ecotypes of these temperate species are therefore
not winter-dormant and have no chilling
requirement. As in many tropical trees, bud break of
Celtis, Quercus and Fagus growing in warm climates
is induced in early spring by increasing
daylength. In tropical climates vegetative phenology
is determined mainly by leaf longevity, seasonal
variation in water stress and day length. As water
stress during the dry season varies widely with soil
water storage, climate-driven models cannot predict
tree phenology in the tropics and tropical tree
phenology does not constitute a useful indicator of
global warming.},

abstract = {During the 2012–2013 winter, the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) predominated, resulting in a cold winter over Europe and northern Asia punctuated by episodes of frigid weather. This climate anomaly is part of a recent trend towards negative values of the NAO index that has occurred over recent winters. The negative trend of the NAO may be related to atmospheric internal variability but it may also be partly forced by slowly varying components of the climate system. In the present study, we investigate the influence of surface conditions on the atmospheric circulation for the 2012–2013 winter using an atmospheric global climate model. In particular, the role of low Arctic sea ice concentration, warm tropical/North Atlantic sea surface temperature and positive Siberian snow cover anomalies are isolated by prescribing them in a set of different numerical experiments. Our simulations suggest that each of these surface forcings favored a negative NAO during the 2012–2013 winter. In our model, the combined NAO response to tropical/North Atlantic SST, Arctic sea ice and Siberian snow anomalies accounts for about 30 {\%} of the observed NAO anomaly. Different physical mechanisms are explored to elucidate the atmospheric responses and are shown to involve both tropical and extratropical processes.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen substantial advances in understanding Arctic amplification — that trends and variability in surface air temperature tend to be larger in the Arctic region than for the Northern Hemisphere or globe as a whole. We provide a synthesis of research on Arctic amplification, starting with a historical context and then addressing recent insights into processes and key impacts, based on analysis of the instrumental record, modeling studies, and paleoclimate reconstructions. Arctic amplification is now recognized as an inherent characteristic of the global climate system, with multiple intertwined causes operating on a spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. These include, but are not limited to, changes in sea ice extent that impact heat fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere, atmospheric and oceanic heat transports, cloud cover and water vapor that alter the longwave radiation flux to the surface, soot on snow and heightened black carbon aerosol concentrations. Strong warming over the Arctic Ocean during the past decade in autumn and winter, clearly associated with reduced sea ice extent, is but the most recent manifestation of the phenomenon. Indeed, periods of Arctic amplification are evident from analysis of both warm and cool periods over at least the past three million years. Arctic amplification being observed today is expected to become stronger in coming decades, invoking changes in atmospheric circulation, vegetation and the carbon cycle, with impacts both within and beyond the Arctic.},

abstract = {This paper examines farmer intentions to adapt to global climate change by analyzing responses to a climate change scenario presented in a survey given to large-scale farmers (n = 4778) across the US Corn Belt in 2012. Adaptive strategies are evaluated in the context of decision making and farmers' intention to increase their use of three production practices promoted across the Corn Belt: no-till farming, cover crops, and tile drainage. This paper also provides a novel conceptual framework that bridges a typology of adaptation with concepts that help predict intentionality in behavior change models. This conceptual framework was developed to facilitate examination of adaptive decision making in the context of agriculture. This research effort examines key factors that influence farmers' intentions to increase their use of the practices evaluated given a climate change scenario. Twenty-two covariates are examined across three models developed for no-till farming, cover crops, and tile drainage. Findings highlight that farmers who believed they should adjust their practices to protect their farm from the negative impacts of increased weather variability were more likely to indicate that they would increase their use of each of the practices in response to climate change. Additionally, visiting with other farmers to observe their practices was positively associated with farmers' intentions to increase their use of the adaptive strategies examined. Farmers who were currently using no-till farming, cover crops, and tile drainage were also more likely to plan to increase their use of these practices in response to increased weather variability associated with climate change. However, farmers who reported high levels of confidence in their current practices were less likely to plan on changing their use of these practices in response to climatic changes.},

abstract = {This study uses meteorological records from Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs) to estimate the performance of global reanalysis products for monthly air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). These products include the fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5), ECMWF Interim Reanalysis (ERAI), Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), Climate Forecast System Reanalysis Version 1/Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSRv1/CFSRv2), and Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55). The global reanalysis products generally perform better in summer than in winter, and their qualities vary by glaciological regime. No reanalysis is clearly identified as the optimal dataset for all meteorological parameters, seasons and regions. For all reanalyses, warm biases are observed in the accumulation zone, but cold biases are observed in the ablation area of the GrIS. ERAI, ERA5 and JRA-55 underestimate relative humidity during any month. While MERRA-2 overestimates wind speeds, underestimates are found for the other reanalyses excluding JRA-55 during all months. Despite the robust agreement between the AWS time series for all three variables and each reanalysis product averaged over the ice sheet, sudden jumps occur in annual mean wind speed in CFSR, and in annual relative humidity in JRA-55 from 2010 to 2011.},

abstract = {This paper presents characteristics of droughts
simulated by global climate models (GCMs) under
enhanced greenhouse gases conditions. We used a
drought index called the Reconnaissance Drought
Index (RDI) which takes both rainfall and potential
evapotranspiration into account to investigate
variations of droughts among 12 regions in
Australia. The RDI was applied to simulated climate
variables from 14 GCMs performed for the IPCC 4th
Assessment Report. The results show a general
increase in drought areal extent and/or frequency
for most regions. However, the increases are not
significant over the North West, North Queensland,
Queensland East Coast and Central Queensland. For
most regions, the change beyond 2030 is larger than
that prior to 2030. but the uncertainty in the
projections also increases with time. By 2030, there
is a likely ({\textgreater} 66{\%} probability) risk of twice or
more drought affected area and/or twice as often
drought frequency over South West Western
Australia. By 2050, this will include the
Murray-Darling Basin, South Australia and Victoria,
and by 2070 this will extend to New South Wales and
Tasmania. For North Queensland such a risk is
unlikely ({\textless} 33{\%} probability) for the next 100
years. This information can be considered indicative
in long-term planning focussing on

an environmental change unprecedented in
millennia. The high growth is not overestimated
because of standardization techniques, and it is
unlikely that it is a result of a change in tree
growth form or that it is predominantly caused by
CO2 fertilization. The growth surge has occurred
only in a limited elevational band within
approximate to 150 m of upper treeline, regardless
of treeline elevation. Both an independent proxy

meteorological temperature data are positively and
significantly correlated with upper-treeline ring

Similar characteristics are investigated in the indices of both MPI-ESM1.1 and CESM1 ensemble models. The results further indicate no statistically significant lead-lag correlations between the unforced multidecadal climate modes originating from North Pacific (e.g., PDO) and North Atlantic (e.g., AMO), suggesting that a high correlation found in previous observational studies may be due to biased detrending approaches.},

abstract = {West Africa includes a semi-arid zone between the
Sahara Desert and the humid Gulf of Guinea coast,
approximately between 10 degrees N and 20 degrees N,
which is irrigated by summer monsoon rains. This
article refers to the region as the Sahel. Rain-fed
agriculture is the primary sustenance for Sahel
populations, and severe droughts (in the 1970s and
1980s), therefore, have devastating negative
societal impacts. The future frequency of Sahel
droughts and the evolution of its hydrological
balance are therefore of great interest. The article
reviews 10 recent research studies that attempt to
discover how climate changes will affect the
hydrology of the Sahel throughout the 21st
century. All 10 studies rely on atmosphere-ocean
global climate model (AOGCM) simulations based on a
range of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Many of
the simulations are contained in the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change archives
for Assessment Reports {\#}3 and {\#}4. Two of the studies
use AOGCM data to drive regional climate
models. Seven studies make projections for the first
half of the 21st century and eight studies make
projections for the second half. Some studies make
projections of wetter conditions and some predict
more frequent droughts, and each describes the
atmospheric processes associated with its
prediction. Only one study projects more frequent
droughts before 2050, and that is only for
continent-wide degradation in vegetation cover. The
challenge to correctly simulate Sahel rainfall
decadal trends is particularly daunting because
multiple physical mechanisms compete to drive the
trend upwards or downwards. A variety of model
deficiencies, regarding the simulation of one or
more of these physical processes, taints models'
climate change projections. Consequently, no
consensus emerges regarding the impact of
anticipated greenhouse gas forcing on the hydrology
of the Sahel in the second half of the 21st

The first harmonic is associated with maximum global AAM in winter (December– January–February) and minimum in summer, but the second harmonic is important enough to produce a distinct secondary midwinter minimum. Locally, the second harmonic has largest amplitude in the Tropics and subtropics of the upper troposphere. At present, little is known concerning the fundamental cause of this semiannual variation. The problem is investigated here by focusing on the upper-tropospheric winds, whose angular momentum is an excellent proxy of global AAM. The annual variation of the rotational part of these winds (the part that contributes to the global AAM) is diagnosed in a nonlinear upper-tropospheric vorticity-equation model with specified horizontal wind divergence and transient-eddy forcing. The divergence forcing is the more important of the two, especially in the Tropics and sub...},

surface heat fluxes, surface currents, Equatorial

well captured by the models. Some biases are
evident, including a cold SST bias along the
equator, a warm bias along the coast of South
America, and a westward extension of the trade winds
relative to observations. Along the equator, the
models exhibit a robust, westward-propagating annual
cycle of SST and zonal winds. During boreal spring,
excessive rainfall south of the equator is linked to
an unrealistic reversal of the simulated meridional
winds in the east, and a stronger-than-observed
semiannual signal is evident in the zonal winds and
Equatorial Undercurrent. Both CM2.0 and CM2.1 have
a robust ENSO with multidecadal fluctuations in
amplitude, an irregular period between 2 and 5 yr,
and a distribution of SST anomalies that is skewed
toward warm events as observed. The evolution of
subsurface temperature and current anomalies is also
quite realistic. However, the simulated SST
anomalies are too strong, too weakly damped by
surface heat fluxes, and not as clearly phase locked
to the end of the calendar year as in
observations. The simulated patterns of tropical
Pacific SST, wind stress, and precipitation
variability are displaced 20 degrees-30 degrees west
of the observed patterns, as are the simulated ENSO
teleconnections to wintertime 200-hPa heights over
Canada and the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Despite
this, the impacts of ENSO on summertime and
wintertime precipitation outside the tropical

abstract = {Based upon the climate feedback-responses analysis method, a quantitative attribution analysis is conducted for the annual-mean surface temperature biases in the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). Surface temperature biases are decomposed into partial temperature biases associated with model biases in albedo, water vapor, cloud, sensible/latent heat flux, surface dynamics, and atmospheric dynamics. A globally-averaged cold bias of −1.22 K in CESM1 is largely attributable to albedo bias that accounts for approximately −0.80 K. Over land, albedo bias contributes −1.20 K to the averaged cold bias of −1.45 K. The cold bias over ocean, on the other hand, results from multiple factors including albedo, cloud, oceanic dynamics, and atmospheric dynamics. Bias in the model representation of oceanic dynamics is the primary cause of cold (warm) biases in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere oceans while surface latent heat flux over oceans always acts to compensate for the overall temperature biases. Albedo bias resulted from the model's simulation of snow cover and sea ice is the main contributor to temperature biases over high-latitude lands and the Arctic and Antarctic region. Longwave effect of water vapor is responsible for an overall warm (cold) bias in the subtropics (tropics) due to an overestimate (underestimate) of specific humidity in the region. Cloud forcing of temperature biases exhibits large regional variations and the model bias in the simulated ocean mixed layer depth is a key contributor to the partial sea surface temperature biases associated with oceanic dynamics. On a global scale, biases in the model representation of radiative processes account more for surface temperature biases compared to non-radiative, dynamical processes.},

abstract = {This study elucidates the physical mechanisms underlying internal and forced components of winter surface air temperature (SAT) trends over North America during the past 50 years (1963-2012) using a combined observational and modeling framework. The modeling framework consists of 30 simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) at 1° latitude-longitude resolution, each of which is subject to an identical scenario of historical radiative forcing but starts from a slightly different atmospheric state. Hence, any spread within the ensemble results from unpredictable internal variability superimposed upon the forced climate change signal. Constructed atmospheric circulation analogs are used to estimate the dynamical contribution to forced and internal components of SAT trends: Thermodynamic contributions are obtained as a residual. Internal circulation trends are estimated to account for approximately one-third of the observed wintertime warming trend over North America and more than half locally over parts of Canada and the United States. Removing the effects of internal atmospheric circulation variability narrows the spread of SAT trends within the CESM ensemble and brings the observed trends closer to the model's radiatively forced response. In addition, removing internal dynamics approximately doubles the signal-to-noise ratio of the simulated SAT trends and substantially advances the "time of emergence" of the forced component of SAT anomalies. The methodological framework proposed here provides a general template for improving physical understanding and interpretation of observed and simulated climate trends worldwide and may help to reconcile the diversity of SAT trends across the models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5).},

abstract = {We reconstructed the late-Holocene surface-moisture
history and vegetation dynamics of a raised bog in
Michigan using testate amoebae, peat humification,
pollen, stomata and plant macrofossils. Our primary
objective was to compare bog palaeohydrology with
the water-level history of Lake Michigan, and to
regional and local vegetation changes. Hydrologic
histories inferred from testate amoebae and
humification show similar trends, and correspond
with records of past water-level variability in Lake
Michigan. The bog clearly shows effective-moisture
increases during the Algoma highstand (similar
to3200-2300 cal. BP) and a later unnamed highstand
(similar to1900-1300 cal. BP). Some higher-frequency
fluctuations are also similar. The good
correspondence indicates that bog hydrology and the
water levels of Lake Michigan have been driven by
changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation
patterns for at least the past 3500 years. Climate
during the Algoma highstand may have been
spatiotemporally complex, with increasing moisture
occurring several hundred years earlier in the
northern portion of the western Great Lakes
basin. Locally, the expansion and contraction of
Picea populations on the bog surface was probably
directly related to moisture conditions. The
well-documented decline in Fagus populations in the
central Great Lakes region after 1000 cal. BP is
contemporaneous with a major shift towards drier
conditions, suggesting that relative dryness caused
the decline.},

abstract = {The Arctic has warmed more than twice as fast as the global average since the mid 20th century, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification (AA). These profound changes to the Arctic system have coincided with a period of ostensibly more frequent events of extreme weather across the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes, including extreme heat and rainfall events and recent severe winters. Though winter temperatures have generally warmed since 1960 over mid-to-high latitudes, the acceleration in the rate of warming at high-latitudes, relative to the rest of the NH, started approximately in 1990. Trends since 1990 show cooling over the NH continents, especially in Northern Eurasia. The possible link between Arctic change and mid-latitude climate and weather has spurred a rush of new observational and modeling studies. A number of workshops held during 2013-2014 have helped frame the problem and have called for continuing and enhancing efforts for improving our understanding of Arctic-mid-latitude linkages and its attribution to the occurrence of extreme climate and weather events. Although these workshops have outlined some of the major challenges and provided broad recommendations, further efforts are needed to synthesize the diversified research results to identify where community consensus and gaps exist. Building upon findings and recommendations of the previous workshops, the US CLIVAR Working Group on Arctic Change and Possible Influence on Mid-latitude Climate and Weather convened an international workshop at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, on February 1-3, 2017. Experts in the fields of atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere sciences assembled to assess the rapidly evolving state of understanding, identify consensus on knowledge and gaps in research, and develop specific actions to accelerate progress within the research community. With more than 100 participants, the workshop was the largest and most comprehensive gathering of climate scientists to address the topic to date. In this white paper, we synthesize and discuss outcomes from this workshop and activities involving many of the working group members.},

abstract = {The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) has been
widely used to study aridity changes in modern and
past climates. Efforts to address its major problems
have led to new variants of the PDSI, such as the
self-calibrating PDSI (sc{\_}PDSI) and PDSI using
improved formulations for potential
evapotranspiration (PE), such as the Penman-Monteith
equation (PE{\_}pm) instead of the Thornthwaite
equation (PE{\_}th). Here I compare and evaluate four
forms of the PDSI, namely, the PDSI with PE{\_}th
(PDSI{\_}th) and PE{\_}pm (PDSI{\_}pm) and the sc{\_}PDSI with
PE{\_}th (sc{\_}PDSI{\_}th) and PE{\_}pm (sc{\_}PDSI{\_}pm) calculated
using available climate data from 1850 to 2008. Our
results confirm previous findings that the choice of
the PE only has small effects on both the PDSI and
sc{\_}PDSI for the 20th century climate, and the
self-calibration reduces the value range slightly
and makes the sc{\_}PDSI more comparable spatially than
the original PDSI. However, the histograms of the
sc{\_}PDSI are still non-Gaussian at many locations,
and all four forms of the PDSI show similar
correlations with observed monthly soil moisture (r
= 0.4-0.8) in North America and Eurasia, with
historical yearly streamflow data (r = 0.4-0.9) over
most of the world's largest river basins, and with
GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment)
satellite-observed water storage changes (r =
0.4-0.8) over most land areas. All the four forms of
the PDSI show widespread drying over Africa, East
and South Asia, and other areas from 1950 to 2008,
and most of this drying is due to recent
warming. The global percentage of dry areas has
increased by about 1.74{\%} (of global land area) per
decade from 1950 to 2008. The use of the
Penman-Monteith PE and self-calibrating PDSI only
slightly reduces the drying trend seen in the
original PDSI. The percentages of dry and wet areas
over the global land area and six select regions are
anticorrelated (r = -0.5 to -0.7), but their
long-term trends during the 20th century do not
cancel each other, with the trend for the dry area
often predominating over that for the wet area,
resulting in upward trends during the 20th century
for the areas under extreme (i.e., dry or wet)
conditions for the global land as a whole (similar
to 1.27{\%} per decade) and the United States, western
Europe, Australia, Sahel, East Asia, and southern
Africa. The recent drying trends are qualitatively
consistent with other analyses and model
predictions, which suggest more severe drying in the
coming decades.},

Data-driven causal inference in such systems is challenging since datasets are often high dimensional and nonlinear with limited sample sizes. Here, we introduce a novel method that flexibly combines linear or nonlinear conditional independence tests with a causal discovery algorithm to estimate causal networks from large-scale time series datasets. We validate the method on time series of well-understood physical mechanisms in the climate system and the human heart and using large-scale synthetic datasets mimicking the typical properties of real-world data. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detection power, which opens up entirely new possibilities to discover and quantify causal networks from time series across a range of research fields.},

abstract = {Southern California and much of the western United
States face a chronic challenge of limited water
supply due to high potential evaporation and low
precipitation coupled with frequent
droughts. Mitigation approaches include the use of
ground water, reliance on water from river systems
fed by mountainous regions that have relatively high
precipitation, and the construction of extensive
aqueduct and water storage systems. In southern
California the present infrastructure is capable of
insulating large water districts against the typical
annual and multi-annual droughts experienced over
the past 100 years. However, paleoclimatic records
indicate that the region is also prone to much
longer droughts, including a prolonged episode of
generally and conditions and severe droughts
extending from the 9th through 14th centuries. This
period is sometimes referred to as the medieval
climate anomaly. Archaeological evidence suggests
that prehistoric populations such as the Anasazi in
the Southwest and the Chumash in southern California
were impacted by mega-drought conditions during the
medieval climate anomaly. These groups appear to
have displayed a variety of responses-ranging from
increased violence and the abandonment of some
regions, to the development of greater cultural
complexity and material
infrastructure. Paleoclimatological and
paleooceanographic data indicate that the and
conditions in western North America during the
medieval climate anomaly were produced by the
prolonged occurrence of cool surface waters in the
eastern Pacific. Recent climate model experiments
suggest relatively small increases in insolation and
decreases in atmospheric volcanic emission
concentrations can trigger such depressions of
eastern Pacific temperatures. It is thus possible
that a similar event could occur in the future due
to natural or anthropogenic causes. (c) 2007

abstract = {Using a climate model of intermediate complexity, we
simulate the response of the El Ni (n) over
tildeo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system to solar
and orbital forcing over the Holocene. Solar forcing
is reconstructed from radiocarbon production rate
data, using various scaling factors to account for
the conflicting estimates of solar irradiance
variability. As estimates of the difference since
the Maunder Minimum range from 0.05{\%} to 0.5{\%} of the
solar "constant,'' we consider these two extreme
scenarios, along with the intermediate case of
0.2{\%}. We show that for large or moderate forcings,
the low-pass-filtered east-west sea surface
temperature gradient along the equator responds
almost linearly to irradiance forcing, with a short
phase lag (about a decade). Wavelet analysis shows a
statistically significant enhancement of the
century-to-millennial-scale ENSO variability for
even a moderate irradiance forcing. In contrast, the
0.05{\%} case displays no such enhancement. Orbitally
driven insolation forcing is found to produce a
long-term increase of ENSO variability from the
early Holocene onward, in accordance with previous
findings. When both forcings are combined, the
superposition is approximately linear in the strong
scaling case. Overall, the sea surface temperature
response is of the magnitude required, and is
persistent enough, to induce important climatic
perturbations worldwide. The results suggest that
ENSO may plausibly have acted as a mediator between
the Sun and the Earth's climate. A comparison to key
Holocene climate records, from the Northern
Hemisphere subtropics and midlatitudes, shows
support for this hypothesis.},

abstract = {Arctic warming was more pronounced than warming in midlatitudes in the last decades making this region a hotspot of climate change. Associated with this, a rapid decline of sea-ice extent and a decrease of its thickness has been observed. Sea-ice retreat allows for an increased transport of heat and momentum from the ocean up to the tropo- and stratosphere by enhanced upward propagation of planetary-scale atmospheric waves. In the upper atmosphere, these waves deposit the momentum transported, disturbing the stratospheric polar vortex, which can lead to a breakdown of this circulation with the potential to also significantly impact the troposphere in mid- to late-winter and early spring. Therefore, an accurate representation of stratospheric processes in climate models is necessary to improve the understanding of the impact of retreating sea ice on the atmospheric circulation. By modeling the atmospheric response to a prescribed decline in Arctic sea ice, we show that including interactive stratospheric ozone chemistry in atmospheric model calculations leads to an improvement in tropo-stratospheric interactions compared to simulations without interactive chemistry. This suggests that stratospheric ozone chemistry is important for the understanding of sea ice related impacts on atmospheric dynamics.},

abstract = {The application of stable isotopes in speleothem
records requires an understanding of the extent to
which speleothem calcite isotopic compositions
reflect the compositions of the cave waters from
which they precipitate. To test for equilibrium
precipitation, modern speleothem calcite was grown
on glass plates, so that the carbon and oxygen
isotope composition of the calcite and the water
from which it precipitated could be directly
compared. The plates were placed on the tops of
three actively growing stalagmites that occupy a 1
m(2) area in Harrison's Cave, Barbados, West
Indies. Only some of the plate delta(13)C values and
none of the plate delta(18)O values correspond to
equilibrium values, indicating significant kinetic
isotope effects during speleothem calcite growth. We
investigate herein mechanisms that may account for
the kinetic isotope effects. On each plate,
speleothem calcite was deposited with distinct
delta(18)O and delta(13)C compositions that increase
progressively away from the growth axis, with up to
6.6 parts per thousand C-13 and 1.7 parts per
thousand O-18 enrichments. The positive delta(13)C
versus delta(18)O trends are likely a result of O-18
and C-13 Rayleigh-distillation enrichment in the
HCO3- reservoir owing to progressive CO2 degassing
and CaCO3 precipitation. The magnitude of the
delta(13)C versus 8180 slope is likely controlled by
the extent to which CO2 hydration-hydroxylation
reactions buffer the oxygen isotope composition of
the HCO3- reservoir during calcite
precipitation. Complete oxygen isotopic buffering of
the HCO3- reservoir by CO2 hydration-hydroxylation
reactions will produce a vertical delta(13)C versus
delta(18)O slope in calcite sampled along a growth
layer. As oxygen isotope buffering of the HCO3-
reservoir decreases to no buffering, the delta(13)C
versus delta(13)O slope in calcite sampled along a
growth layer will decrease from vertical to 0.52 at
the cave temperature. In this study, modern
speleothem calcite sampled along the growth layer
produced a delta(13)C versus delta(18)O slope of
3.9, indicating incomplete oxygen isotope buffering
of the HCO3- reservoir during calcite precipitation.
Both modern and Holocene speleothem calcite from
Barbados, sampled temporally along the growth axis,
shows similar positive delta(13)C versus delta(18)O
slopes. These results, along with the spatial
variations in glass plate calcite carbon and oxygen
isotope compositions, suggest that the isotopic
composition of the Holocene speleothems is in part
controlled by non-equilibrium isotope effects. In
addition, there is a correlation between stalactite
length and oxygen and carbon isotope ratios of
calcite precipitated on the corresponding stalagmite
and glass plate, which may be due to C-13 and O-18
enrichment of the HCO3- reservoir during CO,
degassing-calcite precipitation along the
overhanging stalactite. We compiled 165 published
speleothem stable isotope records with a global
distribution and found that most of these records
show a positive covariation between delta(13)C and
delta(18)O values. Speleothem stable isotope records
may be influenced by kinetic isotope effects such
that temperature-controlled equilibrium
fractionation models alone cannot directly explain
the significance of the variations in these
records. Advancing the interpretation of these
records requires the calibration of cave
environmental conditions with the nonequilibrium
isotope effects that cause delta(13)C and delta(18)O
covariations in speleothems.},

abstract = {Twenty ice cores drilled in medium to high accumulation areas of the Greenland ice sheet have been used to extract seasonally resolved stable isotope records. Relationships between the seasonal stable isotope data and Greenland and Icelandic temperatures as well as atmospheric flow are investigated for the past 150--200 years. The winter season stable isotope data are found to be influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and very closely related to {\{}SW{\}} Greenland temperatures. The linear correlation between the first principal component of the winter season stable isotope data and Greenland winter temperatures is 0.71 for seasonally resolved data and 0.83 for decadally filtered data. The summer season stable isotope data display higher correlations with Stykkisholmur summer temperatures and North Atlantic {\{}SST{\}} conditions than with {\{}SW{\}} Greenland temperatures. The linear correlation between Stykkisholmur summer temperatures and the first principal component of the summer season stable isotope data is 0.56, increasing to 0.66 for decadally filtered data. Winter season stable isotope data from ice core records that reach more than 1400 years back in time suggest that the warm period that began in the 1920s raised southern Greenland temperatures to the same level as those that prevailed during the warmest intervals of the Medieval Warm Period some 900--1300 years ago. This observation is supported by a southern Greenland ice core borehole temperature inversion. As Greenland borehole temperature inversions are found to correspond better with winter stable isotope data than with summer or annual average stable isotope data it is suggested that a strong local Greenland temperature signal can be extracted from the winter stable isotope data even on centennial to millennial time scales. },

In the other perspective, we investigate how the hiatus relates to changes in energy fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and to the three-dimensional distribution of ocean heat content change on decadal timescales. We find that the recent surface warming hiatus is associated with a transition of the IPO from a positive to negative phase and with heat redistribution between the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. The AMO has shifted to a positive phase since the late 1990s, inducing a La Ni{\~{n}}a-type response over the tropical Pacific via a tropic-wide teleconnection, contributing to the global warming hiatus.},

Two sets of simulations have been conducted, one with representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 radiative forcing and the second with RCP forcing but with Arctic sea ice nudged to its 1990 state. The difference between the two five-member sets indicates the influence of decreasing Arctic sea ice on the climate system. Within the Arctic, sea ice loss is found to be a primary driver of the surface temperature and precipitation changes. Arctic sea ice depletion also plays a dominant role in projected Atlantic meridional overturning circulation weakening and changes in North Atlantic extratropical sea surface temperature and salinity, especially in the first half century. The effect of present-day Arctic sea ice loss on Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropical atmospheric circulation is small relative to internal variability and the future sea ice loss effect on atmospheric circulation is distinct from the projected anthropogenic change. Arctic sea ice loss warms NH extratropical continents and is an important contributor to global warming not only over high latitudes but also in the eastern United States. Last, the Arctic sea ice loss displaces the Pacific intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) equatorward and induces a "mini-global warming" in the tropical upper troposphere.},

term trends are evaluated. The results show that
trends in ET in spring and summer are determined
primarily by trends in precipitation and snowmelt
that determine water availability. From April to
June, ET trends are mostly positive due primarily to
earlier snowmelt and earlier emergence of snow-free
ground, and secondarily to increasing trends in
spring precipitation. From July to September trends
in ET are more strongly influenced by precipitation
trends, with the exception of areas (most notably
California) that receive little summer precipitation
and have experienced large changes in snowmelt
timing. Trends in the seasonal timing of ET are
modest, but during the period 1947 - 2003 when
temperature trends are large, they reflect a shift
of ET from midsummer to early summer and late
spring. As in other studies, it is found that runoff
is occurring earlier in spring, a trend that is
related primarily to increasing temperature, and is
most apparent during 1947 - 2003. Trends in the
annual runoff ratio, a variable critical to western
water management, are determined primarily by trends
in cool season precipitation, rather than changes in
the timing of runoff or ET. It was found that the
signature of temperature- related trends in runoff
and SM is strongly keyed to mean midwinter [December
- February (DJF)] temperatures. Areas with warmer
winter temperatures show increasing trends in the
runoff fraction as early as February, and colder
areas as late as June. Trends toward earlier spring
SM recharge are apparent and increasing trends in SM
on 1 April are evident over much of the region. The
1 July SM trends are less affected by snowmelt
changes and are controlled more by precipitation
trends.},

abstract = {The outlook for Sahel precipitation in coupled
simulations of the twenty-first century is very
uncertain, with different models disagreeing even on
the sign of the trends. Such disagreement is
especially surprising in light of the robust
response of the same coupled models to the
twentieth-century forcings. This study presents a
statistical analysis of the preindustrial,
twentieth-century and twenty-first-century A1B
scenario simulations in the latest Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) dataset; it shows
that the relationship that links Sahel rainfall
anomalies to tropical sea surface temperature (SST)
anomalies at interannual time scales in observations
is reproduced by most models, independently of the
change in the basic state as the world warms. The
same SST-Sahel relationship can be used to predict
the simulated twentieth-century changes in Sahel
rainfall from each model's simulation of changes in
Indo-Pacific SST and Atlantic SST meridional
gradient, although the prediction overestimates the
simulated trends. Conversely, such a relationship
does not explain the rainfall trend in the
twenty-first century in a majority of models. These
results are consistent with there being, in most
models, a substantial direct positive effect of
atmospheric greenhouse gases on Sahel rainfall, not
mediated through SST.},

abstract = {Could the Dust Bowl drought of the 1930s have been
predicted in advance if the SST anomalies of the
1930s had been foreknown? Ensembles of model
simulations forced with historical observed SSTs in
the global ocean, and also separately in the
tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, are compared
with an ensemble begun in January 1929 with modeled
atmosphere and land initial conditions and
integrated through the 1930s with climatological
SSTs. The ensemble with climatological SSTs produces
values for the precipitation averaged over 1932-39
that are not statistically different from model
climatology. In contrast, the ensembles with global
SST forcing produce a drought centered in the
central plains and southwestern North America that
is clearly separated from the model
climatology. Both the tropical Pacific and northern
tropical Atlantic SST anomalies produce a
statistically significant model drought in this
region. The modeled drought has a spatial pattern
that is different from the observed drought, which
was instead centered in the central and northern
plains and also impacted the northern Rocky Mountain
states but not northeastern Mexico. The model error
in extending the Dust Bowl drought too far south is
attributed to an incorrect response of the model to
warm subtropical North Atlantic SST anomalies. The
model error in the northern states cannot be
attributed to an incorrect response to tropical SST
anomalies. The model also fails to reproduce the
strong surface air warming across most of the
continent during the 1930s. In contrast, the modeled
patterns of precipitation reduction and surface air
temperature warming during the 1950s drought are
more realistic. Tree-ring records show that the Dust
Bowl pattern of drought has occurred before,
suggesting that while the extensive human-induced
land surface degradation and dust aerosol loading of
the 1930s drought may have played an important role
in generating the observed drought pattern, natural
processes, possibly including land interactions, are
capable of generating droughts centered to the north
of the main ENSO teleconnection region. Despite this
caveat, advance knowledge of tropical SSTs alone
would have allowed a high-confidence prediction of a
multiyear and severe drought, but one centered too
far south and without strong cross-continental
warming.},

abstract = {Climate variations on timescales longer than a year
are often characterized by temporal scaling
("power-law'') behavior for which spectral power
builds up at low frequencies, in contrast to
red-noise behavior for which spectral power
saturates at low frequencies. Checks on the ability
of climate prediction models to simulate temporal
scaling behavior represent stringent performance
tests on the models. We here estimate temporal
power-law exponents ("Hurst exponents'') for the
global atmospheric circulation of the stratosphere
and troposphere during the 20th century. We show
that current generation climate models generally
simulate the spatial distribution of the Hurst
exponents well. We then use simulations with
different climate forcings to explain the Hurst
exponent distribution and to account for
discrepancies in scaling behavior between different
observational products. We conclude that
characterization of temporal power-law behavior
provides a valuable tool for cross-validating
low-frequency variability in various datasets, for
elucidating the physical mechanisms underlying this
variability, and for statistical testing of trends
and periodicities in climate time series. Citation:

abstract = {In a changing climate, there is an ever-increasing societal demand for accurate and reliable interannual predictions. Accurate and reliable interannual predictions of global temperatures are key for determining the regional climate change impacts that scale with global temperature, such as precipitation extremes, severe droughts, or intense hurricane activity, for instance. However, the chaotic nature of the climate system limits prediction accuracy on such timescales. Here we develop a novel method to predict global-mean surface air temperature and sea surface temperature, based on transfer operators, which allows, by-design, probabilistic forecasts. The prediction accuracy is equivalent to operational forecasts and its reliability is high. The post-1998 global warming hiatus is well predicted. For 2018–2022, the probabilistic forecast indicates a warmer than normal period, with respect to the forced trend. This will temporarily reinforce the long-term global warming trend. The coming warm period is associated with an increased likelihood of intense to extreme temperatures. The important numerical efficiency of the method (a few hundredths of a second on a laptop) opens the possibility for real-time probabilistic predictions carried out on personal mobile devices. Accurate near-term predictions of global temperatures are required to determine some of the key impacts of climate change. Here the authors develop a novel probabilistic forecast system that shows anomalously warm temperatures for the next years with increased risk of extreme warming.},

abstract = {Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

abstract = {Abstract. The Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to a doubling of atmospheric CO2, along with the transient climate response (TCR) and greenhouse gas emissions pathways, determines the amount of future warming. Coupled climate models have in the past been important tools to estimate and understand ECS. ECS estimated from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models lies between 2.0 and 4.7 K (mean of 3.2 K), whereas in the latest CMIP6 the spread has increased to 1.8–5.5 K (mean of 3.7 K), with 5 out of 25 models exceeding 5 K. It is thus pertinent to understand the causes underlying this shift. Here we compare the CMIP5 and CMIP6 model ensembles and find a systematic shift between CMIP eras to be unexplained as a process of random sampling from modeled forcing and feedback distributions. Instead, shortwave feedbacks shift towards more positive values, in particular over the Southern Ocean, driving the shift towards larger ECS values in many of the models. These results suggest that changes in model treatment of mixed-phase cloud processes and changes to Antarctic sea ice representation are likely causes of the shift towards larger ECS. Somewhat surprisingly, CMIP6 models exhibit less historical warming than CMIP5 models, despite an increase in TCR between CMIP eras (mean TCR increased from 1.7 to 1.9 K). The evolution of the warming suggests, however, that several of the CMIP6 models apply too strong aerosol cooling, resulting in too weak mid-20th century warming compared to the instrumental record.},

abstract = {The importance of stratospheric ozone depletion on the atmospheric circulation of the troposphere is studied with an atmospheric general circulation model, the Community Atmospheric Model, version 3 (CAM3), for the second half of the twentieth century. In particular, the relative importance of ozone depletion is contrasted with that of increased greenhouse gases and accompanying sea surface temperature changes. By specifying ozone and greenhouse gas forcings independently, and performing long, time-slice integrations, it is shown that the impacts of ozone depletion are roughly 2-3 times larger than those associated with increased greenhouse gases, for the Southern Hemisphere tropospheric summer circulation. The formation of the ozone hole is shown to affect not only the polar tropopause and the latitudinal position of the midlatitude jet; it extends to the entire hemisphere, resulting in a broadening of the Hadley cell and a poleward extension of the subtropical dry zones. The CAM3 results are compared to and found to be in excellent agreement with those of the multimodel means of the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) and Chemistry-Climate Model Validation (CCMVal2) simulations. This study, therefore, strongly suggests that most Southern Hemisphere tropospheric circulation changes, in austral summer over the second half of the twentieth century, have been caused by polar stratospheric ozone depletion. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

were the colder substages 5d and 5b of OIS 5. By
contrast, during the two warmest periods of the past
164 ka, namely OIS 5e and 1, there was no deposition
on either side of the speleothem, suggesting
conditions as dry or drier than today. The record
from Carlsbad parallels data from many other sites
in the southwestern USA and northern Mexico, and
data from marine sediments and ice cores,
demonstrating the extent to which ice sheet
fluctuations influenced conditions in southern New
Mexico. Detailed correlation of delta C-13 values in
the Georgia Giant, which range from -6.6 to +0.9
parts per thousand relative to PDB, with distant
speleothem records and with data from ice cores,
further documents the linkage of southwestern
climate with global-scale extent of glaciation.
Values of delta O-18 in the Georgia Giant core range
from -9.7 to -4.7 parts per thousand relative to PDB
and average -6.6 parts per thousand. O-18-depleted
carbonate in the Georgia Giant during OIS 6, at a
time when the world's oceans were enriched in O-18,
suggests that precipitation during cold intervals
was brought largely by Pacific air masses in fall,
winter and spring as a result of the southward
displacement of the polar jet stream by the growth
of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Termination II,
marking the end of the penultimate glaciation, is
well defined in the core's delta O-18
data. Analytical uncertainties in the radiometric
ages do not preclude a start of Termination 11 as
late as 128 ka, as suggested by SPECMAP
data. However, data from the Georgia Giant core are
more compatible with an earlier start like that
obtained from Devils Hole and Vostok data, raising
the possibility that early warming was widespread in
the U.S. southwest region by 145 ka. (c) 2006

Although some phenological changes have been identified for native and perennial species and used to infer climate change in various regions of the world, little has been known for changes in agricultural plants/crops. In this study, heading or flowering dates of winter wheat cultivar Kharkof are examined from 70 years of data at six locations in the U.S. Great Plains. Results indicate a consistent trend of earlier heading or flowering dates across all sites, but rates of the trend differ (from 0.8 to 1.8 days per 10-year). Because the heading or flowering date is governed primarily by temperatures, the earlier heading or flowering dates indicate warming temperatures in the spring. Further examinations reveal increase in spring daily minimum temperatures. Findings of this study add a diverse species to the plant community for detecting the “fingerprint” of regional and global climate change.},

Here, we focus on parameterizations of ocean mesoscale eddies and employ machine learning (ML), namely, relevance vector machines (RVMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to derive computationally efficient parameterizations from data, which are interpretable and/or encapsulate physics. In particular, we demonstrate the usefulness of the RVM algorithm to reveal closed-form equations for eddy parameterizations with embedded conservation laws. When implemented in an idealized ocean model, all parameterizations improve the statistics of the coarse-resolution simulation. The CNN is more stable than the RVM such that its skill in reproducing the high-resolution simulation is higher than the other schemes; however, the RVM scheme is interpretable. This work shows the potential for new physics-aware interpretable ML turbulence parameterizations for use in ocean climate models.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The role of extratropical ocean warming in the coupled climate response to Arctic sea ice loss is investigated using coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) and uncoupled atmospheric-only (AGCM) experiments. Coupled AOGCM experiments driven by sea ice albedo reduction and greenhouse gas–dominated radiative forcing are used to diagnose the extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) response to sea ice loss. Sea ice loss is then imposed in AGCM experiments both with and without these extratropical SST changes, which are found to extend beyond the regions where sea ice is lost. Sea ice loss in isolation drives warming that is confined to the Arctic lower troposphere and only a weak atmospheric circulation response. When the extratropical SST response caused by sea ice loss is also included in the forcing, the warming extends into the Arctic midtroposphere during winter. This coincides with a stronger atmospheric circulation response, including an equatorward shift in the eddy-driven jet, a deepening of the Aleutian low, and an expansion of the Siberian high. Similar results are found whether the extratropical SST forcing is taken directly from the AOGCM driven by sea ice loss, or whether they are diagnosed using a two-parameter pattern scaling technique where tropical adjustment to sea ice loss is removed. These results suggest that AGCM experiments that are driven by sea ice loss and only local SST increases will underestimate the Arctic midtroposphere warming and atmospheric circulation response to sea ice loss, compared to AOGCM simulations and the real world.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As determined from an analysis of 17 submarine cruises, the overall mean thickness of Arctic sea ice above 65° N, including both deformed and undeformed ice, is 2.9 m with a standard deviation of 1.8 m. The overall seasonal mean ranges from approximately 2.4 m in spring to 3.3 m in summer. Local mean ice drafts ranged from less than 1 m near the marginal ice zone to greater than 7 m to the north of the Canadian Archipelago. Histograms of sea ice draft reflect a bimodal distribution in winter and spring, an effect of the presence of thin first year ice. Due to ice melt in summer and autumn only a single mode of much thicker multiyear ice is observed.},

It was scientifically exciting since, due to the short observational record, our knowledge of an extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o has been based only on the 1982/1983 and 1997/1998 events. The 2015/2016 El Ni{\~{n}}o was marked by many environmental disasters that are consistent with what is expected for an extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o. Considering the dramatic impacts of extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o, and the risk of a potential increase in frequency of ENSO extremes under greenhouse warming, it is timely to evaluate how the recent event fits into our understanding of ENSO extremes. Here we provide a review of ENSO, its nature and dynamics, and through analysis of various observed key variables, we outline the processes that characterize its extremes. The 2015/2016 El Ni{\~{n}}o brings a useful perspective into the state of understanding of these events and highlights areas for future research. While the 2015/2016 El Ni{\~{n}}o is characteristically distinct from the 1982/1983 and 1997/1998 events, it still can be considered as the first extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o of the 21st century. Its extremity can be attributed in part to unusually warm condition in 2014 and to long-term background warming. In effect, this study provides a list of physically meaningful indices that are straightforward to compute for identifying and tracking extreme ENSO events in observations and climate models.},

abstract = {Model simulations of the next few decades are widely used in assessments of climate change impacts and as guidance for adaptation. Their non-linear nature reveals a level of irreducible uncertainty which it is important to understand and quantify, especially for projections of near-term regional climate. Here we use large idealised initial condition ensembles of the FAMOUS global climate model with a 1 {\%}/year compound increase in CO 2 levels to quantify the range of future temperatures in model-based projections. These simulations explore the role of both atmospheric and oceanic initial conditions and are the largest such ensembles to date. Short-term simulated trends in global temperature are diverse, and cooling periods are more likely to be followed by larger warming rates. The spatial pattern of near-term temperature change varies considerably, but the proportion of the surface showing a warming is more consistent. In addition, ensemble spread in inter-annual temperature declines as the climate warms, especially in the North Atlantic. Over Europe, atmospheric initial condition uncertainty can, for certain ocean initial conditions, lead to 20 year trends in winter and summer in which every location can exhibit either strong cooling or rapid warming. However, the details of the distribution are highly sensitive to the ocean initial condition chosen and particularly the state of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. On longer timescales, the warming signal becomes more clear and consistent amongst different initial condition ensembles. An ensemble using a range of different oceanic initial conditions produces a larger spread in temperature trends than ensembles using a single ocean initial condition for all lead times. This highlights the potential benefits from initialising climate predictions from ocean states informed by observations. These results suggest that climate projections need to be performed with many more ensemble members than at present, using a range of ocean initial conditions, if the uncertainty in near-term regional climate is to be adequately quantified.},

with a research literature that dates back almost

and climatological aspects of the North American
monsoon, highlighting historical development and
major research themes. The domain of the North
American monsoon is large, extending over much of
the western United States from its region of
greatest influence in northwestern Mexico. Regarding
the debate over moisture source regions and water
vapor advection into southwestern North America,
there is general agreement that the bulk of monsoon
moisture is advected at low levels from the eastern
tropical Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California,
while the Gulf of Mexico may contribute some
upper-level moisture (although mixing occurs over
the Sierra Madre Occidental). Surges of low-level
moisture from the Gulf of California are a
significant part of intraseasonal monsoon
variability, and they are associated with the
configuration of upper-level midlatitude troughs and
tropical easterly waves at the synoptic scale, as
well as the presence of low-level jets, a thermal
low, and associated dynamics (including the
important effects of local topography) at the
mesoscale. Seasonally, the gulf surges and the
latitudinal position of the midtropospheric
subtropical ridge over southwestern North America
appear to be responsible for much spatial and
temporal variability in precipitation. Interannual
variability of the North American monsoon system is
high, but it is not strongly linked to El Nino or
other common sources of interannual circulation
variability. Recent mesoscale field measurements
gathered during the South-West Area Monsoon Project

abstract = {This paper addresses and documents a number of
issues related to the implementation of an advanced

fifth-generation Mesoscale Model (MM5). The concept
adopted here is that the land surface model should
be able to provide not only reasonable diurnal
variations of surface heat fluxes as surface
boundary conditions for coupled models, but also
correct seasonal evolutions of soil moisture in the
context of a long-term data assimilation system. In
a similar way to that in which the modified Oregon
State University land surface model (LSM) has been
used in the NCEP global and regional forecast
models, it is implemented in MM5 to facilitate the
initialization of soil moisture. Also, 1-km
resolution vegetation and soil texture maps are
introduced in the coupled MM5-LSM system to help
identify vegetation/water/ soil characteristics at
fine scales and capture the feedback of these land
surface forcings. A monthly varying climatological
0.15 degrees x 0.15 degrees green vegetation
fraction is utilized to represent the annual control
of vegetation on the surface
evaporation. Specification of various vegetation and
soil parameters is discussed, and the available
water capacity in the LSM is extended to account for
subgrid-scale heterogeneity. The coupling of the LSM
to MM5 is also sensitive to the treatment of the
surface layer, especially the calculation of the
roughness length for heat/moisture. Including the
effect of the molecular sublayer can improve the
simulation of surface heat flux. It is shown that
the soil thermal and hydraulic conductivities and
the surface energy balance are very sensitive to
soil moisture changes. Hence, it is necessary to
establish an appropriate soil moisture data
assimilation system to improve the soil moisture
initialization at fine scales.},

However, large ensembles are invariably computationally expensive and susceptible to model bias.Here the authors outline an alternative approach for assessing the role of internal variability in future climate based on a simple analytic model and the statistics of the unforced climate variability. The analytic model is derived from the standard error of the regression and assumes that the statistics of the internal variability are roughly Gaussian and stationary in time.

abstract = {The Arctic has been warming faster than elsewhere, especially during the cold season. According to the leading theory, ice-albedo feedback warms the Arctic Ocean during the summer, and the heat gained by the ocean is released during the winter, causing the cold-season warming. Screen and Simmonds (2010; SS10) concluded that the theory is correct by comparing trend patterns in surface air temperature (SAT), surface turbulence heat flux (HF), and net surface infrared radiation (IR). However, in this comparison, downward IR is more appropriate to use. By analyzing the same data used in SS10 using the surface energy budget, it is shown here that over most of the Arctic the skin temperature trend, which closely resembles the SAT trend, is largely accounted for by the downward IR, not the HF, trend.},

An overall warming trend of 1.3°C in the ocean surface, a deepening in the depth of the mean thermocline (18 m), and increased stratification between 1950 and 1999 are found to be primarily forced by large-scale decadal fluctuations in surface heat fluxes combined with horizontal advection by the mean currents. After 1998 the surface heat fluxes suggest the beginning of a period of cooling, consistent with colder observed ocean temperatures. Salinity changes are decoupled from temperature and appear to be controlled locally in the coastal ocean by horizontal advection by anomalous currents. A cooling trend of –0.5°C in SST is...},

abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of
scientific interest and have significant
consequences for our understanding of natural and
man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and
characterization of power laws is complicated by the
large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the
distribution-the part of the distribution
representing large but rare events-and by the
difficulty of identifying the range over which
power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for
analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares
fitting, can produce Substantially inaccurate
estimates of parameters for power-law distributions,
and even in cases where such methods return accurate
answers they are still unsatisfactory because they
give no indication of whether the data obey a power
law at all. Here we present a principled statistical
framework for discerning and quantifying power-law
behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines
maximum-likelihood fitting methods with
goodness-of-fit tests based on the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood
ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
approach with tests on synthetic data, and give
critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also
apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world
data sets from a range of different disciplines,
each of which has been conjectured to follow a
power-law distribution. In some cases we find these
conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in
others the power law is ruled out.},

@article{newman07_predictability,
abstract = {A multivariate empirical model is used to show that
predictability of the dominant patterns of tropical
and North Pacific oceanic variability, El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific
decadal oscillation (PDO), is mostly limited to
little more than a year, despite the presence of
spectral peaks on decadal time scales. The model
used is a linear inverse model (LIM) derived from
the observed simultaneous and 1-yr lag correlation
statistics of July-June-averaged SST from the Hadley
Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature
(HadISST) dataset for the years 1900-2002. The model
accurately reproduces the power spectra of the data,
including interannual and interdecadal spectral
peaks that are significant relative to univariate
red noise. Eigenanalysis of the linear dynamical
operator yields propagating eigenmodes that
correspond to these peaks but have very short decay
times and, thus, limited predictability.
Longer-term predictability does exist, however, due
to two stationary eigenmodes that are more weakly
damped. These eigenmodes do not strongly correspond
to the canonical ENSO and PDO patterns. Instead, one
is similar to the 1900-2002 trend and might
represent anthropogenic effects, while the second
represents multidecadal fluctuations of a pattern
that potentially represents natural decadal
variability; however, neither attribution can be
made unambiguously with the analysis presented in
this paper. Predictability of these two stationary
eigenmodes is significantly enhanced by
tropical-North Pacific coupling. Neither stationary
eigenmode is well captured in the control run of any
coupled GCM in the CMIP-3 project of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), perhaps because in
all of the GCMs tropical SST decadal variability is
too weak and North Pacific SSTs are too independent
of the Tropics. A key implication of this analysis
is that the PDO may represent not a single physical
mode but rather the sum of several phenomena, each
of which represents a different red noise with its
own autocorrelation time scale and spatial
pattern. The sum of these red noises can give rise
to apparent PDO "regime shifts" and seeming
characteristics of a long memory process. Such
shifts are not predictable beyond the time scale of
the most rapidly decorrelating noise, less than two
years, although the expected duration of regimes may
be determined from the relative amplitudes of
different eigenmodes.},

abstract = {The states of Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming comprise the Northern Great Plains region of the USA. The soil and water resources contained in this region have historically supported highly diverse and productive agriculture enterprises that provide a significant proportion of the food, feed, and oilseed for the nation. The region also provides ecological services that influence air, water, and soil quality along with biological diversity. Combined with livestock production and a biofuel industry, crop production forms an integrated system that can offer producers flexibility in management decisions. Projected climatic changes for this region include increasing atmospheric CO2, a longer, warmer growing season, and increased precipitation, likely received in more frequent extreme events. These changes will impact soil and water resources in the region and create opportunities and challenges for land managers. The objectives of this paper are to describe anticipated impacts of projected mid-(2050) and late-(2085) climatic changes on crop production systems in the Northern Great Plains and provide adaptation strategies that should be developed to take advantage of positive and mitigate negative changes. Projected climatic changes will influence agricultural productivity directly as well as indirectly due to changes in weed pressure, insect populations, and diseases. A warmer, longer growing season will change the crops and distribution of those crops grown within the region. An increase in the number of extreme temperature events (high daytime highs or nighttime lows) will decrease crop yields due to increased plant stress during critical pollination and grain fill periods. Adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability of soil and water resources to projected climatic changes include increasing cropping intensity, reducing tillage intensity, and use of cover crops to provide surface cover to reduce erosion potential and improve nutrient and water use efficiency. Increased use of perennial forages, crop residue, and failed crops in integrated crop-livestock systems will add biological diversity and provide options for converting vegetation biomass into animal protein. Socio-economic changes will need to be incorporated into adaptation strategies planning to insure that sustaining ecosystem services and meeting desired production and conservation goals is accomplished. Education and extension services will be needed to transfer adaptive knowledge in a timely manner to producers in the field.},

@article{schubert04_long_term_drought,
abstract = {The U.S. Great Plains experienced a number of
multiyear droughts during the last century, most
notably the droughts of the 1930s and 1950s. This
study examines the causes of such droughts using
ensembles of long-term (1930-2000) simulations
carried out with the NASA Seasonal-to-Interannual
Prediction Project (NSIPP-1) atmospheric general
circulation model (AGCM) forced with observed sea
surface temperatures (SSTs). The results show that
the model produces long-term (multiyear) variations
in precipitation in the Great Plains region
(30degrees-50degreesN, 95degrees-105degreesW) that
are similar to those observed. A correlative
analysis suggests that the ensemble-mean
low-frequency (time scales longer than about 6 yr)
rainfall variations in the Great Plains are linked
to a pan-Pacific pattern of SST variability that is
the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) in
the low-frequency SST data. The link between the SST
and the Great Plains precipitation is confirmed in
idealized AGCM simulations, in which the model is
forced by the two polarities of the pan-Pacific SST
pattern. The idealized simulations further show that
it is primarily the tropical part of the SST
anomalies that influences the Great Plains. As such,
the Great Plains tend to have above-normal
precipitation when the tropical Pacific SSTs are
above normal, while there is a tendency for drought
when the tropical SSTs are cold. The
upper-tropospheric response to the pan-Pacific SST
EOF shows a global-scale pattern with a strong wave
response in the Pacific and a substantial zonally
symmetric component in which U. S. Great Plains
pluvial (drought) conditions are associated with
reduced (enhanced) heights throughout the
extratropics. The potential predictability of
rainfall in the Great Plains associated with SSTs is
rather modest, with about one-third of the total
low-frequency rainfall variance being forced by SST
anomalies. Further idealized experiments with
climatological SST suggest that the remaining
low-frequency variance in the Great Plains
precipitation is the result of interactions with
soil moisture. In particular, simulations with soil
moisture feedback show a fivefold increase in the
variance in annual Great Plains precipitation
compared with simulations in which the soil feedback
is excluded. In addition to increasing variance, the
interactions with the soil introduce a year-to-year
memory in the hydrological cycle. The impact of soil
memory is consistent with a red noise process, in
which the deep soil is forced by white noise and
damped with a time scale of about 1.5 yr. As such,
the role of low-frequency SST variability is to
introduce a bias to the net forcing on the soil
moisture that drives the random process
preferentially to either wet or dry conditions.},

abstract = {Widespread public and scientific interest in the recent global warming hiatus and related multidecadal climate variability stimulated a surge in our understanding of key metrics of global climate change. While seeking explanations for the nearly steady global mean temperature from late 1990s through the early 2010s, the scientific community also grappled with concomitant and seemingly inconsistent changes in other metrics. For example, over that period, Arctic sea ice experienced a rapid decline but Antarctic sea ice expanded slightly, summertime warm extremes continued to rise without evidence of a pause, and the expanding Hadley cell trend maintained its course. In this article, we review recent advances in understanding the multidecadal variability of these metrics of global climate change, focusing on how internal multidecadal variability may reconcile differences between projected and recently observed trends and apparent inconsistencies between recent trends in some metrics. We emphasize that the impacts of global scale, naturally occurring patterns on multidecadal timescales, most notably the Pacific and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, tend to be more regionally heterogeneous than those of radiatively forced change, which weakens the relationship between local climate impacts and global mean temperature on multidecadal timescales. We conclude this review with a summary of current challenges and opportunities for progress.},

Mechanisms of sudden ice loss are strongly related to atmospheric circulation conditions and preconditioning by sea ice thinning during the seasons and years before the event. Clustering of events in time suggests a strong control by large-scale atmospheric circulation. Anomalous atmospheric circulation is providing warm air anomalies of up to 5 K and is forcing ice flow, affecting winter ice growth. Even without a seasonal preconditioning during winter, ice drop events can be initiated by anomalous inflow of warm air during summer. It is shown that RILEs can be generated based on atmospheric circulation changes as a major driving force without major competing mechanisms, other than occasional longwave effects during spring and summer. Other anomalous seasonal radiative forcing or short-lived forcers (e.g., soot) play minor roles or no role at all in our model. RILEs initiated by ocean forcing do not occur in the model, although cannot be ruled out due to model limitations. Mechanisms found are qualitatively in line with observations of the 2007 RILE.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The skill of several predictors of the pan-Arctic sea ice area was quantified: the sea ice area itself, the pan-Arctic sea ice volume, and some areal predictors built from the subgrid ice thickness distribution (ITD). Sea ice area provides a potential predictability of about 3 months, which is consistent with previous studies using model and observation data. Sea ice volume predictive skill for winter sea ice area prediction is weak. Nevertheless, there is a higher potential to predict the September ice area with the June volume anomaly than with the June area anomaly. Using ITD-based predictors, two “regimes” of predictability were highlighted. The first one, a “persistence regime,” applies to winter/early spring sea ice seasonal predictability.

Aiming at the imperious demand of short-term prediction for sea ice, we develop a new data-driven prediction technique for the sea ice concentration (SIC) combined with causal analysis. Through the causal analysis based on kernel Granger causality (KGC) test, key environmental factors affecting SIC are selected. Then multiple popular machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely self-adaptive differential extreme learning machine (SaD-ELM), classification and regression tree (CART), random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR), are employed to predict daily SIC, respectively. The experimental results in the Barents-Kara (B-K) sea show: (1) compared with correlation analysis, the input variables of ML models screened out by causal analysis achieve better prediction; (2) when lead time is short ({\textless}3 d), the four ML algorithms are all suitable for short-term prediction of daily SIC, while RF and SaD-ELM have better prediction performance with long lead time ({\textgreater}3 d); (3) RF has the best prediction accuracy and generalization ability but hugely time consuming, while SaD-ELM achieves more favorable performance when taking computational complexity into consideration. In summary, ML is applicable to short-term prediction of daily SIC, which develops a new way of sea ice prediction and provides technical support for Arctic navigation.},

@article{Sellevold2016,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}There is an ongoing debate over whether accelerated Arctic warming [Arctic amplification (AA)] is altering the large-scale circulation responsible for the anomalous weather experienced by midlatitude regions in recent years. Among the proposed mechanisms is the idea that local processes associated with sea ice loss heat the lower troposphere at high latitudes, thus weakening the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and driving changes in quasi-stationary waves, the midlatitude jets, and storm tracks. It is further hypothesized that these circulation changes are conducive to persistent weather patterns. Because of the short observational record and large atmospheric internal variability, it is difficult to identify robust relationships and infer causality. Here, a simplified, linear, steady-state model is used to investigate the direct response of the midlatitude atmospheric circulation to thermal forcing in the Arctic. The results suggest that there is a weak midlatitude circulation response to an idealized, but representative, Arctic heating perturbation. Further, the stationary wave responses are shown to be well within the bounds of internal variability. A midlatitude response is excited if the idealized heating penetrates up to the tropopause. Such deep, persistent heating is not observed on average during the AA period but does suggest a pathway for Arctic–midlatitude linkages under specific conditions. This study adds to the growing body of work suggesting that warming in the lower troposphere associated with Arctic amplification is not currently a direct driver of anomalous midlatitude circulation changes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {When simulating past warm climates, such as the early Cretaceous and Paleogene periods, general circulation models (GCMs) underestimate the magnitude of warming in the Arctic. Additionally, model intercomparisons show a large spread in the magnitude of Arctic warming for these warmer-than-modern climates. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these disagreements, including the unrealistic representation of polar clouds or underestimated poleward heat transport in the models. This study provides an intercomparison of Arctic cloud and atmospheric heat transport (AHT) responses to strong imposed polar-amplified surface ocean warming across four atmosphere-only GCMs. All models simulate an increase in high clouds throughout the year; the resulting reduction in longwave radiation loss to space acts to support the imposed Arctic warming. The response of low- and midlevel clouds varies considerably across the models, with models responding differently to surface warming and sea ice removal. The AHT is consistently weaker in the imposed warming experiments due to a large reduction in dry static energy transport that offsets a smaller increase in latent heat transport, thereby opposing the imposed surface warming. Our idealized polar amplification experiments require very large increases in implied ocean heat transport (OHT) to maintain steady state. Increased CO2 or tropical temperatures that likely characterized past warm climates reduce the need for such large OHT increases.},

abstract = {Satellite observations reveal a substantial decline in September Arctic sea ice extent since 1979, which has played a leading role in the observed recent Arctic surface warming and has often been attributed, in large part, to the increase in greenhouse gases. However, the most rapid decline occurred during the recent global warming hiatus period. Previous studies are often focused on a single mechanism for changes and variations of summer Arctic sea ice extent, and many are based on short observational records. The key players for summer Arctic sea ice extent variability at multidecadal/centennial time scales and their contributions to the observed summer Arctic sea ice decline are not well understood. Here a multiple regression model is developed for the first time, to the author's knowledge, to provide a framework to quantify the contributions of three key predictors (Atlantic/Pacific heat transport into the Arctic, and Arctic Dipole) to the internal low-frequency variability of Summer Arctic sea ice extent, using a 3,600-y-long control climate model simulation. The results suggest that changes in these key predictors could have contributed substantially to the observed summer Arctic sea ice decline. If the ocean heat transport into the Arctic were to weaken in the near future due to internal variability, there might be a hiatus in the decline of September Arctic sea ice. The modeling results also suggest that at multidecadal/centennial time scales, variations in the atmosphere heat transport across the Arctic Circle are forced by anticorrelated variations in the Atlantic heat transport into the Arctic.},

Five ensemble members are run for each of five aerosol scaling factors. Decadal variations in surface temperatures are strongly sensitive to aerosol forcing, particularly between 1950 and 1980. Post-1980, trends are dominated by greenhouse gas forcing, with much lower sensitivity to aerosol emission differences. Most realizations with aerosol forcing more negative than about –1 Wm–2 simulate stronger cooling trends in the mid-20th century compared with observations, while the simulated warming post-1980 always exceeds observed warming, likelydue to a warm bias in the transient climate response in HadGEM3-GC3.1.},

of the forest to the combined pressures of
deforestation and global warming is therefore of
great concern(2), especially as some general

we analyse these climate projections with reference
to the 2005 drought in western Amazonia, which was

Amazonia correlates well with an index of the north

is unusual among current GCMs in that it is able to

abstract = {The comparison of observed global mean surface air temperature (GMT) change to the mean change simulated by climate models has received much public and scientific attention. For a given global warming signal produced by a climate model ensemble, there exists an envelope of GMT values representing the range of possible unforced states of the climate system (the Envelope of Unforced Noise; EUN). Typically, the EUN is derived from climate models themselves, but climate models might not accurately simulate the correct characteristics of unforced GMT variability. Here, we simulate a new, empirical, EUN that is based on instrumental and reconstructed surface temperature records. We compare the forced GMT signal produced by climate models to observations while noting the range of GMT values provided by the empirical EUN. We find that the empirical EUN is wide enough so that the interdecadal variability in the rate of global warming over the 20th century does not necessarily require corresponding variability in the rate-of-increase of the forced signal. The empirical EUN also indicates that the reduced GMT warming over the past decade or so is still consistent with a middle emission scenario's forced signal, but is likely inconsistent with the steepest emission scenario's forced signal.},

abstract = {The 2004 North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME)
provided an unprecedented observing network for
studying the structure and evolution of the North
American monsoon. This paper focuses on multiscale
characteristics of the flow during NAME from the
large scale to the mesoscale using atmospheric
sounding data from the enhanced observing network.
The onset of the 2004 summer monsoon over the NAME
region accompanied the typical northward shift of
the upper-level anticyclone or monsoon high over
northern Mexico into the southwestern United States,
but in 2004 this shift occurred slightly later than
normal and the monsoon high did not extend as far
north as usual. Consequently, precipitation over the
southwestern United States was slightly below
normal, although increased troughiness over the
Great Plains contributed to increased rainfall over
eastern New Mexico and western Texas. The first
major pulse of moisture into the Southwest occurred
around 13 July in association with a strong Gulf of
California surge. This surge was linked to the
westward passages of Tropical Storm Blas to the
south and an upper-level inverted trough over
northern Texas. The development of Blas appeared to
be favored as an easterly wave moved into the
eastern Pacific during the active phase of a
Madden-Julian oscillation. On the regional scale,
sounding data reveal a prominent sea breeze along
the east shore of the Gulf of California, with a
deep return flow as a consequence of the elevated
Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) immediately to the
east. Subsidence produced a dry layer over the gulf,
whereas a deep moist layer existed over the west
slopes of the SMO. A prominent nocturnal low-level
jet was present on most days over the northern
gulf. The diurnal cycle of heating and moistening
(Q1 and Q2) over the SMO was characterized by deep
convective profiles in the mid- to upper troposphere
at 1800 LT, followed by stratiform-like profiles at
midnight, consistent with the observed diurnal
evolution of precipitation over this coastal
mountainous region. The analyses in the core NAME
domain are based on a gridded dataset derived from
atmospheric soundings only and, therefore, should
prove useful in validating reanalyses and regional
models.},

A pronounced low sea level pressure anomaly over the Eastern Arctic (-200 Pa) reinforces a sea level pressure dipole over the Arctic that has been observed to become an increasingly important feature of the Arctic atmospheric circulation in summer. The anomalous pressure distribution contributes to sea ice transport from the Eastern Arctic and is likely to reinforce the original sea ice extent anomaly. The results thus support assessments of observational data over recent years that sea ice loss may feed back onto the atmospheric circulation in the northern hemisphere. The resulting late summer/early fall (JAS) atmospheric anomalies are very robust, they appear in virtually all of the 40 realizations of the experiment. However, we find no significant continuation of the atmospheric signal into the winter as has been suggested based on atmospheric observational data.

abstract = {Polar amplification – the phenomenon where external radiative forcing produces a larger change in surface temperature at high latitudes than the global average – is a key aspect of anthropogenic climate change, but its causes and consequences are not fully understood. The Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP) contribution to the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6; Eyring et al., 2016) seeks to improve our understanding of this phenomenon through a coordinated set of numerical model experiments documented here. In particular, PAMIP will address the following primary questions: (1) what are the relative roles of local sea ice and remote sea surface temperature changes in driving polar amplification? (2) How does the global climate system respond to changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice? These issues will be addressed with multi-model simulations that are forced with different combinations of sea ice and/or sea surface temperatures representing present-day, pre-industrial and future conditions. The use of three time periods allows the signals of interest to be diagnosed in multiple ways. Lower-priority tier experiments are proposed to investigate additional aspects and provide further understanding of the physical processes. These experiments will address the following specific questions: what role does ocean–atmosphere coupling play in the response to sea ice? How and why does the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice depend on the pattern of sea ice forcing? How and why does the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice depend on the model background state? What have been the roles of local sea ice and remote sea surface temperature in polar amplification, and the response to sea ice, over the recent period since 1979? How does the response to sea ice evolve on decadal and longer timescales? A key goal of PAMIP is to determine the real-world situation using imperfect climate models. Although the experiments proposed here form a coordinated set, we anticipate a large spread across models. However, this spread will be exploited by seeking “emergent constraints” in which model uncertainty may be reduced by using an observable quantity that physically explains the intermodel spread. In summary, PAMIP will improve our understanding of the physical processes that drive polar amplification and its global climate impacts, thereby reducing the uncertainties in future projections and predictions of climate change and variability. ]]{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Anthropogenic changes to land cover (LCC) remain common, but continuing land scarcity promotes the widespread intensification of land management changes (LMC) to better satisfy societal demand for food, fibre, fuel and shelter. The biophysical effects of LCC on surface climate are largely understood, particularly for the boreal and tropical zones, but fewer studies have investigated the biophysical consequences of LMC; that is, anthropogenic modification without a change in land cover type. Harmonized analysis of ground measurements and remote sensing observations of both LCC and LMC revealed that, in the temperate zone, potential surface cooling from increased albedo is typically offset by warming from decreased sensible heat fluxes, with the net effect being a warming of the surface. Temperature changes from LMC and LCC were of the same magnitude, and averaged 2 K at the vegetation surface and were estimated at 1.7 K in the planetary boundary layer. Given the spatial extent of land management (42-58{\%} of the land surface) this calls for increasing the efforts to integrate land management in Earth System Science to better take into account the human impact on the climate. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Reduced-order dynamical models play a central role in developing our understanding of predictability of climate irrespective of whether we are dealing with the actual climate system or surrogate climate models. In this context, the linear inverse modeling (LIM) approach, by capturing a few essential interactions between dynamical components of the full system, has proven valuable in providing insights into predictability of the full system. We demonstrate that reservoir computing (RC), a form of learning suitable for systems with chaotic dynamics, provides an alternative nonlinear approach that improves on the predictive skill of the LIM approach. We do this in the example setting of predicting sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic in the preindustrial control simulation of a popular earth system model, the Community Earth System Model so that we can compare the performance of the new RC-based approach with the traditional LIM approach both when learning data are plentiful and when such data are more limited. The improved predictive skill of the RC approach over a wide range of conditions—larger number of retained EOF coefficients, extending well into the limited data regime, etc.—suggests that this machine-learning technique may have a use in climate predictability studies. While the possibility of developing a climate emulator—the ability to continue the evolution of the system on the attractor long after failing to be able to track the reference trajectory—is demonstrated in the Lorenz-63 system, it is suggested that further development of the RC approach may permit such uses of the new approach in more realistic predictability studies.},

The strongest influence of SST variations has been found for the warm ENSO events considered.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The role of synoptic-scale cyclones in the trends and variability of Arctic sea ice conditions has remained uncertain. In recognition, we conduct a systematic investigation of how sea-ice concentration (SIC) changes with cyclone passage, including all individual storms that pass over any part of the region's ice pack. For all seasons, especially summer and autumn, we find a pattern of higher ice concentration after a region is influenced by a cyclone compared to when it is not, primarily due to thermodynamic effects. During warm months, cyclones appear to slow the general day-to-day decline in concentration; in cold months, cyclones augment the day-to-day increase. These relationships are changing over time, with cyclone-associated concentration changes becoming less distinct from overall changes. Cyclone effects on ice divergence are spatially variable; computed fields are noisy. In summer, these dynamic effects of cyclone passage generally decrease SIC, but are outweighed by the thermodynamic effects (e.g., reductions in air temperature, shortwave radiation). In autumn, cyclone-associated concentration changes are not as easily explained by observed cyclone conditions. Key questions remain regarding the extent to which our findings are influenced by artifacts of surface melt and weather effects on the passive microwave retrievals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The potential loss or large-scale degradation of the
tropical rainforests has become one of the iconic
images of the impacts of twenty-first century
environmental change and may be one of our century's
most profound legacies. In the Amazon region, the
direct threat of deforestation and degradation is
now strongly intertwined with an indirect challenge
we are just beginning to understand: the possibility
of substantial regional drought driven by global
climate change. The Amazon region hosts more than
half of the world's remaining tropical forests, and
some parts have among the greatest concentrations of
biodiversity found anywhere on Earth. Overall, the
region is estimated to host about a quarter of all
global biodiversity. It acts as one of the major
'flywheels' of global climate, transpiring water and
generating clouds, affecting atmospheric circulation
across continents and hemispheres, and storing
substantial reserves of biomass and soil
carbon. Hence, the ongoing degradation of Amazonia
is a threat to local climate stability and a
contributor to the global atmospheric climate change
crisis. Conversely, the stabilization of Amazonian
deforestation and degradation would be an
opportunity for local adaptation to climate change,
as well as a potential global contributor towards
mitigation of climate change. However, addressing
deforestation in the Amazon raises substantial
challenges in policy, governance, sustainability and
economic science. This paper introduces a theme
issue dedicated to a multidisciplinary analysis of
these challenges.},

abstract = {Communicating possible effects of climate change inevitably involves uncertainty. Because people are generally averse to uncertainty, this activity has the potential to undermine effective action more than stimulate it. The present research considered how framing climate change predictions differently might moderate the tendency for uncertainty to undermine individual action. Two studies (Ns. = 88 and 120) show that higher uncertainty combined with a negative frame (highlighting possible losses) decreased individual intentions to behave environmentally. However when higher uncertainty was combined with a positive frame (highlighting the possibility of losses not materializing) this produced stronger intentions to act. Study 2 revealed that these effects of uncertainty were mediated through feelings of efficacy. These results suggest that uncertainty is not an inevitable barrier to action, provided communicators frame climate change messages in ways that trigger caution in the face of uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Over the past half century, the Arctic has warmed at about twice the global rate. The reduction of sea ice and snow cover has contributed to the high-latitude warming, as the maximum of the amplification during autumn is a fingerprint of the ice-albedo feedback. There is evidence that atmospheric water vapor, a greenhouse gas, has increased in the Arctic over the past several decades. Ocean heat fluxes into the Arctic from the North Atlantic and North Pacific have also contributed to the Arctic warming through a reduction of sea ice. Observational and modeling studies suggest that reduced sea ice cover and a warmer Arctic in autumn may affect the middle latitudes by weakening the west-to-east wind speeds in the upper atmosphere, by increasing the frequency of wintertime blocking events that in turn lead to persistence or slower propagation of anomalous temperatures in middle latitudes, and by increasing continental snow cover that can in turn influence the atmospheric circulation. While these effects on middle latitudes have been suggested by some analyses, natural variability has thus far precluded a conclusive demonstration of an impact of the Arctic on mid-latitude weather and climate.},

The presented library iNNvestigate addresses this by providing a common interface and out-of-thebox implementation for many analysis methods, including the reference implementation for PatternNet and PatternAttribution as well as for LRP-methods.

Thus, an important issue for these decision makers, and for organizations that fund climate research, is as follows: what is the scope for narrowing the uncertainty through future investments in climate science? Here, we address this question through analysis of twenty-first-century surface air temperature predictions (shown in Fig. 1) in the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP's) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) mul-timodel dataset, as used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4; Solomon et al. 2007). This analysis is subject to some caveats, which we acknowledge and discuss. FIG. I. Global mean, annual mean, surface air temperature predictions from 15 different global climate models under three different emission scenarios from 2000 to 2100 (thin lines): SRES A2 (red), AIB (green), and Bl (blue), designated as high-, medium-, and low-emissions paths, respectively. The same models forced with historical forcings are shown as the thin gray lines, and the observed global mean temperatures from 1950 to 2007 (Brohan et al. 2006) are shown as the thick black line. The multimodel mean for each emissions scenario is shown with thick colored lines demonstrating how uncertainty in future emissions gives rise to uncertainty in climate predictions. The different scenarios give nearly identical predictions until around 2025, demonstrating the delayed effect of future emissions. Each model has a different response to climate forcings, as seen by the spread in results for one particular scenario (or color). The internal (interannual) variability can be seen superimposed on the trend for any one individual prediction. All temperatures are shown as anomalies from the 1971-2000 mean.},

Previous studies indicate that climate variations in the tropicalPacific contributed tomany mid-latitude climate variations over the early twenty- first century. Here we show using large ensembles of fully coupled, partially coupled and uncoupled model simulations that in northwest North America the winter cooling was primarily a remote response to climate fluctuations in the tropical Pacific. By contrast, in central North America the winter cooling appears to have resulted from a relatively rare fluctuation in mid-latitude circulation thatwas unrelated to the tropical Pacific.

abstract = {The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to explore the sensitivity of the large-scale atmospheric energy and moisture budgets to prescribed changes in Arctic sea ice and sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Observed sea ice fractions and SSTs from 1996 and 2007, representing years of high and low sea ice extent, are used as lower boundary conditions. A pan-Arctic domain extending into the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is used. ERA-Interim reanalysis data from 1994 to 2008 are employed as initial and lateral forcing data for each high and low sea ice simulation. The addition of a third ensemble, with a mixed SST field between years 1996 and 2007 (using 2007 SSTs above 66N and 1996 values below), results in a total of three 15-member ensembles. Results of the simulations show both local and remote responses to reduced sea ice. The local polar cap averaged response is largest in October and November, dominated by increased turbulent heat fluxes resulting in vertically deep heating and moistening of the Arctic atmosphere. This warmer and moister atmosphere is associated with an increase in cloud cover, affecting the surface and atmospheric energy budgets. There is an enhancement of the hydrologic cycle, with increased evaporation in areas of sea ice loss paired with increased precipitation. Most of the Arctic climate response results from within-Arctic changes, although some changes in the hydrologic cycle reflect circulation responses to midlatitude SST forcing, highlighting the general sensitivity of the Arctic climate. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Geophysical Union.

Observational studies overwhelmingly support that AA is contributing to winter continental cooling. Although some model experiments support the observational evidence, most modelling results show little connection between AA and severe midlatitude weather or suggest the export of excess heating from the Arctic to lower latitudes. Divergent conclusions between model and observational studies, and even intramodel studies, continue to obfuscate a clear understanding of how AA is influencing midlatitude weather. Amplified warming in the Arctic has been linked to weather variability in the midlatitudes.

We show that, in the latest generation of models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the open-water period lengthens by 63 days on average with 2 °C of global warming above the 1850-1900 average, and by over 90 days in several Arctic seas. Nearly the entire Arctic, including the Transpolar Sea Route, has at least 3 months of open water per year with 3.5 °C warming, and at least 6 months with 5 °C warming.

abstract = {Seasonal movements of the Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ITCZ) control precipitation patterns and cloud
cover throughout the tropics. In this study we have
reconstructed seasonal and interannual variability
of the eastern Pacific ITCZ from 1984 to 1707 using
subseasonal deltaO-18 analyses on a massive coral
from Secas Island (7-degrees 59'N, 82-degrees 3'W)
in the Gulf of Chiriqui, Panama'. The land area that
drains into the Gulf of Chiriqui has served to
amplify the rainfall effect on nearshore surface
waters and coral deltaO-18 composition. During the
protracted wet season in Panama, the deltaO-18 of
precipitation (deltaO-18ppt) is reduced on average
by 10 parts per thousand and sea surface salinity
(SSS) along the western coast is reduced up to 11
parts per thousand. Calibration of the coral
deltaO-18 from Secas Island against instrumental sea
surface temperature (SST), SSS, precipitation and
deltaO-18(ppt) data indicate that seasonal rainfall
induced variations in seawater deltaO-18 are
responsible for approximately 80{\%} of the annual
deltaO-18 variance. Past El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) events are recorded as minor 0.2
to 0.4 parts per thousand deltaO-18 changes
superimposed on the dominant annual
deltaO-18seawater and salinity variations. The
annual cycle in coral deltaO-18 (average 0.9 parts
per thousand) accounts for the largest component of
variance at 51{\%} and is the direct result of the
annual northward expansion of the eastern Pacific
ITCZ. The regularity of the reconstructed seasonal
ITCZ cycle indicates that over the length of the
record the zone of maximum rainfall in the eastern
Pacific has always expanded north to at least Panama
in every northern hemisphere summer. Significant
interannual and interdecadal deltaO-18 oscillations
occur at average periods near 9, 3-7 (ENSO band), 17
and 33 years (listed in order of decreasing
variance). Over the past 20 years similar decadal
shifts are apparent in coral deltaO-18 from
nearshore in the Gulf of Panama. SST data spanning
the last 40 years show no decadal changes. This
indicates that decadal oscillations in the Gulf of
Chiriqui deltaO-18 record are regional features not
related to SST changes, but are caused by ITCZ
precipitation effects on the deltaO-18 of
seawater. A 9-year period in Panama precipitation
supports this conclusion and provides a potential
link between interannual coral deltaO-18 variations
and ITCZ precipitation. It is also shown that the
period of the average 9-year interannual period in
coral deltaO-18 varies from approximately 7.5 years
to approximately 11.8 years. Variance near 11 years
is strongest throughout the 1800s, however, a poor
direct correlation with sunspot number and solar
irradiance leaves the origin of this interannual
oscillation in question. The deltaO-18 time series
also contains a long-term trend of -0.40 parts per
thousand suggesting an increase in precipitation
and/or SST since the early 1800s. As the Gulf of
Chiriqui coral deltaO-18 time series is the first
paleoclimatic record of past variations in the ITCZ,
other seasonal-resolution reconstructions of the
past behavior of the ITCZ are required to test
whether the interannual and long-term variability
observed in the eastern Pacific ITCZ is more than
regional in scale.},

after 550 A. D., and the period 900 - 1310 A. D. was
drier than the preceding millennium. A weaker
monsoon corresponds with increased El Nino

abstract = {Abstract The theory of sea ice thickness distribution developed by Thorndike et al. has been extended to include sea ice enthalpy distribution. The extended theory conserves both ice mass and thermal energy, in the form of the heat stored in the ice, by jointly solving a thickness-distribution equation and an enthalpy-distribution equation. Both equations have been implemented in a one-dimensional dynamic thermodynamic sea-ice model with 12 ice thickness categories following the numerical procedure of Hibler. The implementation of the enthalpy-distribution equation allows the sea-ice model to account for any changes in the ice thermal energy induced by sea ice processes. As a result, the model is able to conserve not only the ice mass but also its thermal energy in the presence of ice advection, growth, melting, and ridging. Conserving ice thermal energy in a thickness-distribution sea ice model improves the prediction of ice growth, summer ice melt in particular, and therefore ice thickness. Inability to...},

abstract = {Monthly climatologies (1971-2000 monthly averages) for stations in the western United States, obtained from the NOAA/National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), are used to illustrate the spatial variations in the annual cycle of climate. Animated map sequences of temperature and precipitation, their average, intermonthly changes, and the local timing of annual maxima or minima provide a comprehensive spatiotemporal baseline of regional climate. The animated maps illustrate three scales of variation: 1) broadscale patterns related to the annual cycle of insolation and hemispheric-scale atmospheric circulation features; 2) mesoscale patterns related to location on the continent and the influence of specific regional circulation features like those associated with the North American monsoon; and 3) smaller-scale spatial variations, related to the mediation by local physiography of the influence of large-scale circulation. Although most western U.S. stations have temperature maxima in July, a delay occurs at stations along the West Coast and interior Washington, northern Idaho, and Montana. A seesaw pattern of precipitation maxima is evident between coastal areas (winter dominated) and the interior (summer dominated). Cluster analyses of the ratio of monthly-to-annual precipitation values for each station identify regions with similar annual cycles of precipitation. Regions of high spatial heterogeneity in the timing of when precipitation occurs include the northern Rocky Mountains, Utah, Arizona, and northwestern Montana. The superimposition of these three scales of spatial variability leads to steep gradients and, in some regions, considerable spatial heterogeneity in annual precipitation. The regional patterns of precipitation heterogeneity highlight vulnerability to drought, especially in regions of the interior west that do not have a dominant precipitation month or season.

abstract = {Many regions of the world experienced abrupt climate
variability during the last glacial period (75-15
thousand years ago(1,2)). These changes probably
arose from interactions between Northern Hemisphere
ice sheets and circulation in the North Atlantic
Ocean(3), but the rapid and widespread propagation
of these changes requires a large-scale atmospheric
response whose details remain unclear(4-7). Here we
use an oxygen isotope record from a speleothem
collected from the Cave of the Bells, Arizona, USA,
to reconstruct aridity in the southwestern United
States during the last glacial period and
deglaciation. We find that, during this period,
aridity in the southwestern United States and
climate in the North Atlantic region show similar
patterns of variability. Periods of warmth in the
North Atlantic Ocean, such as interstadials and the
Bolling-Allerod warming, correspond to drier
conditions in the southwestern United
States. Conversely, cooler temperatures in the high
latitudes are associated with increased regional
moisture. We propose that interstadial warming of
the North Atlantic Ocean diverted the westerly storm
track northward, perhaps through weakening of the
Aleutian Low, and thereby reduced moisture delivery
to southwestern North America. A similar response to
future warming would exacerbate aridity in this
already very dry region.},

Our results extend previous conclusions that recent Northern Hemisphere surface temperature increases are likely anomalous in a long-term context. Recent warmth appears anomalous for at least the past 1,300 years whether or not tree-ring data are used. If tree-ring data are used, the conclusion can be extended to at least the past 1,700 years, but with additional strong caveats. The reconstructed amplitude of change over past centuries is greater than hitherto reported, with somewhat greater Medieval warmth in the Northern Hemisphere, albeit still not reaching recent levels.},

The CMIP6 multi‐model ensemble mean provides a more realistic estimate of the sensitivity of September Arctic sea‐ice area to a given amount of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and to a given amount of global warming, compared with earlier CMIP experiments. Still, most CMIP6 models fail to simulate at the same time a plausible evolution of sea‐ice area and of global mean surface temperature.

@article{Parker2007,
abstract = {Three prominent quasi-global patterns of variability and change are observed using the Met Office's sea surface temperature (SST) analysis and almost independent night marine air temperature analysis. The first is a global warming signal that is very highly correlated with global mean SST. The second is a decadal to multidecadal fluctuation with some geographical similarity to the El Ni{\~{n}}o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It is associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and its Pacific-wide manifestation has been termed the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). We present model investigations of the relationship between the IPO and ENSO. The third mode is an interhemispheric variation on multidecadal timescales which, in view of climate model experiments, is likely to be at least partly due to natural variations in the thermohaline circulation. Observed climatic impacts of this mode also appear in model simulations. Smaller-scale, regional atmospheric phenomena also affect climate on decadal to interdecadal timescales. We concentrate on one such mode, the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This shows strong decadal to interdecadal variability and a correspondingly strong influence on surface climate variability which is largely additional to the effects of recent regional anthropogenic climate change. The winter NAO is likely influenced by both SST forcing and stratospheric variability. A full understanding of decadal changes in the NAO and European winter climate may require a detailed representation of the stratos here that is hitherto missing in the major climate models used to study climate change.},

reported here from the Heron Island coral. This
value is low compared to those observed in other
areas of the ocean [Druffel 1997; Druffel and
Linick, 1978; Nozaki et al., 1978] between 1880 and
1955. Third, we report alterations in the
correlation between Fl Nino events and the
occurrence of low Delta(14)C, which is indicative of
long-term change(s) in circulation in the SW
Pacific. The Delta(14)C shifts reported here are not
large, but even small temporal changes in prebomb
Delta(14)C suggest that important changes in the

These events have decreasing September ice extent trends that are typically 4 times larger than comparable observed trends. One event exhibits a decrease from 6 million km2 to 2 million km2 in a decade, reaching near ice-free September conditions by 2040. In the simulations, ice retreat accelerates as thinning increases the open water formation efficiency for a given melt rate and the ice-albedo feedback increases shortwave absorption. The retreat is abrupt when ocean heat transport to the Arctic is rapidly increasing. Analysis from multiple climate models and three forcing scenarios indicates that abrupt reductions occur in simulations from over 50{\%} of the models and suggests that reductions in future greenhouse gas emissions moderate the likelihood of these events.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Initial-condition large ensembles with ensemble sizes ranging from 30 to 100 members have become a commonly used tool for quantifying the forced response and internal variability in various components of the climate system. However, there is no consensus on the ideal or even sufficient ensemble size for a large ensemble. Here, we introduce an objective method to estimate the required ensemble size that can be applied to any given application and demonstrate its use on the examples of global mean near-surface air temperature, local temperature and precipitation, and variability in the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) region and central United States for the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE). Estimating the required ensemble size is relevant not only for designing or choosing a large ensemble but also for designing targeted sensitivity experiments with a model. Where possible, we base our estimate of the required ensemble size on the pre-industrial control simulation, which is available for every model. We show that more ensemble members are needed to quantify variability than the forced response, with the largest ensemble sizes needed to detect changes in internal variability itself. Finally, we highlight that the required ensemble size depends on both the acceptable error to the user and the studied quantity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Varve thicknesses relate most strongly to total annual discharge (r2=0.75, n=43, p{\textless}0.0001). Maximum annual grain size depends most strongly on maximum spring daily discharge (r2=0.63, n=43, p{\textless}0.0001) and maximum annual daily discharge (r2=0.61, n=43, p{\textless}0.0001), while varve thickness is poorly correlated with maximum annual grain size (r2=0.004, n=287, p=0.33). Relations between varve thickness and annual climate variables (temperature, precipitation, North Pacific (NP) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) indices) are insignificant. On multidecadal timescales, however, regime shifts in varve thickness and total annual discharge coincide with shifts in NP and PDO indices. Periods with increased varve thickness and total annual discharge were associated with warm PDO phases and a strengthened Aleutian Low. The varve-inferred record of PDO suggests that any periodicity in the PDO varied over time, and that the early 19th century marked a transition to a more frequent or detectable shifts.},

Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) for
1958 to 2001, adjusted for bias over the southern
oceans prior to 1.979, an analysis is made of global
patterns of monthly mean anomalies of atmospheric
mass, which is approximately conserved globally. It
differs from previous analyses of atmospheric
circulation by effectively area weighting surface or
sea level pressure that diminishes the role of high
latitudes. To examine whether global patterns of
behavior exist requires analysis of all seasons
together (as opposite seasons occur in each
hemisphere). Empirical orthogonal function (EOF)
analysis, R-mode varimax-rotated EOF analysis, and
cyclostationary EOF (CSEOF) analysis tools are used
to explore patterns and variability on interannual
and longer time scales. Clarification is given of
varimax terminology and procedures that have been
previously misinterpreted. The dominant global
monthly variability overall is associated with the
Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM), which is
active in all months of the year. However, it is not
very coherent from month to month and exhibits a
great deal of natural unforced variability. The
third most important pattern is the Northern
Hemisphere annular mode (NAM) and associated North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which is the equivalent
Northern Hemisphere expression. Neither of these is
really a global mode, although they covary on long
time scales in association with tropical or external
forcing. For monthly data, the second mode is
coherent with Nino-3.4 sea surface temperatures and
thus corresponds to El Nino-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO), which is truly global in extent. It exhibits
more coherent evolution with time and projects
strongest onto the interannual variability, where it
stands out by far as the dominant mode in the CSEOF
analysis. The CSEOF analysis extracts the patterns
phase locked with annual cycle and reveals their
evolution throughout the year. Standard EOF and
varimax analyses are not able to evolve with time of
year unless the analysis is stratified by
season. Varimax analysis is able to extract the SAM,
NAM, and ENSO modes very well, however.},

abstract = {(2019) demonstrate a technique for forecast of opportunity identification through the utilization of expected skill from a linear inverse model. The study demonstrates the ability of the linear statistical model to identify forecasts of opportunity, and raises the question of whether other statistical models, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), can identify forecasts of opportunity for subseasonal prediction. ANNs are very good at nonlinear function estimation (Chen {\&} Chen, 1995), and thus, may be able to identify both linear and nonlinear relationships that lend predictability. Recently, neural networks have been successfully applied to seasonal prediction of meteorological variables such as monthly rainfall (Abbot {\&} Marohasy, 2014) and surface temperature (Toms et al., 2020) as well as yearly prediction of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (Ham et al., 2019), suggesting neural networks may be useful for identifying subseasonal forecasts of opportunity as well. In this paper, we test whether an ANN can be used for subseasonal forecast of opportunity identification. To do so, we input tropical outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies into an ANN and task the network to predict the sign of 500 hPa geopotential height (z500) anomalies in the North Atlantic (40°N, 325°E) 22 days later (e.g., Week 4). Tropical OLR is used to explore the ability of an ANN to identify known relationships between the MJO and the North Atlantic via tropical-extratropical teleconnections (e.g., Cassou, 2008; Hen-derson et al., 2016). We demonstrate that an ANN can identify subseasonal forecasts of opportunity related to tropical OLR, and through an ANN explainability technique, demonstrate that the ANN identifies these known MJO-like OLR patterns. In addition, we find a possible new tropical OLR pattern associated with predictable behavior of the North Atlantic circulation on subseasonal timescales.},

abstract = {A short nontechnical review of the Fl Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and the associated
teleconnections to higher latitudes is given. ENSO
has been shown to be predictable to some degree for
over a year ahead, which therefore provides a basis
for skillful prediction of interannual variations in
climate. The processes involved are emphasized in
order to highlight the areas where future research
may most profitably be directed to improve climate
forecasts. This progress has been realized through
the successful completion of the Tropical Oceans
Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Program of the World
Climate Research Program (WCRP), which has
established and maintained the TOGA Observing
System, developed coupled atmosphere-ocean models of
the tropical Pacific Ocean, demonstrated the
predictive capabilities noted above, and conducted
field programs to further the understanding of
physical processes. Future research will take place
in the context of a developing infrastructure
associated with operational climate
forecasts. Shea-term climate variability involves
much more than ENSO, and the challenge is to also
capitalize on long timescales associated with
anomalies in other parts of the climate system and
any additional predictability that goes beyond
simple persistence and build this into any
prediction scheme. The international framework for
helping to facilitate future research is
CLIVAR-GOALS, the WCRP program on climate
variability and predictability, and the subprogram
an the Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System. The
research challenges are many, but the prospects are
excellent for making further advances and the
potential is high for socioeconomic benefits for
many countries. Turning skillful but uncertain
forecasts into useful information and beneficial
decisions represents a particular challenge, so that
collaboration will be required between the physical
scientists and scientists from the applications and
social science communities.},

Yet large year-to-year fluctuations are also present in the September SIE and the mechanisms for this variability are still not clear. Here we address this issue by examining the preconditions in meteorological fields in the previous spring and summer from observations and a large ensemble of historical climate model simulations. The focus of this study is on the impact of anomalous moisture transport into the Arctic and the associated surface energy fluxes on the September SIE. We find that the below-normal September SIE is associated with enhanced moisture transport into the Arctic in spring, which induces downward thermal radiation at the surface. However, in summer, the anomalous moisture transport over the Arctic is divergent due to an anticyclonic atmospheric flow pattern and the ice albedo feedback plays a leading role in sea ice loss.},

However, individual realizations do show a relationship as observed. We find that the internal variability of BKS sea ice is the main factor between realizations that reproduce the ENSO-BKS correlation and those that do not. Furthermore, we find that atmospheric model simulations prescribed with observed sea ice variability reproduce the ENSO-BKS correlation. We conclude that ENSO-correlated winter BKS temperature variations are dependent on coincidental sea ice changes.},

abstract = {Consistent satellite image time series are increasingly accessible to geoscientists, allowing an effective monitoring of environmental phenomena. Specifically, the use of vegetation index time series has pushed forward the monitoring of large-scale vegetation phenology. Most of these studies derive key phenological metrics from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series on a per-pixel basis. This paper demonstrates an approach to analyze synoptic spatiotemporal phenological patterns over large areas, rather than per pixel. The selected approach involves data mining using a self-organizing map (SOM) and Sammon's projection. To illustrate our approach, we trained a SOM using 13 years of ten-day NDVI composites from the Syst{\`{e}}me Pour l'Observation de la Terre-VEGETATION over the Kruger National Park, South Africa. This resulted in a topologically ordered set of phenological synoptic states. The Sammon's projection was then used to create a simplified representation of the trained SOM that reflects the similarities among the synoptic states. Subsequently, we depicted phenological trajectories for each vegetation season to show how phenological development changes between years. This time series data mining approach provides a holistic characterization of the main regional phenological dynamics and effectively summarizes the information present in the time series, thus facilitating further interpretation.},

abstract = {Extratropical cyclones are storm systems that are observed to travel preferentially within confined regions known as storm tracks. They contribute to precipitation, wind and temperature extremes in mid-latitudes. Cyclones tend to form where surface temperature gradients are large, and the jet stream influences their speed and direction of travel. Storm tracks shape the global climate through transport of energy and momentum. The intensity and location of storm tracks varies seasonally, and in response to other natural variations, such as changes in tropical sea surface temperature. A hierarchy of numerical models of the atmosphere-ocean system-from highly idealized to comprehensive-has been used to study and predict responses of storm tracks to anthropogenic climate change. The future position and intensity of storm tracks depend on processes that alter temperature gradients. However, different processes can have opposing influences on temperature gradients, which leads to a tug of war on storm track responses and makes future projections more difficult. For example, as climate warms, surface shortwave cloud radiative changes increase the Equator-To-pole temperature gradient, but at the same time, longwave cloud radiative changes reduce this gradient. Future progress depends on understanding and accurately quantifying the relative influence of such processes on the storm tracks.},

abstract = {The decline of Arctic sea ice has been documented in over 30 y of satellite passive microwave observations. The resulting darkening of the Arctic and its amplification of global warming was hypothesized almost 50 y ago but has yet to be verified with direct observations. This study uses satellite radiation budget measurements along with satellite microwave sea ice data to document the Arctic-wide decrease in planetary albedo and its amplifying effect on the warming. The analysis reveals a striking relationship between planetary albedo and sea ice cover, quantities inferred from two independent satellite instruments. We find that the Arctic planetary albedo has decreased from 0.52 to 0.48 between 1979 and 2011, corresponding to an additional 6.4 ± 0.9 W/m(2) of solar energy input into the Arctic Ocean region since 1979. Averaged over the globe, this albedo decrease corresponds to a forcing that is 25{\%} as large as that due to the change in CO2 during this period, considerably larger than expectations from models and other less direct recent estimates. Changes in cloudiness appear to play a negligible role in observed Arctic darkening, thus reducing the possibility of Arctic cloud albedo feedbacks mitigating future Arctic warming.},

As Earth approaches 2°C warming, the Arctic and Antarctic may reach 4°C and 2°C mean annual warming, and 7°C and 3°C winter warming, respectively. Expected consequences of increased Arctic warming include ongoing loss of land and sea ice, threats to wildlife and traditional human livelihoods, increased methane emissions, and extreme weather at lower latitudes. With low biodiversity, Antarctic ecosystems may be vulnerable to state shifts and species invasions. Land ice loss in both regions will contribute substantially to global sea level rise, with up to 3 m rise possible if certain thresholds are crossed. Mitigation efforts can slow or reduce warming, but without them northern high latitude warming may accelerate in the next two to four decades.

abstract = {The expressiveness principle for visualization design asserts that a visualization should encode all of the available data, and only the available data, implying that continuous data types should be visualized with a continuous encoding channel. And yet, in many domains binning continuous data is not only pervasive, but it is accepted as standard practice. Prior work provides no clear guidance for when encoding continuous data continuously is preferable to employing binning techniques or how this choice affects data interpretation and decision making. In this paper, we present a study aimed at better understanding the conditions in which the expressiveness principle can or should be violated for visualizing continuous data. We provided participants with visualizations employing either continuous or binned greyscale encodings of geospatial elevation data and compared participants' ability to complete a wide variety of tasks. For various tasks, the results indicate significant differences in decision making, confidence in responses, and task completion time between continuous and binned encodings of the data. In general, participants with continuous encodings were faster to complete many of the tasks, but never outperformed those with binned encodings, while performance accuracy with binned encodings was superior to continuous encodings in some tasks. These findings suggest that strict adherence to the expressiveness principle is not always advisable. We discuss both the implications and limitations of our results and outline various avenues for potential work needed to further improve guidelines for using continuous versus binned encodings for continuous data types.},

These crops are an important component of the region's rural economy with an estimated value of {\$}1.8 billion in 2012. More profitable per-acre than many row crops, specialty crops also have higher production-related risks. They are generally more sensitive to climatic stressors and require more comprehensive management compared to traditional row crops. Temperature and precipitation fluctuations across the Midwest directly impact specialty crop production quantity and quality and indirectly influence the timing of crucial farm operations and the economic impacts of pests, weeds, and diseases. Increasingly variable weather and climate change pose a serious threat to specialty crop production in the Midwest. In this article, we assess how climate variability and observed climatic trends are impacting Midwestern specialty crop production using USDA Risk Management Agency data. In addition, we review current trends in grower perceptions of risks associated with a changing climate and assess sustainable adaptation strategies. Our results indicate that weather-induced losses vary by state with excessive moisture resulting in the highest total number of claims across all Midwestern states followed by freeze and drought events. Overall, specialty crop growers are aware of the increased production risk under a changing climate and have identified the need for crop-specific weather, production, and financial risk management tools and increased crop insurance coverage.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN), a type of deep-learning method, to predict next-hour tornado occurrence. Predictors are a storm-centered radar image and a proximity sounding from the Rapid Refresh model. Radar images come from the Multiyear Reanalysis of Remotely Sensed Storms (MYRORSS) and Gridded NEXRAD WSR-88D Radar dataset (GridRad), both of which are multiradar composites. We train separate CNNs on MYRORSS and GridRad data, present an experiment to optimize the CNN settings, and evaluate the chosen CNNs on independent testing data. Both models achieve an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) well above 0.9, which is considered to be excellent performance. The GridRad model achieves a critical success index (CSI) of 0.31, and the MYRORSS model achieves a CSI of 0.17. The difference is due primarily to event frequency (percentage of storms that are tornadic in the next hour), which is 3.52{\%} for GridRad but only 0.24{\%} for MYRORSS. The best CNN predictions (true positives and negatives) occur for strongly rotating tornadic supercells and weak nontornadic cells in mesoscale convective systems, respectively. The worst predictions (false positives and negatives) occur for strongly rotating nontornadic supercells and tornadic cells in quasilinear convective systems, respectively. The performance of our CNNs is comparable to an operational machine-learning system for severe weather prediction, which suggests that they would be useful for real-time forecasting.},

abstract = {Heat and rainfall extremes have intensified over the past few decades and this trend is projected to continue with future global warming1–3. A long persistence of extreme events often leads to societal impacts with warm-and-dry conditions severely affecting agriculture and consecutive days of heavy rainfall leading to flooding. Here we report systematic increases in the persistence of boreal summer weather in a multi-model analysis of a world 2 °C above pre-industrial compared to present-day climate. Averaged over the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude land area, the probability of warm periods lasting longer than two weeks is projected to increase by 4{\%} (2–6{\%} full uncertainty range) after removing seasonal-mean warming. Compound dry–warm persistence increases at a similar magnitude on average but regionally up to 20{\%} (11–42{\%}) in eastern North America. The probability of at least seven consecutive days of strong precipitation increases by 26{\%} (15–37{\%}) for the mid-latitudes. We present evidence that weakening storm track activity contributes to the projected increase in warm and dry persistence. These changes in persistence are largely avoided when warming is limited to 1.5 °C. In conjunction with the projected intensification of heat and rainfall extremes, an increase in persistence can substantially worsen the effects of future weather extremes.},

abstract = {Water management in Australia has traditionally been
carried out on the assumption that the historical
record of rainfall, evaporation, streamflow, and
recharge is representative of current and future
climatic conditions. However, in many circumstances,
this does not adequately address the potential risks
to supply security for towns, industry, irrigators,
and the environment. This is because the Australian
climate varies markedly due to natural cycles that
operate over periods of several years to several
decades. There is also serious concern about how
anthropogenic climate change may exacerbate drought
risk in the future. In this paper, the frequency and
severity of droughts are analyzed during a range of
"climate states'' (e.g., different phases of the
Pacific, Indian, and/or Southern Oceans) to
demonstrate that drought risk varies markedly over
interannual through to multidecadal time
scales. Importantly, by accounting for climate
variability and change on multitemporal scales
(e.g., interdecadal, multidecadal, and the palaeo
scale), it is demonstrated that the risk of failure
of current drought management practices may be
better assessed and more robust climate adaptation
responses developed.},

@article{Liu2021a,
abstract = {However, the dynamic model forecasting of the IOD at lead times longer than 3 months exhibits very limited skill, though some studies indicate that predicting the IOD 7 months in advance is theoretically possible (Becker et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2012; Wu {\&} Tang, 2019); this indicates that more meaningful precursors for IOD development must be discovered. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) of deep learning are nonlinear in nature and excel at processing spatial architectures (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; LeCun et al., 2015; Zeiler {\&} Fergus, 2014), for example, SSTA or heat content (HC) patterns, which makes them compatible for unveiling implications between current climate conditions and their ensuing evolution. Furthermore, the successful application of deep learning in climate science, such as multi-year ENSO forecasts (Ham et al., 2019), rainfall prediction (Lee et al., 2018; Sahai et al., 2000), and the downscaling of parameters (Rasp et al., 2018) in climate models, has inspired the authors of the present study to review the significance of statistical methods. Considering deep learning techniques as a new methodology of statistical refinement based on climatic information, this study presents an attempt to forecast the IOD using CNNs with SSTA maps derived from reanalysis data. For comparison , IOD prediction by dynamic models in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) (Kirtman et al., 2014), an experimental multi-model seasonal forecasting system consisting of coupled models from research and operational centers in the USA and Canada (see Section 3), is examined as well. Also note that when it comes to the predictability of the IOD, there has been a long debate concerning the physical relation between ENSO and IOD. Some studies indicate that the IOD is an intrinsic climate variability independent of the ENSO (Behera et al., 2006; Saji et al., 1999; Webster et al., 1999), while some others argue that IOD can be externally forced by ENSO (Stuecker et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019). There is no doubt that the ENSO has its influence on the IOD, but the way in which ENSO operates is still under investigation (to drive the IOD, to enhance/weaken the IOD or both). In addition, the architecture and algorithm of the classic CNN model make it difficult to balance the contribution to the predicted Dipole Mode Index (DMI) between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, if a global SSTA map is used as input (see Supporting Information S1). Thus, as a preliminary exploration of CNN-based IOD forecasts, we initiate the IOD prediction only using the Indian Ocean SSTA in this study. 2. Methods 2.1. Deep Learning Techniques The architecture of CNN applied in this study is shown in Figure S4 in Supporting Information S1. Our CNN model has two convolutional layers and two average pooling layers. The number of filters in each convolutional layer varies from 10 to 12. The average pooling layer extract features in 2 × 2 grid while the filters do in 3 × 3 grid. Subsequent fully connected layer has 8-10 neurons. The final output layer is in one-dimension as a regression is needed to produce a DMI. So there exists 27 combinations of architecture of CNN models, which are C10C10D8, C10C10D9, C10C10D10, C10C11D8, etc. (C and D denote convolu-tional layer and fully connected layer, respectively). The batch (the number of samples we feed the CNN one updating step) of every updating step is 24 (We tried 12, 24, 48, and whole batch. The results are all alike so you can select whichever you prefer.). However, the learning rate (LR) is quite important, which needs to be dealt with carefully. For each one of those 27 CNN models, we apply a range of LR from 0.05 to 0.0001 to train them (the specific LRs are 0.05, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01, 0.009, 0.008, 0.007, 0.006, 0.005, 0.004, 0.003, 0.002, 0.001, 0.0009, 0.0008, 0.0007, 0.0006, 0.0005, and 0.0001). It is clear that different architecture of CNN model favors different LRs to yield their highest skills. After the training period, we choose the model with the highest skill to produce DMI in validation period for each one of those 27 CNN models. Though our test proves that every single CNN model can predict IOD well, the ensemble mean of output of 27 CNN models is still used as the final predicted DMI. The required software for deep learning are Python 3.6, Keras 2.3.0, TensorFlow 2.2.0, NumPy 1.17.0, SciPy 1.4.1, and MATLAB 2018. The required software for plotting figures are Matplotlib 3.0.0 and Basemap 1.2.1.},

abstract = {A detailed description is presented of the statistical patterns of climate forcing of tree growth (annual maximum latewood density and ring-width time series), across a network of 387 specially selected conifer sites that circle the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere. The in uence of summer temperature dominates growth. A mean April-September response is optimum for describing the major forcing signal over the whole densito-metric network, though a shorter June-July season is more relevant in central and eastern Siberia. The ring- width chronologies also have a shorter optimum (June-August) seasonal signal, but this is much weaker than the density signal. The association between tree-ring density and precipitation variability (as measured by partial correlations to account for the correlation between temperature and precipitation) is considerably weaker than with temperature. The ring-width response to precipitation is dominated by noise' and local site in uences, though a negative response to winter precipitation in northern Siberia is consistent with the suggestion of an in uence of delayed snowmelt. Average correlations with winter temperatures are small for all regions and correlations with annual temperatures are positive only because of the strong link with summer temperatures. Reconstructions of summer temperature based on composite regional density chronologies for nine areas are presented. Five regions (northwestern North America, NWNA; eastern and central Canada, ECCA; northern Europe, NEUR; northern Siberia, NSIB; and eastern Siberia, ESIB) constitute an arbitrary northern' division of the network, while the four other regions (western North America, WNA; southern Europe, SEUR; central Asia, CAS; and the Tibetan Plateau, TIBP) make up the southern' part. We also present two larger composite regional reconstructions comprising the data from the five higher-latitude (HILAT) and four lower-latitude (LOLAT) areas respectively; and a single series made up of data from all regions (ALL), which is highly correlated with Northern Hemisphere mean summer temperature. We calculate time-dependent uncertainty ranges for each of these reconstructions, though they are not intended to represent long timescales of tempera ture variability ({\textgreater}100 years) because the technique used to assemble the site chronologies precludes this. Finally, we examine in more detail the reduced sensitivity in the tree-growth data to decadal-timescale summer-temperature trends during the last 50 years, identified in earlier published work.},

of HadCM3LC is used to assess the role of simulated
changes in mid-twenty-first century sea surface

When the full HadCM3LC SST anomalies (SSTAs) are
used, the atmosphere model reproduces the Amazon
Basin climate change exhibited by HadCM3LC,
including much of the reduction in Amazon Basin
rainfall. This rainfall change is shown to be the
combined effect of SSTAs in both the tropical
Atlantic and the Pacific, with roughly equal
contributions from each basin. The greatest rainfall
reduction occurs from May to October, outside of the
mature South American monsoon (SAM) season. This dry
season response is the combined effect of a more
rapid warming of the tropical North Atlantic
relative to the south, and warm SSTAs in the
tropical east Pacific. Conversely, a weak
enhancement of mature SAM season rainfall in
response to Atlantic SST change is suppressed by the
atmospheric response to Pacific SST. This net wet
season response is sufficient to prevent dry season
soil moisture deficits from being recharged through
the SAM season, leading to a perennial soil moisture
reduction and an associated 30{\%} reduction in annual
Amazon Basin net primary productivity (NPP). A
further 23{\%} NPP reduction occurs in response to a

abstract = {In 1990, Andrew Bakun proposed that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations would force intensification of upwelling-favorable winds in eastern boundary current systems that contribute substantial services to society. Because there is considerable disagreement about whether contemporary wind trends support Bakun's hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature on upwelling-favorable wind intensification. The preponderance of published analyses suggests that winds have intensified in the California, Benguela, and Humboldt upwelling systems and weakened in the Iberian system over time scales ranging up to 60 years; wind change is equivocal in the Canary system. Stronger intensification signals are observed at higher latitudes, consistent with the warming pattern associated with climate change. Overall, reported changes in coastal winds, although subtle and spatially variable, support Bakun's hypothesis of upwelling intensification in eastern boundary current systems.},

Here, the dynamics of this teleconnection are investigated using a 100-member ensemble of transient integrations of the GFDL atmospheric general circulation model (AM2). The model is perturbed with a simple persisted snow anomaly over Siberia and is integrated from October through December. Strong surface cooling occurs above the anomalous Siberian snow cover, which produces a tropospheric form stress anomaly associated with the vertical propagation of wave activity. This wave activity response drives wave–mean flow interaction in the lower stratosphere and subsequent downward propagation of a negative-phase northern annular mode response back into the troposphere. A wintertime coupled stratosphere–troposphere response to fall season snow forcing is also found to occur even when the snow forcing itself does not persist into...},

regions of the United Stares and Mexico: Arizona-New
Mexico, northwest Mexico, and southwest
Mexico. Daily observed precipitation over the United
States and Mexico for a 26-yr (1963-88) period and
various fields from the National Centers for
Environmental Prediction-National Center for
Atmospheric Research Reanalysis are used to compare
and contrast hydrologic conditions and atmospheric
circulation features associated with early, late,
wet, and dry monsoons in each region. Relationships
between anomalous monsoon behavior and the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon are
examined. Some factors associated with the
atmosphere's lower boundary conditions that might
influence the interannual variability of the warm
season precipitation regime are discussed. The mean
seasonal evolution of the North American monsoon
system is characterized by the regular northward
progression of heavy precipitation from southern
Mexico by early June to the southwestern United
States by early July. While the seasonal normal
rainfall and its variability are largest in
southwest Mexico, the mean seasonal percent
departure from normal is largest in Arizona-New
Mexico. Wet (dry) monsoons in southwest Mexico tend
to occur during La Nina (El Nino). This association
is attributed, in part, to the impact of local sea
surface temperature anomalies on the land-sea
thermal contrast, hence the strength of the
monsoon. There is also a weak association between
dry monsoons in Arizona-New Mexico (northwest
Mexico) and La Nina (El Nino). Wet summer monsoons
in Arizona-New Mexico tend to follow winters
characterized by dry conditions in the southwestern
United States and vice versa. Although the onset
and duration of the monsoon are guile regular in
each region, the precise dare of onset in a given
region is highly variable and likely to he unrelated
to the date of onset in the other regions. Early
monsoons in Arizona-New Mexico tend to have heavy
seasonal rainfall while late monsoons in northwest
Mexico tend to have deficient seasonal rainfall. The
onset date in southwest Mexico is not related to
seasonal rainfall. However, interannual fluctuations
in rainfall over the entire monsoon region for the
2-month period after onset in southwest Mexico are
highly correlated, suggesting that knowledge of the
starting dare in southwest Mexico may be useful for
analyzing, understanding, and possibly predicting
these fluctuations.},

Our results suggest that Arctic climate has already emerged in sea ice. Air temperatures will emerge under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario in the early- to mid-twenty-first century, followed by precipitation-phase changes.

an international effort to produce a comprehensive
global atmospheric circulation dataset spanning the
twentieth century, assimilating only surface
pressure reports and using observed monthly

boundary conditions. It is chiefly motivated by a
need to provide an observational dataset with
quantified uncertainties for validations of climate
model simulations of the twentieth century onall
time-scales, with emphasis on the statistics of
daily weather. It uses an Ensemble Kalman Filter
data assimilation method with background 'first
guess' fields supplied by an ensemble of forecasts
from a global numerical weather prediction
model. This directly yields a global analysis every
6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere,
and also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis.
The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of
global tropospheric variability, and of the
dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the
present at 6-hourly temporal and 2 degrees spatial
resolutions. Intercomparisons with independent
radiosonde data indicate that the reanalyses are
generally of high quality. The quality in the
extratropical Northern Hemisphere throughout the
century is similar to that of current three-day
operational NWP forecasts. Intercomparisons over the
second half-century of these surface-based
reanalyses with other reanalyses that also make use
of upper-air and satellite data are equally
encouraging. It is anticipated that the 20CR

Simple theories suggest that global warming will reduce the strength of the mean tropical atmospheric circulation. An important aspect of this tropical circulation is a large-scale zonal (east-west) overturning of air across the equatorial Pacific Ocean--driven by convection to the west and subsidence to the east--known as the Walker circulation. Here we explore changes in tropical Pacific circulation since the mid-nineteenth century using observations and a suite of global climate model experiments. Observed Indo-Pacific sea level pressure reveals a weakening of the Walker circulation. The size of this trend is consistent with theoretical predictions, is accurately reproduced by climate model simulations and, within the climate models, is largely due to anthropogenic forcing. The climate model indicates that the weakened surface winds have altered the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical Pacific Ocean. These results support model projections of further weakening of tropical atmospheric circulation during the twenty-first century.},

abstract = {The question of which statistical model best
describes internal climate variability on
interannual and longer time scales is essential to
the ability to predict such variables and detect
periodicities and trends in them. For over 30 yr the
dominant model for background climate variability
has been the autoregressive model of the first order
(AR1). However, recent research has shown that some
aspects of climate variability are best described by
a "long memory" or "power-law" model. Such a model
fits a temporal spectrum to a single power-law
function, which thereby accumulates more power at
lower frequencies than an AR1 fit. In this study,
several power-law model estimators are applied to
global temperature data from reanalysis
products. The methods employed (the detrended
fluctuation analysis, Geweke-Porter-Hudak estimator,
Gaussian semiparametric estimator, and multitapered
versions of the last two) agree well for pure
power-law stochastic processes. However, for the
observed temperature record, the power-law fits are
sensitive to the choice of frequency range and the
intrinsic filtering properties of the methods. The
observational results converge once frequency ranges
are made consistent and the lowest frequencies are
included, and once several climate signals have been
filtered. Two robust results emerge from the
analysis: first, that the tropical circulation
features relatively large power-law exponents that
connect to the zonal-mean extratropical circulation;
and second, that the subtropical lower stratosphere
exhibits power-law behavior that is volcanically
forced.},

abstract = {The Earth's climate is rapidly changing. Over the past centuries, aerosols, via their ability to absorb or scatter solar radiation and alter clouds, played an important role in counterbalancing some of the greenhouse gas (GHG) caused global warming. The multicentury anthropogenic aerosol cooling effect prevented present-day climate from reaching even higher surface air temperatures and subsequent more dramatic climate impacts. Trends in aerosol concentrations and optical depth show that in many polluted regions such as Europe and the United States, aerosol precursor emissions decreased back to levels of the 1950s. More recent polluting countries such as China may have reached a turning point in recent years as well, while India still follows an upward trend. Here we study aerosol trends in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations of the GISS ModelE2.1 climate model using a fully coupled atmosphere composition configuration, including interactive gas-phase chemistry and either an aerosol microphysical (MATRIX) or a mass-based (One-Moment Aerosol, OMA) aerosol module. Results show that whether global aerosol radiative forcing is already declining depends on the aerosol scheme used. Using the aerosol microphysical scheme, where the aerosol system reacts more strongly to the trend in sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, global peak direct aerosol forcing was reached in the 1980s, whereas the mass-based scheme simulates peak direct aerosol forcing around 2010.},

climate change is complicated because non-climatic
influences dominate local, short-term biological
changes. Any underlying signal from climate change
is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek
systematic trends across diverse species and
geographic regions; however, debates within the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
reveal several definitions of a `systematic
trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply
diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and
show that recent biological trends match climate
change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented
significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade
towards the poles ( or metres per decade upward),
and significant mean advancement of spring events by
2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic
fingerprint of temporal and spatial `sign-switching'
responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century
climate trends. Among appropriate
long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this
diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279
species. This suite of analyses generates `very high
confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate
change is already affecting living systems.},

based methodologies are developed and applied to
isolate the climate impacts of three known sources

marine air masses over the high-latitude continents
during winter, and aerosols injected into the
stratosphere by explosive volcanic eruptions. After
the effects of ENSO and high-latitude temperature
advection are removed from the global-mean
temperature record, the signatures of volcanic
eruptions and changes in instrumentation become more
clearly apparent. After the volcanic eruptions are
subsequently filtered from the record, the residual
time series reveals a nearly monotonic global
warming pattern since similar to 1950. The results
also reveal coupling between the land and ocean
areas on the interannual time scale that transcends
the effects of ENSO and volcanic eruptions. Globally

strongly correlated when ocean leads land by; 2-3
months. These coupled fluctuations exhibit a

abstract = {High- resolution speleothem records from China have
provided insights into the factors that control the
strength of the East Asian monsoon(1-4). Our
understanding of these factors remains incomplete,
however, owing to gaps in the record of monsoon
history over the past two interglacial - glacial
cycles. In particular, missing sections have
hampered our ability to test ideas about orbital-
scale controls on the monsoon(5-7), the causes of
millennial- scale events(8,9) and relationships
between changes in the monsoon and climate in other
regions. Here we present an absolute- dated oxygen
isotope record from Sanbao cave, central China, that
completes a Chinese-cave-based record of the
strength of the East Asian monsoon that covers the
past 224,000 years. The record is dominated by
23,000-year- long cycles that are synchronous within
dating errors with summer insolation at 65 degrees N
(ref. 10), supporting the idea that tropical/
subtropical monsoons respond dominantly and directly
to changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation
on orbital timescales(5). The cycles are punctuated
by millennial- scale strong-summer-monsoon events
(Chinese interstadials(1)), and the new record
allows us to identify the complete series of these
events over the past two interglacial - glacial
cycles. Their duration decreases and their frequency
increases during glacial build- up in both the last
and penultimate glacial periods, indicating that ice
sheet size affects their character and pacing. The
ages of the events are exceptionally well
constrained and may thus serve as benchmarks for
correlating and calibrating climate records.},

Here we show that the deep heat penetration in these two basins is not unique to the hiatus but is characteristic of anthropogenic warming and merely reflects the depth of the mean meridional overturning circulation in the basin. We find, however, that heat redistribution in the upper 350 m between the Pacific and Indian Oceans is closely tied to the surface warming hiatus. The Indian Ocean shows an anomalous warming below 50 m during hiatus events due to an enhanced heat transport by the Indonesian throughflow in response to the intensified trade winds in the equatorial Pacific. Thus, the Pacific and Indian Oceans are the key regions to track ocean heat uptake during the surface warming hiatus. Mechanisms for the warming hiatus are inferred by tracking regional ocean heat uptake in different regions. Here, the authors show that the Indo-Pacific heat redistribution holds the key while the abyssal heat uptake in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans primarily reflects the downward penetration of anthropogenic heat.},

Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species{\AE} ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level},

abstract = {A 3000-year varve-thickness record from Hv{\'{i}}t{\'{a}}rvatn, a glacier-dominated lake in central Iceland, preserves inter-annual variations in the delivery of glacially eroded sediment to the lake. The first-order low-frequency trend in varve thickness reflects increased glacial erosion through the Late Holocene, reaching a peak during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Superimposed on this trend are large inter-annual to decadal fluctuations in varve thickness that we suggest reflect variability in climate parameters that determine the efficiency of the fluvial transport system to deliver glacially eroded sediment to the lake each year. We use spectral analysis to test whether regular high-frequency cyclicity in varve thickness exists in the 3-ka record after removing the low-frequency variability. Spectral analyses from three sediment cores recovered from the lake show essentially the same periods of 2.8–3.4, 13, 35–40 and 85–93, for the overlapping ∼900-year period. Additionally, cycles of 55, 130 and 290 years are found in the spectrum for the 3000-year record that do not show up in the spectra for the shorter cores. Some of these cycles show similar variability to those of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). This relationship is supported by a significant correlation between varve thickness and both the NAO (precipitation) and AMO (summer temperature) indices over the 180-year instrumental period. NAO cyclicities (2–15 years) are weakly expressed in the first half of the record, increase between 600 and 1000 AD, decrease in strength during medieval time, and are most strongly expressed between 1300 AD and the early 20th century. AMO cyclicities (50 to 130 years) are also relatively weak in the first half of the record, becoming quite strong between 600 and 1000 AD and again between 1100 and 1500 AD, but are essentially absent through the peak of the LIA, between 1500 and 1900 AD, a time when strong cyclicities of about 35 years appear.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal patterns of recent (1979-2008) air temperature trends are evaluated using three reanalysis datasets and radiosonde data. Our analysis demonstrates large discrepancies between the reanalysis datasets, possibly due to differences in the data assimilation procedures as well as sparseness and inhomogeneity of high-latitude observations. We test the robustness of arctic tropospheric warming based on the ERA-40 dataset. ERA-40 Arctic atmosphere temperatures tend to be closer to the observed ones in terms of root mean square error compared to other reanalysis products used in the article. However, changes in the ERA-40 data assimilation procedure produce unphysical jumps in atmospheric temperatures, which may be the likely reason for the elevated tropospheric warming trend in 1979-2002. NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data show that the near-surface upward temperature trend over the same period is greater than the tropospheric trend, which is consistent with direct radiosonde observations and inconsistent with ERA-40 results. A change of sign in the winter temperature trend from negative to positive in the late 1980s is documented in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere with a maximum over the Canadian Arctic, based on radiosonde data. This change from cooling to warming tendency is associated with weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex and shift of its center toward the Siberian coast and possibly can be explained by the changes in the dynamics of the Arctic Oscillation. This temporal pattern is consistent with multi-decadal variations of key arctic climate parameters like, for example, surface air temperature and oceanic freshwater content. Elucidating the mechanisms behind these changes will be critical to understanding the complex nature of high-latitude variability and its impact on global climate change. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Although these methods perform impressively well, they have a significant disadvantage, the lack of transparency, limiting the interpretability of the solution and thus the scope of application in practice. Especially DNNs act as black boxes due to their multilayer nonlinear structure. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for interpreting generic multilayer neural networks by decomposing the network classification decision into contributions of its input elements. Although our focus is on image classification, the method is applicable to a broad set of input data, learning tasks and network architectures. Our method called deep Taylor decomposition efficiently utilizes the structure of the network by backpropagating the explanations from the output to the input layer. We evaluate the proposed method empirically on the MNIST and ILSVRC data sets.},

homogeneous by compensating satellite

abstract = {Abstract Climate in the North Pacific and North American sectors has experienced interdecadal shifts during the twentieth century. A network of recently developed tree-ring chronologies for Southern and Baja California extends the instrumental record and reveals decadal-scale variability back to 1661. The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) is closely matched by the dominant mode of tree-ring variability that provides a preliminary view of multiannual climate fluctuations spanning the past four centuries. The reconstructed PDO index features a prominent bidecadal oscillation, whose amplitude weakened in the late l700s to mid-1800s. A comparison with proxy records of ENSO suggests that the greatest decadal-scale oscillations in Pacific climate between 1706 and 1977 occurred around 1750, 1905, and 1947.},

@article{Cook2009,
abstract = {North Pacific climate variability is characterized by pronounced band-limited multi-decadal (e.g., 20-40 years) variability and apparent regime shifts in instrumental sea level pressure and sea surface temperature (SST) records. This variability is commonly expressed in index form as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The state of the PDO has strong impacts on local climate along the North Pacific Rim, as well as on climate downstream across large parts of North America. The PDO is based on SST records that only extend back to the mid-19th century at best, with the most commonly used version of the index beginning in 1900. Robustly characterizing multi-decadal variability in such short records is a serious statistical challenge. In addition, the observed behavior of the PDO may be significantly contaminated by the effects of greenhouse warming, especially during the latter half of the 20th century. This makes the description of the PDO as a long-term natural mode of North Pacific climate variability uncertain as well. Annually resolved and exactly dated tree-ring records from western North America and sensitive to north Pacific climate variability and change can be used to extend the short instrumental PDO back several centuries to a millennium now. Several such PDO reconstructions exist now, each with robustly expressed long-term, band-limited, multi-decadal variability similar to that found in the instrumental data, but they do not all agree in the pre-1900 period not used for calibration. This appears to be due to systematic low-frequency differences between PDO reconstructions depending on the geographic locations of the tree-ring chronologies used, principally those north and south of 40°N. These differences appear to come and go back in time at near-centennial time scales. This suggests that the spatial impact of the PDO on North American climate varies over time in ways not possible to discern from the instrumental data. It also suggests that care must be taken in selecting which published PDO reconstruction is used for further studies of North Pacific climate variability.},

average annual calcification. Records ranged from 49
to 507 years in length. The period common to all
colonies was 1934-1982. Annual growth data were
averaged over periods of at least 5 years to avoid
problems associated with dating of records and with
measurement techniques. This also made some
allowance for distortion of environmental

into the environmental signal of information
associated with skeletal architecture. The period

Instrumental records of sea surface temperature

calcification, averaged across these 10 cores, was
significantly related to SST. Thus, average annual
calcification for these 10 colonies provides a proxy
for SST variations on the CBR back to the 18th
century. Interpretation of evidence of a recent
decline in calcification of Porites of the GBR is
tempered by (1) evidence of similar declines and
recoveries over the past several centuries and (2)
evidence that coral calcification on the GBR has:
been above the long-term average for most of this

are analyzed using a soil moisture-based drought
index over global terrestrial areas, excluding
Greenland and Antarctica. The soil moisture fields
are derived from a simulation of the terrestrial
hydrologic cycle driven by a hybrid
reanalysis-observation forcing dataset. Drought is
described in terms of various statistics that
summarize drought duration, intensity, and
severity. There is an overall small wetting trend in
global soil moisture, forced by increasing
precipitation, which is weighted by positive soil
moisture trends over the Western Hemisphere and
especially in North America. Regional variation is
nevertheless apparent, and significant drying over
West Africa, as driven by decreasing Sahel
precipitation, stands out. Elsewhere, Europe appears
to have not experienced significant changes in soil
moisture, a trait shared by Southeast and southern
Asia. Trends in drought duration, intensity, and
severity are predominantly decreasing, but
statistically significant changes are limited in
areal extent, of the order of 1.0{\%}-7.0{\%} globally,
depending on the variable and drought threshold, and
are generally less than 10{\%} of continental
areas. Concurrent changes in drought spatial extent
are evident, with a global decreasing trend of
between -0.021{\%} and -0.035{\%} yr(-1). Regionally,
drought spatial extent over Africa has increased and
is dominated by large increases over West
Africa. Northern and East Asia show positive trends,
and central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau show
decreasing trends. In South Asia all trends are
insignificant. Drought extent over Australia has
decreased. Over the Americas, trends are uniformly
negative and mostly significant. Within the
long-term trends there are considerable interannual
and decadal variations in soil moisture and drought
characteristics for most regions, which impact the
robustness of the trends. Analysis of detrended and
smoothed soil moisture time series reveals that the
leading modes of variability are associated with sea
surface temperatures, primarily in the equatorial
Pacific and secondarily in the North
Atlantic. Despite the overall wetting trend there is
a switch since the 1970s to a drying trend, globally
and in many regions, especially in high northern
latitudes. This is shown to be caused, in part, by
concurrent increasing temperatures. Although drought
is driven primarily by variability in precipitation,
projected continuation of temperature increases
during the twenty-first century indicate the
potential for enhanced drought occurrence.},

Within the past 15 years this region has experienced Hurricane Isabel in 2003, Hurricane Irene in 2011 and several tropical storms. The region was also impacted by post-tropical Sandy in 2012. The perception of hurricane hazards among residents of the mid-Atlantic region has not been directly researched. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on the comprehension of information from hurricane warning graphics that influences hazard perception. This research used a total of eight hypothetical scenarios (four pairs) that varied storm track and storm size to assess risk perception of hurricane hazards and characteristics. Each scenario was represented using a four-panelled map featuring the National Hurricane Center's cone of uncertainty, a new storm surge map and a new damaging wind map created by the authors. A Qualtrics survey was used to collect responses to questions about concern for personal harm and evacuation intent. Residents of the region perceived falling trees, potential for damaging winds and the size of the storm to be the greatest threats. Scenarios depicting larger storms with track lines that moved inland were seen as more hazardous, resulting in greater concern and evacuation intent. Coastal residents showed greater concern about distance from the track for all scenarios and greater evacuation intent for larger storms compared to inland residents.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. A better understanding of the role of sea ice for the changing climate of our planet is the central aim of the diagnostic Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6)-endorsed Sea-Ice Model Intercomparison Project (SIMIP). To reach this aim, SIMIP requests sea-ice-related variables from climate-model simulations that allow for a better understanding and, ultimately, improvement of biases and errors in sea-ice simulations with large-scale climate models. This then allows us to better understand to what degree CMIP6 model simulations relate to reality, thus improving our confidence in answering sea-ice-related questions based on these simulations. Furthermore, the SIMIP protocol provides a standard for sea-ice model output that will streamline and hence simplify the analysis of the simulated sea-ice evolution in research projects independent of CMIP. To reach its aims, SIMIP provides a structured list of model output that allows for an examination of the three main budgets that govern the evolution of sea ice, namely the heat budget, the momentum budget, and the mass budget. In this contribution, we explain the aims of SIMIP in more detail and outline how its design allows us to answer some of the most pressing questions that sea ice still poses to the international climate-research community.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The polar region has been one of the fastest warming places on Earth in response to greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. Two distinct processes contribute to the observed warming signal: (i) local warming in direct response to the GHG forcing and (ii) the effect of enhanced poleward heat transport from low latitudes. A series of aquaplanet experiments, which excludes the surface albedo feedback, is conducted to quantify the relative contributions of these two physical processes to the polar warming magnitude and degree of amplification relative to the global mean. The globe is divided into zonal bands with equal area in eight experiments. For each of these, an external heating is prescribed beneath the slab ocean layer in the respective forcing bands. The summation of the individual temperature responses to each local heating in these experiments is very similar to the response to a globally uniform heating. This allows the authors to decompose the polar warming and amplification signal into the effects of local and remote heating. Local polar heating that induces surface-trapped warming due to the large tropospheric static stability in this region accounts for about half of the polar surface warming. Cloud radiative effects act to enhance this local contribution. In contrast, remote nonpolar heating induces a robust polar warming pattern that features a midtropospheric peak, regardless of the meridional location of the forcing. Among all remote forcing experiments, the deep tropical forcing case contributes most to the polar-amplified surface warming pattern relative to the global mean, while the high-latitude forcing cases contribute most to enhancing the polar surface warming magnitude.},

abstract = {Rossby waves that propagate westward on decadal timescales. This results in a build-up of ocean heat content in the off-equatorial western Pacific. If an ENSO event subsequently switches the sign of the tropical Pacific SST anomaly, this off-equatorial heat is redistributed via Kelvin waves throughout the equatorial region , leading to a transition in the PDO. Meehl et al. (2016) investigate this mechanism in the context of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO; similar to the PDO but the spatial domain spans the full meridional extent of the Pacific), finding that initialized hindcasts with the Community Climate System Model, Version 4, (CCSM4; Gent et al., 2011) show skill in simulating past IPO transitions with this mechanism appearing to coincide with those particular transitions. Since the PDO is considered the North Pacific manifestation of the IPO, the mechanism outlined above is directly relevant to understanding and predicting PDO transitions (Farneti et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2021). While stochastic climate models and LIMs model the climate system as linear, it has been suggested that predictive skill, especially of oceanic variability, could be gained using methods that better capture non-linearities in the system (Newman, 2007). Artificial neural networks (ANNs), a form of unsupervised machine learning, offer such a non-linear framework and have proven skillful at predicting processes in the climate system such as identifying the forced response to climate change, ENSO evolution and Madden -Julian Oscillation teleconnections (Barnes et al., 2020; Ham et al., 2019; Mayer {\&} Barnes, 2021; Toms et al., 2020). Specifically in the case of oceanic predictability, Ham et al. (2019) used a convolutional neural network to predict ENSO evolution, showing significantly higher forecast skill than previous dynamical forecasts, while also identifying spatial SST patterns corresponding to increased predictability. Similarly, Nadiga (2021) demonstrated how reservoir computing (a form of recurrent neural networks) increases predictability of oceanic variability in the North Atlantic Ocean on the interannual timescale, especially during period of infrequent or missing data. Together, these studies suggest that neural networks are effective for Figure 1. (a) North Pacific PC 1 projected onto global de-seasoned SST.

To show the strengths of the proposed approach, we include experiments on tabular data, images, and text; all showing improved explanations.

the center of the ITCZ, and rainfall is strongly
depleted in delta(18)O. A 120-yr coral isotopic
record indicates an alternation of wet and dry
intervals lasting 15 to 20 yr. The most recent 2
decades are dominated by interannual variability,
which is tightly Coupled to the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO). This is unprecedented in the 120

atmospheric dynamics, this provides evidence of a
major change in the coupled ENSO-monsoon system. (C)

abstract = {Accurate representation of crop responses to climate is critically important to understand impacts of climate change and variability in food systems. We use Random Forest (RF), a diagnostic machine learning tool, to explore the dependence of yield on climate and technology for maize, sorghum and soybean in the US plains. We analyze the period from 1980 to 2016 and use a panel of county yields and climate variables for the crop-specific developmental phases: establishment, critical window (yield potential definition) and grain filling. The RF models accounted for between 71{\%} to 86{\%} of the yield variance. Technology, evaluated through the time variable, accounted for approximately 20{\%} of the yield variance and indicates that yields have steadily increased. Responses to climate confirm prior findings revealing threshold-like responses to high temperature (yield decrease sharply when maximum temperature exceed 29 C and 30 C for maize and soybean), and reveal a higher temperature tolerance for sorghum, whose yield decreases gradually as maximum temperature exceeds 32.5 C. We found that sorghum and soybean responded positively to increases in cool minimum temperatures. Maize yield exhibited a unique and negative response to low atmospheric humidity during the critical phase that encompasses flowering, as well as a strong sensitivity to extreme temperature exposure. Using maize as a benchmark, we estimate that if warming continues unabated through the first half of the 21st century, the best climatic conditions for rainfed maize and soybean production may shift from Iowa and Illinois to Minnesota and the Dakotas with possible modulation by soil productivity.},

abstract = {Rainfall variability over the Amazon basin has often
been linked to variations in Pacific sea surface
temperature (SST), and in particular, to the El
Nio/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, only a
fraction of Amazon rainfall variability can be
explained by ENSO. Building upon the recent work of
Zeng (Environ Res Lett 3:014002, 2008), here we
provide further evidence for an influence on Amazon
rainfall from the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The
strength of the North Atlantic influence is found to
be comparable to the better-known Pacific ENSO
connection. The tropical South Atlantic Ocean also
shows some influence during the wet-to-dry season
transition period. The Atlantic influence is through
changes in the north-south divergent circulation and
the movement of the ITCZ following warm
SST. Therefore, it is strongest in the southern part
of the Amazon basin during the Amazon's dry season
(July-October). In contrast, the ENSO related
teleconnection is through anomalous east-west Walker
circulation with largely concentrated in the eastern
(lower) Amazon. This ENSO connection is seasonally
locked to boreal winter. A complication due to the
influence of ENSO on Atlantic SST causes an apparent
North Atlantic SST lag of Amazon rainfall. Removing
ENSO from North Atlantic SST via linear regression
resolves this causality problem in that the residual
Atlantic variability correlates well and is in phase
with the Amazon rainfall. A strong Atlantic
influence during boreal summer and autumn is
particularly significant in terms of the impact on
the hydro-ecosystem which is most vulnerable during
the dry season, as highlighted by the severe 2005
Amazon drought. Such findings have implications for
both seasonal-interannual climate prediction and
understanding the longer-term changes of the Amazon
rainforest.},

abstract = {While the Arctic region has been warming strongly in recent decades, anomalously large snowfall in recent winters has affected large parts of North America, Europe, and east Asia. Here we demonstrate that the decrease in autumn Arctic sea ice area is linked to changes in the winter Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation that have some resemblance to the negative phase of the winter Arctic oscillation. However, the atmospheric circulation change linked to the reduction of sea ice shows much broader meridional meanders in midlatitudes and clearly different interannual variability than the classical Arctic oscillation. This circulation change results in more frequent episodes of blocking patterns that lead to increased cold surges over large parts of northern continents. Moreover, the increase in atmospheric water vapor content in the Arctic region during late autumn and winter driven locally by the reduction of sea ice provides enhanced moisture sources, supporting increased heavy snowfall in Europe during early winter and the northeastern and midwestern United States during winter. We conclude that the recent decline of Arctic sea ice has played a critical role in recent cold and snowy winters.},

Here, we apply the Winton-Held two-layer model and show that the probability of the observed 2000–2012 hiatus period to arise from internal variability driven by white noise is larger if climate sensitivity is low. This is due to the delayed response of the oceans that cause the forced trend to increase faster with rising climate sensitivity than does natural variability, leading to a decreasing likelihood of observing the hiatus.

@article{Medhaug2017a,
abstract = {Between about 1998 and 2012, a time that coincided with political negotiations for preventing climate change, the surface of Earth seemed hardly to warm. This phenomenon, often termed the ‘global warming hiatus', caused doubt in the public mind about how well anthropogenic climate change and natural variability are understood. Here we show that apparently contradictory conclusions stem from different definitions of ‘hiatus' and from different datasets. A combination of changes in forcing, uptake of heat by the oceans, natural variability and incomplete observational coverage reconciles models and data. Combined with stronger recent warming trends in newer datasets, we are now more confident than ever that human influence is dominant in long-term warming. Apparently contradictory conclusions regarding the ‘global warming hiatus' are reconciled, strengthening the current scientific understanding that long-term global warming is extremely likely to be of anthropogenic origin. After a spike in global-mean temperature associated with the 1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o, the climate system experienced several years of reduced warming, and perhaps even slight cooling. This period, variously termed the 'hiatus', 'pause' or 'slowdown', should have come as no surprise given our understanding of El Ni{\~{n}}o and natural climate variability. However, soon after the recognition of the reduced warming, it appeared that models and observations were diverging, raising the question of whether the models were missing important processes. Although global warming has since recommenced, the hiatus sparked an enormous research effort. Iselin Medhaug et al. synthesize the literature and reassess the model and observational evidence. Their assessment reconciles the apparent contradictions between models and data and obviates the need to revise our understanding of the underlying physics of climate systems. The hiatus was an episode of natural variability after all.},

abstract = {Large changes in the hydrology of the western United
States have been observed since the mid-twentieth
century. These include a reduction in the amount of
precipitation arriving as snow, a decline in
snowpack at low and midelevations, and a shift
toward earlier arrival of both snowmelt and the
centroid (center of mass) of streamflows. To project
future water supply reliability, it is crucial to
obtain a better understanding of the underlying
cause or causes for these changes. A regional
warming is often posited as the cause of these
changes without formal testing of different
competitive explanations for the warming. In this
study, a rigorous detection and attribution analysis
is performed to determine the causes of the late
winter/early spring changes in hydrologically
relevant temperature variables over mountain ranges
of the western United States. Natural internal
climate variability, as estimated from two long
control climate model simulations, is insufficient
to explain the rapid increase in daily minimum and
maximum temperatures, the sharp decline in frost
days, and the rise in degree-days above 0 degrees C
(a simple proxy for temperature-driven
snowmelt). These observed changes are also
inconsistent with the model-predicted responses to
variability in solar irradiance and volcanic
activity. The observations are consistent with
climate simulations that include the combined
effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and
aerosols. It is found that, for each temperature
variable considered, an anthropogenic signal is
identifiable in observational fields. The results
are robust to uncertainties in model-estimated
fingerprints and natural variability noise, to the
choice of statistical down-scaling method, and to
various processing options in the detection and
attribution method.},

For example, East Asia has experienced several major cold events while the underlying temperature over the Arctic has risen steadily. To understand the influence of sea ice in the Barents Sea on atmospheric circulation during winter from a synoptic perspective, this study evaluated the downstream response in cyclone activities with respect to the underlying sea ice variability. The composite analysis, including all cyclone events over the Nordic seas, revealed that an anticyclonic anomaly prevailed along the Siberian coast during light ice years over the Barents Sea. This likely caused anomalous warm advection over the Barents Sea and cold advection over eastern Siberia. The difference in cyclone paths between heavy and light ice years was expressed as a warm-Arctic cold-Siberian (WACS) anomaly. The lower baroclinicity over the Barents Sea during the light ice years, which resulted from a weak gradient in sea surface temperature, prevented cyclones from traveling eastward. This could lead to fewer cyclones and hence to an anticyclonic anomaly over the Siberian coast. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

As a result, scientific interest is rapidly shifting from detection and attribution of global climate change to prediction of its impacts at the regional scale. However, nearly everything we have any confidence in when it comes to climate change is related to global patterns of surface temperature, which are primarily controlled by thermodynamics. In contrast, we have much less confidence in atmospheric circulation aspects of climate change, which are primarily controlled by dynamics and exert a strong control on regional climate. Model projections of circulation-related fields, including precipitation, show a wide range of possible outcomes, even on centennial timescales. Sources of uncertainty include low-frequency chaotic variability and the sensitivity to model error of the circulation response to climate forcing. As the circulation response to external forcing appears to project strongly onto existing patterns of variability, knowledge of errors in the dynamics of variability may provide some constraints on model projections. Nevertheless, higher scientific confidence in circulation-related aspects of climate change will be difficult to obtain. For effective decision-making, it is necessary to move to a more explicitly probabilistic, risk-based approach.},

Current estimates of CH3Br and CH3Cl emissions from oceanic sources, terrestrial plants and fungi, biomass burning and anthropogenic inputs do not balance their losses owing to oxidation by hydroxyl radicals, oceanic degradation, and consumption in soils, suggesting that additional natural terrestrial sources may be important. Here we show that CH3Br and CH3Cl are released to the atmosphere from all vegetation zones of two coastal salt marshes. We see very large fluxes of CH3Br and CH3Cl per unit area: up to 42 and 570 micromol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The fluxes show large diurnal, seasonal and spatial variabilities, but there is a strong correlation between the fluxes of CH3Br and those of CH3Cl, with an average molar flux ratio of roughly 1:20. If our measurements are typical of salt marshes globally, they suggest that such ecosystems, even though they constitute less than 0.1{\%} of the global surface area, may produce roughly 10{\%} of the total fluxes of atmospheric CH3Br and CH3Cl.},

abstract = {Global climate models are central tools for understanding past and future climate change. The assessment of model skill, in turn, can benefit from modern data science approaches. Here we apply causal discovery algorithms to sea level pressure data from a large set of climate model simulations and, as a proxy for observations, meteorological reanalyses. We demonstrate how the resulting causal networks (fingerprints) offer an objective pathway for process-oriented model evaluation. Models with fingerprints closer to observations better reproduce important precipitation patterns over highly populated areas such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, East Asia, Europe and North America. We further identify expected model interdependencies due to shared development backgrounds. Finally, our network metrics provide stronger relationships for constraining precipitation projections under climate change as compared to traditional evaluation metrics for storm tracks or precipitation itself. Such emergent relationships highlight the potential of causal networks to constrain longstanding uncertainties in climate change projections.},

@article{Hahn2022,
abstract = {Arctic surface warming under greenhouse gas forcing peaks in winter and reaches its minimum during summer in both observations and model projections. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this seasonal asymmetry, but disentangling these processes remains a challenge in the interpretation of general circulation model (GCM) experiments. To isolate these mechanisms, we use an idealized single-column sea ice model (SCM) that captures the seasonal pattern of Arctic warming. SCM experiments demonstrate that as sea ice melts and exposes open ocean, the accompanying increase in effective surface heat capacity alone can produce the observed pattern of peak warming in early winter (shifting to late winter under increased forcing) by slowing the seasonal heating rate, thus delaying the phase and reducing the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of surface temperature. To investigate warming seasonality in more complex models, we perform GCM experiments that individually isolate sea ice albedo and thermodynamic effects under CO2 forcing. These also show a key role for the effective heat capacity of sea ice in promoting seasonal asymmetry through suppressing summer warming, in addition to precluding summer climatological inversions and a positive summer lapse-rate feedback. Peak winter warming in GCM experiments is further supported by a positive winter lapse-rate feedback, due to cold initial surface temperatures and strong surface-trapped warming that are enabled by the albedo effects of sea ice alone. While many factors contribute to the seasonal pattern of Arctic warming, these results highlight changes in effective surface heat capacity as a central mechanism supporting this seasonality. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Under increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the strongest Arctic warming has occurred during early winter, but the reasons for this seasonal pattern of warming are not well understood. We use experiments in both simple and complex models with certain sea ice processes turned on and off to disentangle potential drivers of seasonality in Arctic warming. When sea ice melts and open ocean is exposed, surface temperatures are slower to reach the warm-season maximum and slower to cool back down below freezing in early winter. We find that this process alone can produce the observed pattern of maximum Arctic warming in early winter, highlighting a fundamental mechanism for the seasonality of Arctic warming.},

@article{stenchikov02,
abstract = {[1] Observations show that strong equatorial
volcanic eruptions have been followed by a
pronounced positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation
(AO) for one or two Northern Hemisphere winters. It
has been previously assumed that this effect is
forced by strengthening of the equator-to-pole
temperature gradient in the lower stratosphere,
caused by aerosol radiative heating in the
tropics. To understand atmospheric processes that
cause the AO response, we studied the impact of the
1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, which produced the
largest global volcanic aerosol cloud in the
twentieth century. A series of control and
perturbation experiments were conducted with the
GFDL SKYHI general circulation model to examine the
evolution of the circulation in the 2 years
following the Pinatubo eruption. In one set of
perturbation experiments, the full radiative effects
of the observed Pinatubo aerosol cloud were
included, while in another only the effects of the
aerosols in reducing the solar flux in the
troposphere were included, and the aerosol heating
effects in the stratosphere were suppressed. A third
set of perturbation experiments imposed the
stratospheric ozone losses observed in the
post-Pinatubo period. We conducted ensembles of four
to eight realizations for each case. Forced by
aerosols, SKYHI produces a statistically significant
positive phase of the AO in winter, as
observed. Ozone depletion causes a positive phase of
the AO in late winter and early spring by cooling
the lower stratosphere in high latitudes,
strengthening the polar night jet, and delaying the
final warming. A positive phase of the AO was also
produced in the experiment with only the
tropospheric effect of aerosols, showing that
aerosol heating in the lower tropical stratosphere
is not necessary to force positive AO response, as
was previously assumed. Aerosol-induced tropospheric
cooling in the subtropics decreases the meridional
temperature gradient in the winter troposphere
between 30degreesN and 60degreesN. The corresponding
reduction of mean zonal energy and amplitudes of
planetary waves in the troposphere decreases wave
activity flux into the lower stratosphere. The
resulting strengthening of the polar vortex forces a
positive phase of the AO. We suggest that this
mechanism can also contribute to the observed
long-term AO trend being caused by greenhouse gas
increases because they also weaken the tropospheric
meridional temperature gradient due to polar
amplification of warming.},

To begin to address this problem, we examined the effects of hurricane track and intensity information in a laboratory setting where participants judged the probability that hypothetical hurricanes with a constant bearing (i.e., straight line forecast track) would make landfall in each of eight 45 degree sectors around the Gulf of Mexico. The results from 162 participants in a student sample showed that the judged strike probability distributions over the eight sectors within each scenario were, unsurprisingly, unimodal and centered on the sector toward which the forecast track pointed. More significantly, although strike probability judgments for the sector in the direction of the forecast track were generally higher than the corresponding judgments for the other sectors, the latter were not zero. Most significantly, there were no appreciable differences in the patterns of strike probability judgments for hurricane tracks represented by a forecast track only, an uncertainty cone only, or forecast track with an uncertainty cone-a result consistent with a recent survey of coastal residents threatened by Hurricane Charley. The study results suggest that people are able to correctly process basic information about hurricane tracks but they do make some errors. More research is needed to understand the sources of these errors and to identify better methods of displaying uncertainty about hurricane parameters. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Risk Analysis.},

strong tendency for PDO impacts in the Southern

evidence for just two full PDO cycles in the past

dominated from 1925-1946 and from 1977 through (at

Pacific climate have widespread impacts on natural
systems, including water resources in the Americas

The ice cover is also thinning. Downward trends in extent and thickness have been accompanied by pronounced interannual and multiyear variability, forced by both the atmosphere and ocean. As the ice thins, its response to atmospheric and oceanic forcing may be changing. In support of a busier Arctic, there is a growing need to predict ice conditions on a variety of time and space scales. A major challenge to providing seasonal scale predictions is the 7–10 days limit of numerical weather prediction. While a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean is likely well within this century, there is much uncertainty in the timing. This reflects differences in climate model structure, the unknown evolution of anthropogenic forcing, and natural climate variability. In sharp contrast to the Arctic, Antarctic sea ice extent, while highly variable, has increased slightly over the period of satellite observations. The reasons for this different behavior remain to be resolved, but responses to changing atmospheric circulation patterns appear to play a strong role.},

The impacts of these changes, which include dramatic ice loss from ice sheets and rapid declines in Arctic sea ice, could be quite large in terms of sea level rise and global climate. NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), currently planned for launch in 2015, is specifically intended to quantify the amount of change in ice sheets and sea ice and provide key insights into their behavior. It will achieve these objectives through the use of precise laser measurements of surface elevation, building on the groundbreaking capabilities of its predecessor, the Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). In particular, ICESat-2 will measure the temporal and spatial character of ice sheet elevation change to enable assessment of ice sheet mass balance and examination of the underlying mechanisms that control it. The precision of ICESat-2's elevation measurement will also allow for accurate measurements of sea ice freeboard height, from which sea ice thickness and its temporal changes can be estimated. ICESat-2 will provide important information on other components of the Earth System as well, most notably large-scale vegetation biomass estimates through the measurement of vegetation canopy height. When combined with the original ICESat observations, ICESat-2 will provide ice change measurements across more than a 15-year time span. Its significantly improved laser system will also provide observations with much greater spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and accuracy than has ever been possible before.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Previous modelling and observational studies have shown discrepancies in the interannual relationship of winter surface air temperature (SAT) between Arctic and East Asia, stimulating the debate about whether Arctic change can influence midlatitude climate. This study uses two sets of coordinated experiments (EXP1 and EXP2) from six different atmospheric general circulation models. Both EXP1 and EXP2 consist of 130 ensemble members, each of which in EXP1 (EXP2) was forced by the same observed daily varying sea ice and daily varying (daily climatological) sea surface temperature (SST) for 1982–2014 but with different atmospheric initial conditions. Large spread exists among ensemble members in simulating the Arctic–East Asian SAT relationship. Only a fraction of ensemble members can reproduce the observed deep Arctic warming–cold continent pattern which extends from surface to upper troposphere, implying the important role of atmospheric internal variability. The mechanisms of deep Arctic warming and shallow Arctic warming are further distinguished. Arctic warming aloft is caused primarily by poleward moisture transport, which in conjunction with the surface warming coupled with sea ice melting constitutes the surface-amplified deep Arctic warming throughout the troposphere. These processes associated with the deep Arctic warming may be related to the forcing of remote SST when there is favorable atmospheric circulation such as Rossby wave train propagating from the North Atlantic into the Arctic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {It is shown that some important aspects of the
space-time structure of multidecadal sea surface
temperature (SST) variability can be explained by
local air-sea interactions. A concept for "Global
Hyper Climate Modes'' is formulated: surface heat
flux variability associated with regional
atmospheric variability patterns is integrated by
the large heat capacity of the extra-tropical
oceans, leading to a continuous increase of SST
variance towards longer timescales. Atmospheric
teleconnections spread the extratropical signal to
the tropical regions. Once SST anomalies have
developed in the Tropics, global atmospheric
teleconnections spread the signal around the world
creating a global hyper climate mode. A simple model
suggests that hyper climate modes can vary on
timescales longer than 1,000 years. Ocean dynamics
may amplify theses modes and influence the regional
expression of the variability, but are not at the
heart of the mechanism which produces the hyper
modes.},

abstract = {Deep learning methods are achieving ever-increasing performance on many artificial intelligence tasks. A major limitation of deep models is that they are not amenable to interpretability. This limitation can be circumvented by developing post hoc techniques to explain the predictions, giving rise to the area of explainability. Recently, explainability of deep models on images and texts has achieved significant progress. In the area of graph data, graph neural networks (GNNs) and their explainability are experiencing rapid developments. However, there is neither a unified treatment of GNN explainability methods, nor a standard benchmark and testbed for evaluations. In this survey, we provide a unified and taxonomic view of current GNN explainability methods. Our unified and taxonomic treatments of this subject shed lights on the commonalities and differences of existing methods and set the stage for further methodological developments. To facilitate evaluations, we generate a set of benchmark graph datasets specifically for GNN explainability. We summarize current datasets and metrics for evaluating GNN explainability. Altogether, this work provides a unified methodological treatment of GNN explainability and a standardized testbed for evaluations.},

Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors - agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor - increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2{\%} of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20{\%} of county income (90{\%} chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).},

abstract = {Evaluating historical simulations from global climate models (GCMs) remains an important exercise for better understanding future projections of climate change and variability in rapidly warming regions, such as the Arctic. As an alternative approach for comparing climate models and observations, we set up a machine learning classification task using a shallow artificial neural network (ANN). Specifically, we train an ANN on maps of annual mean near-surface temperature in the Arctic from a multi-model large ensemble archive in order to classify which GCM produced each temperature map. After training our ANN on data from the large ensembles, we input annual mean maps of Arctic temperature from observational reanalysis and sort the prediction output according to increasing values of the ANN's confidence for each GCM class. To attempt to understand how the ANN is classifying each temperature map with a GCM, we leverage a feature attribution method from explainable artificial intelligence. By comparing composites from the attribution method for every GCM classification, we find that the ANN is learning regional temperature patterns in the Arctic that are unique to each GCM relative to the multi-model mean ensemble. In agreement with recent studies, we show that ANNs can be useful tools for extracting regional climate signals in GCMs and observations.},

abstract = {We present an experimental reconstruction of River
Murray streamflow to assess present-day variations
in the context of the past two centuries. Nine
annually resolved paleoclimate proxy records from
the Australasian region are used to develop a
reconstruction of streamflow from 1783 to 1988. An
ensemble of reconstructions is presented, providing
probabilistic estimates of River Murray flows for
each year back in time. The best-estimate
reconstruction captures approximately 23{\%} (50{\%}) of
annual (decadal) naturalized streamflow
variability. High and low streamflow phases and
their association with decadal climate variability
in the Pacific are discussed. Reconstructed River
Murray streamflow shows considerable variation since
1783. We estimate that there is a 2.3{\%} chance that
the 1998-2008 record low decadal streamflow deficit
has been exceeded since European
settlement. Stochastic simulations of the decadal
variations in River Murray streamflow are computed
using the paleostreamflow reconstruction to estimate
model parameters. From these simulations, we
estimate that the 1998-2008 streamflow deficit has
an approximate 1 in 1500 year return period. As
climate models are assessed relative to short
instrumental records, future projections of
decadal-scale variations in Murray-Darling Basin
(MDB) streamflow may be inadequately
represented. Given the immense socioeconomic
importance of Australia's "food bowl," future
paleoclimate and modeling efforts should be directed
at understanding variability at this scale. This
would greatly enhance our capacity to estimate
regional sensitivity of the MDB's hydroclimate to
further anthropogenic influences.},

abstract = {The El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drives substantial variability in rainfall, severe weather, agricultural production, ecosystems and disease in many parts of the world. Given that further human-forced changes in the Earth's climate system seem inevitable, the possibility exists that the character of ENSO and its impacts might change over the coming century. Although this issue has been investigated many times during the past 20 years, there is very little consensus on future changes in ENSO, apart from an expectation that ENSO will continue to be a dominant source of year-to-year variability. Here we show that there are in fact robust projected changes in the spatial patterns of year-to-year ENSO-driven variability in both surface temperature and precipitation. These changes are evident in the two most recent generations of climate models, using four different scenarios for CO2 and other radiatively active gases. By the mid- to late twenty-first century, the projections include an intensification of both El-Ni{\~{n}}o-driven drying in the western Pacific Ocean and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. Experiments with an Atmospheric General Circulation Model reveal that robust projected changes in precipitation anomalies during El Ni{\~{n}}o years are primarily determined by a nonlinear response to surface global warming. Uncertain projected changes in the amplitude of ENSO-driven surface temperature variability have only a secondary role. Projected changes in key characteristics of ENSO are consequently much clearer than previously realized.},

abstract = {This research appraises how residential built environment growth influences coastal exposure and how this component of societal vulnerability contributes to tropical cyclone impact and disaster potential. Historical housing unit data and future demographic projections from a high-resolution, spatial allocation model illustrate that the area within 50 km of the US Atlantic and Gulf Coastlines has the greatest housing unit density of any physiographic region in the USA, with residential development in this region outpacing non-coastal areas. Tropical cyclone exposure for six at-risk metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) along the US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts are assessed. All six MSAs evaluated are distinct in their development character, yet all experienced significant growth from 1940 through the contemporary period; projections from the model under various socioeconomic pathways reveal that this growth is anticipated to continue during the twenty-first century. Using a worst-case scenario framework, the historical and future residential data for the six MSAs are intersected with synthetic hurricane wind swaths generated from contemporary landfalling events. The New York City MSA contains the greatest residential built environment exposure, but Miami is the most rapidly changing MSA and has the greatest potential for hurricane disaster occurrence based on the juxtaposition of climatological risk and exposure. A disaster potential metric illustrates that all six MSAs will experience significant increases in disaster probability during the twenty-first century. This analysis facilitates a detailed spatiotemporal assessment of US coastal region vulnerability, providing decision makers with information that may be used to evaluate the potential for tropical cyclone disasters, mitigate tropical cyclone hazard impacts, and build community resilience for these and other hazards in the face of environmental and societal change.},

abstract = {Explainable AI (XAI) aims to provide interpretations for predictions made by learning machines, such as deep neural networks, in order to make the machines more transparent for the user and furthermore trustworthy also for applications in e.g. safety-critical areas. So far, however, no methods for quantifying uncertainties of explanations have been conceived, which is problematic in domains where a high confidence in explanations is a prerequisite. We therefore contribute by proposing a new framework that allows to convert any arbitrary explanation method for neural networks into an explanation method for Bayesian neural networks, with an in-built modeling of uncertainties. Within the Bayesian framework a network's weights follow a distribution that extends standard single explanation scores and heatmaps to distributions thereof, in this manner translating the intrinsic network model uncertainties into a quantification of explanation uncertainties. This allows us for the first time to carve out uncertainties associated with a model explanation and subsequently gauge the appropriate level of explanation confidence for a user (using percentiles). We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach extensively in various experiments, both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

@article{benson02,
abstract = {Continuous, high-resolution delta(18)O records from
cored sediments of Pyramid Lake, Nevada, indicate
that oscillations in the hydrologic balance
occurred, on average, about every 150 years (yr)
during the past 7630 calendar years (cal yr). The
records are not stationary; during the past 2740 yr,
drought durations ranged from 20 to 100 yr and
intervals between droughts ranged from 80 to 230
yr. Comparison of tree-ring-based reconstructions of
climate change for the past 1200 yr from the Sierra
Nevada and the El Malpais region of northwest New
Mexico indicates that severe droughts associated
with Anasazi withdrawal from Chaco Canyon at 820 cal
yr BP (calendar years before present) and final
abandonment of Chaco Canyon, Mesa Verde, and the
Kayenta area at 650 cal yr BP may have impacted much
of the western United States. During the middle
Holocene (informally defined in this paper as
extending from 8000 to 3000 cal yr BP), magnetic
susceptibility values of sediments deposited in
Pyramid Lake's deep basin were much larger than
late-Holocene (3000-0 cal yr BP) values, indicating
the presence of a shallow take. In addition, the
mean delta(18)O value of CaCO3 precipitated between
6500 and 3430 cal yr BP was 1.6parts per thousand
less than the mean value of CaCO3 precipitated after
2740 cal yr BP. Numerical calculations indicate that
the shift in the delta(18)O baseline probably
resulted from a transition to a wetter ({\textgreater} 30{\%}) and
cooler (3-5degreesC) climate. The existence of a
relatively dry and warm middle-Holocene climate in
the Truckee River-Pyramid Lake system is generally
consistent with archeological, sedimentological,
chemical, physical, and biological records from
various sites within the Great Basin of the western
United States. Two high-resolution Holocene-climate
records are now available from the Pyramid and Owens
lake basins which suggest that the Holocene was
characterized by five climatic intervals. TIC and
6180 records from Owens Lake indicate that the first
interval in the early Holocene (11,600 10,000 cal yr
BP) was characterized by a drying trend that was
interrupted by a brief (200 yr) wet oscillation
centered at 10,300 cal yr BP. This was followed by a
second early-Holocene interval (10,000-8000 cal yr
BP) during which relatively wet conditions
prevailed. During the early part of the middle
Holocene (8000-6500 cal yr BP), high-amplitude
oscillations in TIC in Owens Lake and delta(18)O in
Pyramid Lake indicate the presence of shallow lakes
in bomb basins. During the latter part of the middle
Holocene (6500 3800 cal yr BP), drought conditions
dominated, Owens Lake desiccated, and Lake Tahoe
ceased spilling to the Truckee River, causing
Pyramid Lake to decline. At the beginning of the
late Holocene (similar to 3000 cal yr BP), Lake
Tahoe rose to its sill level and Pyramid Lake
increased in volume. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

@article{hansen05_efficacy,
abstract = {[1] We use a global climate model to compare the
effectiveness of many climate forcing agents for
producing climate change. We find a substantial
range in the "efficacy'' of different forcings,
where the efficacy is the global temperature
response per unit forcing relative to the response
to CO2 forcing. Anthropogenic CH4 has efficacy
similar to 110{\%}, which increases to similar to
145{\%} when its indirect effects on stratospheric H2O
and tropospheric O-3 are included, yielding an
effective climate forcing of similar to 0.8 W/m(2)
for the period 1750 - 2000 and making CH4 the
largest anthropogenic climate forcing other than
CO2. Black carbon (BC) aerosols from biomass burning
have a calculated efficacy similar to 58{\%}, while
fossil fuel BC has an efficacy similar to
78{\%}. Accounting for forcing efficacies and for
indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes,
we find that fossil fuel soot, defined as BC + OC (
organic carbon), has a net positive forcing while
biomass burning BC + OC has a negative forcing. We
show that replacement of the traditional
instantaneous and adjusted forcings, Fi and Fa, with
an easily computed alternative, Fs, yields a better
predictor of climate change, i.e., its efficacies
are closer to unity. Fs is inferred from flux and
temperature changes in a fixed-ocean model
run. There is remarkable congruence in the spatial
distribution of climate change, normalized to the
same forcing Fs, for most climate forcing agents,
suggesting that the global forcing has more
relevance to regional climate change than may have
been anticipated. Increasing greenhouse gases
intensify the Hadley circulation in our model,
increasing rainfall in the Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ITCZ), Eastern United States, and East Asia,
while intensifying dry conditions in the subtropics
including the Southwest United States, the
Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and an
expanding Sahel. These features survive in model
simulations that use all estimated forcings for the
period 1880 - 2000. Responses to localized forcings,
such as land use change and heavy regional
concentrations of BC aerosols, include more specific
regional characteristics. We suggest that
anthropogenic tropospheric O-3 and the BC snow
albedo effect contribute substantially to rapid
warming and sea ice loss in the Arctic. As a
complement to a priori forcings, such as Fi, Fa, and
Fs, we tabulate the a posteriori effective forcing,
Fe, which is the product of the forcing and its
efficacy. Fe requires calculation of the climate
response and introduces greater model dependence,
but once it is calculated for a given amount of a
forcing agent it provides a good prediction of the
response to other forcing amounts.},

@article{emile-geay08,
abstract = {The controversial claim that El Ni (n) over tildeo
events might be partially caused by radiative
forcing due to volcanic aerosols is
reassessed. Building on the work of Mann et al.,
estimates of volcanic forcing over the past
millennium and a climate model of intermediate
complexity are used to draw a diagram of El Ni (n)
over tildeo likelihood as a function of the
intensity of volcanic forcing. It is shown that in
the context of this model, only eruptions larger
than that of Mt. Pinatubo ( 1991, peak dimming of
about 3.7Wm(-2)) can shift the likelihood and
amplitude of an El Ni (n) over tildeo event above
the level of the model's internal
variability. Explosive volcanism cannot be said to
trigger El Ni (n) over tildeo events per se, but it
is found to raise their likelihood by 50{\%} on
average, also favoring higher amplitudes. This
reconciles, on one hand, the demonstration by Adams
et al. of a statistical relationship between
explosive volcanism and El Ni (n) over tildeo and,
on the other hand, the ability to predict El Ni (n)
over tildeo events of the last 148 yr without
knowledge of volcanic forcing. The authors then
focus on the strongest eruption of the millennium
(A. D. 1258), and show that it is likely to have
favored the occurrence of a moderate-to-strong El Ni
(n) over tildeo event in the midst of prevailing La
Ni (n) over tildea-like conditions induced by
increased solar activity during the well-documented
Medieval Climate Anomaly. Compiling paleoclimate
data from a wide array of sources, a number of
important hydroclimatic consequences for neighboring
areas is documented. The authors propose, in
particular, that the event briefly interrupted a
solar-induced megadrought in the southwestern United
States. Most of the time, however, volcanic
eruptions are found to be too small to significantly
affect ENSO statistics.},

Interglacial times with SSTs equal to or exceeding that of the Holocene contain peak abundances in the pollen of redwood, the distinctive component of the temperate rainforest of the northwest coast of California. In the region now dominated by the California Current, SSTs warmed 10,000 to 15,000 years in advance of deglaciation at each of the past five glacial maxima. SSTs did not rise in advance of deglaciation south of the modern California Current front. Glacial warming along the California margin therefore is a regional signal of the weakening of the California Current during times when large ice sheets reorganized wind systems over the North Pacific. Both the timing and magnitude of the SST estimates suggest that the Devils Hole (Nevada) calcite record represents regional but not global paleotemperatures, and hence does not pose a fundamental challenge to the orbital ("Milankovitch") theory of the Ice Ages.},

abstract = {Record low austral winter rainfall totals over
southwest Western Australia (SWWA) in 2010 saw a
continuation of the multidecade-long winter drought
plaguing the region. During this season, the highest
recorded positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM) value
was measured, adding weight to an association of a
positive SAM with anomalously low SWWA winter
rainfall (SWR), and vice-versa. However, such a
SAM-SWR teleconnection has been recently
questioned. Using observational data in the
post-1979 satellite era, it is shown that such a SAM
influence does exist. This coherence is confirmed
with 1150 years of modelled 20th century SWR
anomalies and SAM values from 23 climate models,
showing that a nonlinear impact operates: the
influence from a negative SAM is greater than that
from a positive SAM. This explains why a small
positive shift in the SAM can cause a large SWR
reduction, as has been observed. A further test
shows that models with a greater positive SAM trend
systematically produce a greater future SWR
reduction. As all climate models project an increase
in the SAM these results suggest that as global
warming continues unabated, SWWA winter droughts
will be more persistent as atmospheric conditions
become more unfavourable for drought-breaking
rains. Citation: Cai, W., P. van Rensch, S. Borlace,

@article{oglesby12,
abstract = {During medieval times (900-1300 AD; henceforth MT),
persistent drought ('megadrought') was a ubiquitous
feature for much of North America. To better
understand the mechanisms for these droughts,
relationships between specific sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) and drought in North America
have been synthesized from previous studies using
modern observations, proxy paleo-data, and
simulations from multiple climate models. Particular
focus is on the role of the Atlantic Multidecadal
Oscillation (AMO), a roughly 60-80 year fluctuation
in the North Atlantic between relatively warm ('warm
phase') and cool ('cold phase') SSTs. Present-day
relationships, for which instrumental observations
can be used, indicate that persistent droughts in
the U.S. Great Plains and Southwest are closely
related to AMO. During AMO warm (cold) phases, most
of North America is dry (wet). The MT drought is
closely related to AMO-like warm phases in the North
Atlantic. However, the MT drought is just one of
numerous droughts on centennial timescales affected
by the AMO that new results from the proxy record
indicate impacted North America during the
Holocene. The influence of North Atlantic SST on
modern North American drought is examined using
simulations made by global climate models. When
forced by warm North Atlantic SST anomalies, all
models captured significant drying over North
America, despite some regional differences. Overall,
the ensemble of the 5 models could well reproduce
the statistical relationship between the dry/wet
fluctuations in the North America and North Atlantic
SST anomalies. Using one particular climate model,
we further demonstrated that warm North Atlantic SST
anomalies might have played a major role in the MT
drought over much of North America. The MT drought
could be simulated either by perpetual La Nina-like
conditions in the eastern Pacific or warm phase of
the AMO in the North Atlantic. Best match to proxy
reconstructions was obtained, however, when both La
Nina and warm phase AMO conditions were
imposed. During the warm phase of AMO, the
subtropical high is displaced north and east of its
mean location, reducing moisture transport into the
US except along the mid-Atlantic coast. During the
cool phase, the subtropical high strengthens and
pushes westward, allowing for more moisture
transport into the central and western US. In
summary, the AMO modulates the large-scale
circulation to be more (less) conducive to
precipitation over the central and western
U.S. during cold (warm) phases. Its effects must be
considered along with other, shorter time-scale
factors such as ENSO, or PDO, as well as local
effects that affect land surface-atmosphere
interactions, such as soil moisture. (C) 2011

This warming is linked to anomalous solar heating of surface waters in the northern Chukchi Sea, a main entryway for halocline waters to join the interior Beaufort Gyre. Summer solar heat absorption by the surface waters has increased fivefold over the same time period, chiefly because of reduced sea ice coverage. It is shown that the solar heating, considered together with subduction rates of surface water in this region, is sufficient to account for the observed halocline warming. Heat absorption at the basin margins and its subsequent accumulation in the ocean interior, therefore, have consequences for Beaufort Gyre sea ice beyond the summer season.},

In general, all SST products show consistent spatial patterns and temporal variability during the overlapping time period (2003-18). The main differences between each product are located in the western boundary current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current regions. Linear trends display consistent SST spatial patterns among all products and exhibit a strong warming trend from 2012 to 2018 with the Pacific Ocean basin as the main contributor. The SST discrepancy between all SST products is very small compared to the significant warming trend. Spatial power spectral density shows that the interpolation into 18 spatial resolution has negligible impacts on our results. The global mean SST time series reveals larger differences among all SST products during the early period of the satellite era (1982-2002) when there were fewer observations, indicating that the observation frequency is the main constraint of the SST climatology. The maturity matrix scores, which present the maturity of each product in terms of documentation, storage, and dissemination but not the scientific quality, demonstrate that ESACCI and OSTIA SST are well documented for users' convenience. Improvements could be made for MGDSST and BoM SST. Finally, we have recommended that these SST products can be used for fundamental climate applications and climate studies (e.g., El Ni{\~{n}}o).},

abstract = {The Earth's climate is changing rapidly as a result of anthropogenic carbon emissions, and damaging impacts are expected to increase with warming. To prevent these and limit long-term global surface warming to, for example, 2 °C, a level of stabilization or of peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations needs to be set. Climate sensitivity, the global equilibrium surface warming after a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration, can help with the translation of atmospheric CO2 levels to warming. Various observations favour a climate sensitivity value of about 3 °C, with a likely range of about 2–4.5 °C. However, the physics of the response and uncertainties in forcing lead to fundamental difficulties in ruling out higher values. The quest to determine climate sensitivity has now been going on for decades, with disturbingly little progress in narrowing the large uncertainty range. However, in the process, fascinating new insights into the climate system and into policy aspects regarding mitigation have been gained. The well-constrained lower limit of climate sensitivity and the transient rate of warming already provide useful information for policy makers. But the upper limit of climate sensitivity will be more difficult to quantify.},

In addition to a substantial warming over much of the North Atlantic, caused by increasing greenhouse gases over the 21st century, climate projections show a surprising region of considerable future cooling at midlatitudes, referred to as the North Atlantic warming hole. A similar pattern of surface temperature trends has been observed in recent decades, but it remains unclear whether this pattern is of anthropogenic origin or a simple manifestation of internal climate variability. Here, analyzing state-of-the-art climate models and observations, we show that the recent North Atlantic warming hole is of anthropogenic origin. Our analysis reveals that the anthropogenic signal has only recently emerged from the internal climate variability, and can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions. We further show that a declining northward oceanic heat flux in recent decades, which is linked to this surface temperature pattern, is also of anthropogenic origin.},

forest-steppe ecotone on the east side of the Andes
is revealed in pollen and charcoal records obtained
from mid-latitude lakes. Prior to 15,000 cat yr BP,
the vegetation was characterized by steppe
vegetation with isolated stands of Nothofagus. The
climate was generally dry, and the sparse vegetation
apparently lacked sufficient fuels to bum
extensively. After 15,000 cat yr BP, a mixture of
Nothofagus forest and shrubland/steppe
developed. Fire activity increased between 13,250
and 11,400 cat yr BP, contemporaneous with a
regionally defined cold dry period (Huelmo/Maseardi
Cold Reversal). The early-Holocene period was
characterized by an open Nothofagus forest/shrubland
mosaic, and fire frequency was high in dry sites and
low in wet sites; the data suggest a sharp decrease
in moisture eastward from the Andes. A shift to a
surface-fire regime occurred at 7500 cat yr BP at
the wet site and at 4400 cat yr BP at the dry site,
preceding the expansion of Austrocedrus by 1000-1500
yr. The spread of Austrocedrus is explained by a
shift towards a cooler and wetter climate in the
middle and late Holocene. The change to a
surface-fire regime is consistent with increased
interannual climate variability and the onset or
strengthening of ENSO. The present-day mixed forest
dominated by Nothofagus and Austrocedrus was
established in the last few millennia. (c) 2006

abstract = {The objective of this research is to develop techniques for assimilating GOES-R series observations in precipitating scenes for the purpose of improving short-term convective-scale forecasts of high-impact weather hazards. Whereas one approach is radiance assimilation, the information content of GOES-R radiances from its Advanced Baseline Imager saturates in precipitating scenes, and radiance assimilation does not make use of lightning observations from the GOES Lightning Mapper. Here, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is developed to transform GOES-R radiances and lightning into synthetic radar reflectivity fields to make use of existing radar assimilation techniques. We find that the ability of CNNs to utilize spatial context is essential for this application and offers breakthrough improvement in skill compared to traditional pixel-by-pixel based approaches. To understand the improved performance, we use a novel analysis method that combines several techniques, each providing different insights into the network's reasoning. Channel-withholding experiments and spatial information–withholding experiments are used to show that the CNN achieves skill at high reflectivity values from the information content in radiance gradients and the presence of lightning. The attribution method, layerwise relevance propagation, demonstrates that the CNN uses radiance and lightning information synergistically, where lightning helps the CNN focus on which neighboring locations are most important. Synthetic inputs are used to quantify the sensitivity to radiance gradients, showing that sharper gradients produce a stronger response in predicted reflectivity. Lightning observations are found to be uniquely valuable for their ability to pinpoint locations of strong radar echoes.},

abstract = {South-central New Mexico, USA, at the junction of
the Rocky Mountains, High Plains and Chihuahuan
Desert, is one of the better known regions in the
late Quaternary of North America. Plant macrofossils
and pollen from a packrat midden series in Rough
Canyon, New Mexico allows refinement of plant
distributions and paleoclimates in this transitional
area since full glacial times. From 17000 to 12000
C-14 yr BP, Pinus edulis-Juniperus scopulorum
woodlands dominated limestone substrates between
1800 and 1490 m. with Pseudotsuga menziesii and
other mixed-conifer species restricted to shady,
north-facing slopes. Juniperus deppeana, the
dominant juniper today above 2000 m in southern New
Mexico, is conspicuously absent from glacial middens
and must have been displaced south of the US-Mexico
border. The minimum climatic conditions for
P. edulis-J. scopulorum woodlands are ca 20{\%} wetter
and 3.5-5 degreesC cooler (July mean maximum
temperatures) than the modern climate at Rough
Canyon. Holocene warming/drying may have started as
early as 12 000 C-14 yr BP with the extirpation of
J. scopulorum from Rough Canyon, and was completed
by at least 10 540 C-14 yr BP. The record for
arrivals of some desert species is confounded by
traces of pollen and macrofossils in some of the
glacial middens, which could signify either earliest
occurrence or temporal mixing (contamination) of
assemblages. AMS C-14 dating can discriminate
between early arrival and contamination in midden
macrofossils but not in pollen. AMS dates show that
Choisya dumosa, presently near its northern (cold)
limits at Rough Canyon, endured late glacial
winters, possibly as clonal populations. Some Larrea
tridentata leaves and pollen occur in middens
dominated by conifers and oaks no longer at the
site; an AMS date of 3205 C-14 yr BP on Larrea
leaves from one midden indicates
contamination. Evidence for some macrofossil
contamination, however, does not rule out the
possibility that pollen of desert elements
(e.g. Larrea, Prosopis) in late glacial-early
Holocene middens indicates their presence in the
Tularosa Basin, well ahead of their local appearance
in Rough Canyon. Finally, the increasing dominance
of desert elements after 5000 C-14 yr BP in the
Rough Canyon series and elsewhere in the northern
Chihuahuan Desert could reflect slow, postglacial
migration from the south and/or progressive
encroachment with gradual stripping of soils formed
during the last glacial period. (C) 2001 Elsevier

The reliability of models' simulations is often gauged by their ability to reproduce the historical climate across many time scales. This study compares the global mean surface air temperature from 29 CMIP6 models with observations from three datasets. We examine (1) warming and cooling rates in five subperiods from 1880 to 2014, (2) autocorrelation and long-term persistence, (3) models' performance based on probabilistic and entropy metrics, and (4) the distributional shape of temperature. All models simulate the observed long-term warming trend from 1880 to 2014. The late twentieth century warming (1975–2014) and the hiatus (1942–1975) are replicated by most models. The post-1998 warming is overestimated in 90{\%} of the simulations. Only six out of 29 models reproduce the observed long-term persistence. All models show differences in distributional shape when compared with observations. Varying performance across metrics reveals the challenge to determine the “best” model. Thus, we argue that models should be selected, based on case-specific metrics, depending on the intended use. Metrics proposed here facilitate a comprehensive assessment for various applications.},

fluctuations in the North Pacific on scales between
ENSO and the centennial trend and is commonly
referred to as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation or
PDO. We include a historical overview and a summary
of observational work that describes the surface,
tropospheric and subsurface signatures of this
variability. Descriptions of interdecadal
variability are incomplete at best, mostly due to
limitations in the observational record. We
emphasize that the well-known "ENSO-like" sea

may not be an accurate representation. In the
eastern tropical Pacific, the SST maxima are
displaced north and south of the equator with larger
amplitudes in the northern branch near the coast of
North America, which has significant implications
for the troposphere-driven circulations. Several
mechanisms have been proposed to explain the PDO. We
review these mechanisms and models, which capture

Sea ice concentrations (SIC) derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) using the Bootstrap (BST) algorithm fail to show the lead occurrences, as is visible in the MODIS images. In contrast, SIC derived from AMSR2 using the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study (ARTIST) sea ice algorithm (ASI) reveal the lead structure, due to the higher spatial resolution possible when using 89-GHz channel data. The ASI SIC are calculated from brightness temperatures interpolated on three different grids with resolutions of 3.125 km (ASI-3k), 6.25 km (ASI-6k) and 12.5 km (ASI-12k) to investigate the effect of the spatial resolution. Single-swath data is used to study the effect of temporal sampling in comparison to daily averages. For a region of interest in the Beaufort Sea, BST and ASI-3k show area-averaged SIC of 97{\%}±0.7{\%} and 93{\%}±7.0{\%}, respectively. For ASI-6k, the area-averaged SIC are similar to ASI-3k, while ASI-12k data show more agreement with BST. Visual comparison with MODIS True Color imagery exhibits good agreement with ASI-3k. In particular, ASI-3k are able to reproduce lead structure and size in the sea ice cover, which are not or are less visible in the other SIC data. The results will be valuable for selecting a SIC data product for studies of the interaction between ocean, ice, and atmosphere in the polar regions.},

This separation allows the quantification of both the forced signal under climate change and the internal variability to unprecedented precision. We then demonstrate multiple ways to evaluate MPI-GE and put observations in the context of a large ensemble, including a novel approach for comparing model internal variability with estimated observed variability. Finally, we present four novel analyses, which can only be completed using a large ensemble. First, we address whether temperature and precipitation have a pathway dependence using the forcing scenarios. Second, the forced signal of the highly noisy atmospheric circulation is computed, and different drivers are identified to be important for the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions. Third, we use the ensemble dimension to investigate the time dependency of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation variability changes under global warming. Last, sea level pressure is used as an example to demonstrate how MPI-GE can be utilized to estimate the ensemble size needed for a given scientific problem and provide insights for future ensemble projects.},

Pacific Ekman pumping. The SST response patterns to
these processes are not orthogonal, and they
determine the spatial characteristics of the
PDO. The importance of the different forcing,
processes is frequency dependent. At interannual
time scales, forcing from ENSO and the Aleutian low
determines the response in equal parts. At decadal
time scales, zonal advection in the Kuroshio-Oyashio
Extension, ENSO, and anomalies of the Aleutian low

the PDO is not a dynamical mode, but arises from the

show that the North Pacific oscillation (NPO) exerts
a modulating effect on ENSO teleconnections. Sea
lever pressure (SLP) data over the North Pacific,
North America, and the North Atlantic and daily
rainfall records in the contiguous United States are
used to demonstrate that typical ENSO signals tend
to be stronger and more stable during preferred
phases of the NPO. Typical El Nino patterns (e.g.,
low pressure over the northeastern Pacific, dry
northwest, and wet southwest, etc.) are strong and
consistent only during the high phase of the NPO,
which is associated with an anomalously cold
northwestern Pacific. The generally reversed SLP and
precipitation patterns during La Nina winters are
consistent only during the low NPO phase. Climatic
anomalies tend to be weak and spatially incoherent
during low NPO-El Nino and high NPO-La Nina
winters. These results suggest that confidence in
ENSO-based long-range climate forecasts for North
America should reflect interdecadal climatic
anomalies in the North Pacific.},

An additional minor contribution from the North Atlantic, by contrast, appears to exhibit some predictability.

The interface represents a sloping inversion layer coupling the two layers. The shape of the interface can be approximated by a cubic polynomial, and the interfacial coupling condition yields a set of algebraic equations that quantify the scale and intensity of the dammed flow as functions of the external parameters characterizing the environmental conditions. It is found that the cold dome shrinks as the Froude number increases or, to a minor degree, as the Ekman number decreases or/and the upstream inflow veers from northeasterly to southeasterly (with respect to a longitudinal mountain to the west).

The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of 38 CMIP5 climate models to provide further evidence that models produce warming hiatus periods during warming experiments. GST rates are simulated in each model for the 21st century using two experiments: a moderate warming scenario (RCP4.5) and high-end scenario (RCP8.5). Warming hiatus periods are identified in model simulations by detecting (1) ≥15-year periods lacking a statistically meaningful trend and (2) rapid changes in the GST rate which resemble the observed 1998–2012 hiatus. Under the RCP4.5 experiment, all tested models produce warming hiatus periods. However, once radiative forcing exceeds 5 W/m 2 —about 2°C GST increase—as simulated in the RCP8.5 experiment after 2050, nearly all models produce only positive warming trends. All models show evidence of rapid changes in the GST rate resembling the observed hiatus, showing that the climate variations associated with warming hiatus periods are still evident in the models, even under accelerated warming conditions. },

The program also enables the use of other popular standardisation methods. A series of experiments is described in which the ability of simple RCS and SF RCS to recover known tree-growth forcing signals is tested. In the comparatively rare situation where many sub-fossil data are distributed over a wide time range and there is no slope in the overall common-growth forcing signal, simple RCS is satisfactory. Simple RCS produces distortion in all other examples explored here. SF RCS is superior to simple RCS and in all cases examined. SF RCS works well except when the span of starting dates of sample trees is too narrow, a situation for which a test is available. Based on the results of the tests explored here, we conclude that Signal-Free RCS should be used as the standard method of RCS processing.},

abstract = {Using the JRA-55 reanalysis datasets and radiosonde observations, the impact of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) on the downward extension of stratospheric Northern Annular Mode (NAM) signals in its positive and negative phases (positive and negative NAM hereafter) is examined. The results show that the average number of days per month on which stratospheric negative NAM signals extend downward into the troposphere is more than twice as large during the easterly phase of the QBO (EQBO) as those during the westerly phase of the QBO (WQBO). The increasing likelihood of downward extension of stratospheric negative NAM signals during the EQBO is related to three factors: enhanced upward wave-1 fluxes entering the stratosphere, anomalous poleward wave fluxes below 100 hPa and EQBO-induced residual circulation. It is also revealed that the EQBO-induced subtropical tropospheric easterly anomalies lead to positive height anomalies over the subtropical North Atlantic, which are amplified by transient eddies and maintained by convection. These subtropical positive height anomalies further stimulate an anomalous wave train, forcing subpolar positive height anomalies over the Euro-Atlantic sector and enhancing wave 1. Over the Pacific, the EQBO could also induce positive height anomalies in the tropical troposphere, and these anomalies are related to convection and vertical motion. The positive height anomalies can induce anomalous poleward-propagating waves, forcing negative height anomalies over the North Pacific at mid-high latitudes and the enhancing wave 1. Fewer stratospheric positive NAM signals extend downward into the troposphere during the EQBO than during the WQBO, with mechanisms similar to those of negative NAM.},

around 2.2- and 2.7-yr periods: two interannual

the fifth band at the quasi-decadal frequency is
centered around 11.4-yr period. Between 1920 and
1955, the quasi-decadal band is less prominent
compared to the quasi-biennial bands. This happens
to be the period when SLP gradually increased over
the Greenland-Iceland regions. The spatial pattern
at the quasi-decadal frequency displays an
out-of-phase relationship in the SLP in the vicinity
of the subtropical anticyclones in both hemispheres
(indicative of an out-of-phase quasi-decadal
variability in the North and South Atlantic Hadley
circulation). The quasi-decadal frequency also
displays an out-of-phase relationship in the SSTs
north and south of the mean position of the
intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). This
short-lived structure, lasting for approximately two
years, supports the argument that a tropical SST
dipole pattern is one of the characteristics of the
quasi-decadal signal. All five frequency bands
represent to some extent fluctuations of the North
Atlantic oscillation and are associated with
tropical Atlantic Ocean warming (cooling) with
different spatial evolution. The two interannual
bands show opposite SST evolution to the south of
the ITCZ, that is, southeastward evolution from the
western tropical Atlantic for the 3.5-yr period and
westward spreading from the eastern tropical
Atlantic for the 4.4-yr period. Moreover, a
significant coherence (with a 1-yr phase lag) is
found between the SST time series along the
equatorial Atlantic obtained from the 3.5-yr period,
and the SST time series in the NINO3 area in the
Pacific. It is cautiously argued that the 3.5-yr
period is largely associated with the global El
Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. while the
evolution of the 4.4-yr period depends more upon
Atlantic local conditions.},

abstract = {The early twentieth-century warming (EW; 1910–45) and the mid-twentieth-century cooling (MC; 1950–80) have been linked to both internal variability of the climate system and changes in external radiative forcing. The degree to which either of the two factors contributed to EW and MC, or both, is still debated. Using a two-box impulse response model, we demonstrate that multidecadal ocean variability was unlikely to be the driver of observed changes in global mean surface temperature (GMST) after AD 1850. Instead, virtually all (97{\%}–98{\%}) of the global low-frequency variability ({\textgreater}30 years) can be explained by external forcing. We find similarly high percentages of explained variance for interhemispheric and land–ocean temperature evolution. Three key aspects are identified that underpin the conclusion of this new study: inhomogeneous anthropogenic aerosol forcing (AER), biases in the instrumental sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, and inadequate representation of the response to varying forcing factors. Once the spatially heterogeneous nature of AER is accounted for, the MC period is reconcilable with external drivers. SST biases and imprecise forcing responses explain the putative disagreement between models and observations during the EW period. As a consequence, Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) is found to be primarily controlled by external forcing too. Future attribution studies should account for these important factors when discriminating between externally forced and internally generated influences on climate. We argue that AMV must not be used as a regressor and suggest a revised AMV index instead [the North Atlantic Variability Index (NAVI)]. Our associated best estimate for the transient climate response (TCR) is 1.57 K (±0.70 at the 5{\%}–95{\%} confidence level).},

abstract = {A new field of study, ``decadal prediction,{\{}''{\}} is
emerging in climate science. Decadal prediction lies
between seasonal/interannual forecasting and
longer-term climate change projections, and focuses
on time-evolving regional climate conditions over
the next 10-30 yr. Numerous assessments of climate
information user needs have identified this time
scale as being important to infrastructure planners,
water resource managers, and many others. It is
central to the information portfolio required to
adapt effectively to and through climatic
changes. At least three factors influence
time-evolving regional climate at the decadal time
scale: 1) climate change commitment (further warming
as the coupled climate system comes into adjustment
with increases of greenhouse gases that have already
occurred), 2) external forcing, particularly from
future increases of greenhouse gases and recovery of
the ozone hole, and 3) internally generated
variability. Some decadal prediction skill has been
demonstrated to arise from the first two of these
factors, and there is evidence that initialized
coupled climate models can capture mechanisms of
internally generated decadal climate variations,
thus increasing predictive skill globally and
particularly regionally. Several methods have been
proposed for initializing global coupled climate
models for decadal predictions, all of which involve
global time-evolving threedimensional ocean data,
including temperature and salinity. An experimental
framework to address decadal
predictability/prediction is described in this paper
and has been incorporated into the coordinated
Coupled Model Intercomparison Model, phase 5 (CMIP5)
experiments, some of which will be assessed for the
IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). These
experiments will likely guide work in this emerging
field over the next 5 yr.},

abstract = {Variations in fire regimes can be inferred from
changes in the abundance of sedimentary charcoal
found in lake and bog sediments. When analysed with
pollen data, inferences can be made about past
vegetation dynamics and climate as well. The
analysis of high-resolution charcoal records
generally involves the decomposition of charcoal
influx into (a) a slowly varying 'background'
component that provides information about long-term
changes in regional fire activity, biomass and/or
depositional processes, and (b) a 'peaks' component
that represents local fire events. In this study, 15
high-resolution charcoal records from the
northwestern USA and associated pollen data were
examined to describe the variations and controls of
charcoal influx and background trends. Late-Holocene
charcoal influx levels at each site were compared
with late-Holocene sedimentation rates, vegetation
and fire frequency, and with modern climate and
physical site characteristics to better understand
the spatial variability in charcoal
abundance. Charcoal abundance was largely determined
by physical site characteristics (eg, lake and
watershed size) and the proportion of woody
taxa. Background trends displayed regional
similarities, - closely with woody taxa proportions
in and the subcontinental scale trend based on all
records correlated the pollen spectra. Background
charcoal and woody taxa proportions increased
together from minima in the Late Glacial to maxima
in the late Holocene. The strong similarity in these
trends suggests that background charcoal influx is a
function of fuel characteristics, which in turn are
governed by climate and vegetation. Variations in
sedimentation rate and fire frequency had little
influence on background charcoal trends.},

abstract = {The evolution of a hurricane—how the track, intensity, forward speed, and resulting hazard effects on land (strong winds, flooding) develop over its lifetime—is often highly uncertain. Further, the uncertainty is dynamic because it is resolved as events unfold until ultimately the storm's evolution is known completely, and because the ensemble of forecasts changes over time. Emergency managers recognize these challenges and may engage in some combination of robust, adaptive, or repeated planning to address them. However, science- and engineering-based evacuation decision support models typically do not formally incorporate uncertainty. This article discusses the use of formal modeling to support robust, adaptive, and repeated decision-making during an impending hurricane. It also details a case study of Hurricane Isabel (2003) in North Carolina using the recently introduced Integrated Scenario-based Evacuation (ISE) computational framework to compare the effects of including each of the three features in the modeling. Findings suggest that making the evacuation planning robust, adaptive, and repeated should improve results by reducing both the numbers of people at risk and unnecessary evacuation orders and travel. The magnitude of those benefits, however, depends on uncertainty in, and evolution of, the attributes of the particular hurricane.},

abstract = {This study presents a description of the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) in a multicentury preindustrial simulation of the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2). The model simulates several aspects of ENSO relatively well, including dominant timescale, tropical and extratropical precursors, composite evolution of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events, and ENSO teleconnections. The good model representation of ENSO spectral characteristics is consistent with the spatial pattern of the anomalous equatorial zonal wind stress in the model, which results in the correct adjustment timescale of the equatorial thermocline according to the delayed/recharge oscillator paradigms, as also reflected in the realistic time evolution of the equatorial Warm Water Volume. PDV in the model exhibits a pattern that is very similar to the observed, with realistic tropical and South Pacific signatures which were much weaker in some of the CESM2 predecessor models. The tropical component of PDV also shows an association with ENSO decadal modulation which is similar to that found in observations. However, the ENSO amplitude is about 30{\%} larger than observed in the preindustrial CESM2 simulation, and even larger in the historical ensemble, perhaps as a result of anthropogenic influences. In contrast to observations, the largest variability is found in the central Pacific rather than in the eastern Pacific, a discrepancy that somewhat hinders the model's ability to represent a full diversity in El Ni{\~{n}}o spatial patterns and appears to be associated with an unrealistic confinement of the precipitation anomalies to the western Pacific.},

abstract = {The effective radiative forcing, which includes the instantaneous forcing plus adjustments from the atmosphere and surface, has emerged as the key metric of evaluating human and natural influence on the climate. We evaluate effective radiative forcing and adjustments in 17 contemporary climate models that are participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and have contributed to the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP). Present-day (2014) global-mean anthropogenic forcing relative to pre-industrial (1850) levels from climate models stands at 2.00 (0:23) Wm2, comprised of 1.81 (0:09) Wm2 from CO2, 1.08 ( 0.21) Wm2 from other well-mixed greenhouse gases, 1:01 ( 0.23) Wm2 from aerosols and 0:09 (0:13) Wm2 from land use change. Quoted uncertainties are 1 standard deviation across model best estimates, and 90 confidence in the reported forcings, due to internal variability, is typically within 0.1 Wm2. The majority of the remaining 0:21Wm2 is likely to be from ozone. In most cases, the largest contributors to the spread in effective radiative forcing (ERF) is from the instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF) and from cloud responses, particularly aerosol-cloud interactions to aerosol forcing. As determined in previous studies, cancellation of tropospheric and surface adjustments means that the stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing is approximately equal to ERF for greenhouse gas forcing but not for aerosols, and consequentially, not for the anthropogenic total. The spread of aerosol forcing ranges from 0:63 to 1:37Wm2, exhibiting a less negative mean and narrower range compared to 10 CMIP5 models. The spread in 4CO2 forcing has also narrowed in CMIP6 compared to 13 CMIP5 models. Aerosol forcing is uncorrelated with climate sensitivity. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the increasing spread in climate sensitivity in CMIP6 models, particularly related to high-sensitivity models, is a consequence of a stronger negative present-day aerosol forcing and little evidence that modelling groups are systematically tuning climate sensitivity or aerosol forcing to recreate observed historical warming.},

abstract = {Categorization of storm surge with the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale has been a useful means of communicating potential impacts for decades. However, storm surge was removed from this scale following Hurricane Katrina (2005), leaving no scale-based method for storm surge risk communication despite its significant impacts on life and property. This study seeks to create a new, theoretical storm surge scale based on fiscal damage for effective risk analysis. Advanced Circulation model simulation output data of maximum water height and velocity were obtained for four storms: Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Gustav, Hurricane Ike, and Superstorm Sandy. Four countywide fiscal loss methods were then considered. The first three use National Centers for Environmental Information Storm Events Database (SED) property damages and Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) population, per capita personal income, or total income. The fourth uses National Flood Insurance Program total insured coverage and paid claims. Initial correlations indicated the statistical mode of storm surge data above the 90th percentile was most skillful; this metric was therefore chosen to represent countywide storm surge. Multiple linear regression assessed the most skillful combination of storm surge variables (height and velocity) and fiscal loss method (SED property damages and BEA population, i.e., loss per capita), and defined the proposed scale, named the Kuykendall scale. Comparison with the four storms' actual losses shows skillful performance, notably a 20{\%} skill increase over surge heightonly approaches. The Kuykendall scale demonstrates promise for skillful future storm surge risk assessment in the analytical, academic, and operational domains.},

The computed wave structures in the meridional section show good agreement with the observed state for the component of zonal wavenumber 1. For wavenumber 2, the computed amplitude is too small to compare with the observed. Wave energy density attains a maximum in the lower and middle stratosphere at high altitudes, where strong upward transfer of wave energy appears.

abstract = {A 1000 year reconstruction of cool-season
(November-April) precipitation was developed for
each climate division in Arizona and New Mexico from
a network of 19 tree-ring chronologies in the
southwestern USA. Linear regression (LR) and
artificial neural network (NN) models were used to
identify the cool-season precipitation signal in
tree rings. Using 1931-88 records, the stepwise LR
model was cross-validated with a leave-one-out
procedure and the NN was validated with a bootstrap
technique. The final models were also independently
validated using the 1896-1930 precipitation data. In
most of the climate divisions, both techniques can
successfully reconstruct dry and normal years, and
the NN seems to capture large precipitation events
and more variability better than the LR. In the 1000
year reconstructions. the NN also produces more
distinctive wet events and more variability, whereas
the LR produces more distinctive dry events. The
1000 year reconstructed precipitation from the two
models shows several sustained dry and wet periods
comparable to the 1950s drought (e.g. 16th century
mega drought) and to the post-1976 wet period (e.g.
1330s, 1610s). The impact of extreme periods on the
environment may be stronger during sudden reversals
from dry to wet, which were not uncommon throughout
the millennium, such as the 1610s wet interval that
followed the 16th century mega drought. The
instrumental records suggest that strong dry to wet
precipitation reversals in the past 1000 years might
be linked to strong shifts from cold to warm El
Nino-southern oscillation events And from a negative
to positive Pacific decadal oscillation. Copyright

abstract = {The salient features and drivers of wintertime warm and cold spells in the high Arctic are investigated. The analysis is based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis dataset. It is found that the warm spells are systematically associated with an intense sea level pressure and geopotential height anomaly dipole, displaying a low over the Arctic basin and a high over northern Eurasia. This configuration creates a natural pathway for extreme moisture influx episodes from the Atlantic sector into the Arctic (herein termed moisture intrusions). Anomalous cyclone frequency at the pole (largely attributable to local cyclogenesis) then favors a deep penetration of these intrusions across the Arctic basin. The large-scale circulation pattern associated with the warm spells further favors the advection of cold air across Siberia, leading to the so-called warm Arctic-cold Eurasia pattern previously discussed in the literature. On the contrary, cold Arctic extremes are associated with a severely reduced frequency of moisture intrusions and a persistent low pressure system over the pole. This effectively isolates the high latitudes from midlatitude air masses, favoring an intense radiative cooling of the polar region.},

abstract = {To reconstruct oceanographic variations in the
subtropical South Pacific, 271-year long subseasonal
time series of Sr/Ca and delta(18)O were generated
from a coral growing at Rarotonga (21.5degreesS,
159.5degreesW). In this case, coral Sr/Ca appears to
be an excellent proxy for sea surface temperature
(SST) and coral delta(18)O is a function of both SST
and seawater delta(18)O composition
(delta(18)O(sw)). Here, we focus on extracting the
delta(18)O(sw) signal from these proxy records. A
method is presented assuming that coral Sr/Ca is
solely a function of SST and that coral delta(18)O
is a function of both SST and delta(18)O(sw). This
method separates the effects of delta(18)O(sw) from
SST by breaking the instantaneous changes of coral
delta(18)O into separate contributions by
instantaneous SST and delta(18)O(sw) changes,
respectively. The results show that on average
delta(18)O(sw) at Rarotonga explains similar to39{\%}
of the variance in delta(18)O and that variations in
SST explains the remaining similar to61{\%} of
delta(18)O variance. Reconstructed delta(18)O(sw)
shows systematic increases in summer months
(December-February) consistent with the regional
pattern of variations in precipitation and
evaporation. The delta(18)O(sw) also shows a
positive linear correlation with satellite-derived
estimated salinity for the period 1980 to 1997 (r =
0.72). This linear correlation between reconstructed
delta(18)O(sw) and salinity makes it possible to use
the reconstructed delta(18)O(sw) to estimate the
past interannual and decadal salinity changes in
this region. Comparisons of coral delta(18)O and
delta(18)O(sw) at Rarotonga with the Pacific decadal
oscillation index suggest that the decadal and
interdecadal salinity and SST variability at
Rarotonga appears to be related to basin-scale
decadal variability in the Pacific. Copyright (C)

the amount of precipitation which is primarily
controlled by the mean latitudinal position of the

6180 values indicate a rapid northward displacement
in the mean latitudinal position of the summer ITCZ

correlating well with high-latitude temperature
variations recorded in Greenland ice cores. During
the middle to late Holocene the summer ITCZ
continuously migrated southward and monsoon
precipitation decreased gradually in response to
decreasing solar insolation, a trend, which is also
recorded in other monsoon records from the Indian
and East Asian monsoon domains. Importantly, there
is no evidence for an abrupt middle Holocene
weakening in monsoon precipitation. Although abrupt
monsoon events are apparent in all monsoon records,
they are short-lived and clearly superimposed on the
long-term trend of decreasing monsoon
precipitation. For the late Holocene there is an
anti-correlation between ISM precipitation in Oman
and inter-monsoon (spring/autumn) precipitation on
Socotra, revealing a possible long-term change in
the duration of the summer monsoon season since at
least 4.5 ka BP. Together with the progressive
shortening of the ISM season, gradual southward
retreat of the mean summer ITCZ and weakening of the
ISM, the total amount of precipitation decreased in
those areas located at the northern fringe of the
Indian and Asian monsoon domains, but increased in
areas closer to the equator. (c) 2006 Elsevier

abstract = {Soils are subject to varying degrees of direct or indirect human disturbance, constituting a major global change driver. Factoring out natural from direct and indirect human influence is not always straightforward, but some human activities have clear impacts. These include land use change, land management, and land degradation (erosion, compaction, sealing and salinization). The intensity of land use also exerts a great impact on soils, and soils are also subject to indirect impacts arising from human activity, such as acid deposition (sulphur and nitrogen) and heavy metal pollution. In this critical review, we report the state-of-the-art understanding of these global change pressures on soils, identify knowledge gaps and research challenges, and highlight actions and policies to minimise adverse environmental impacts arising from these global change drivers. Soils are central to considerations of what constitutes sustainable intensification. Therefore, ensuring that vulnerable and high environmental value soils are considered when protecting important habitats and ecosystems, will help to reduce the pressure on land from global change drivers. To ensure that soils are protected as part of wider environmental efforts, a global soil resilience programme should be considered, to monitor, recover or sustain soil fertility and function, and to enhance the ecosystem services provided by soils. Soils cannot, and should not, be considered in isolation of the ecosystems that they underpin and vice versa. The role of soils in supporting ecosystems and natural capital needs greater recognition. The lasting legacy of the International Year of Soils in 2015 should be to put soils at the centre of policy supporting environmental protection and sustainable development.

abstract = {It remains difficult to disentangle the relative influences of aerosols and greenhouse gases on regional surface temperature trends in the context of global climate change. To address this issue, we use a new collection of initial-condition large ensembles from the Community Earth System Model version 1 that are prescribed with different combinations of industrial aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing. To compare the climate response to these external forcings, we adopt an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture from previous work that predicts the year by training on maps of near-surface temperature. We then utilize layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize the regional temperature signals that are important for the ANN's prediction in each climate model experiment. To mask noise when extracting only the most robust climate patterns from LRP, we introduce a simple uncertainty metric that can be adopted to other explainable artificial intelligence (AI) problems. We find that the North Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and Southeast Asia are key regions of importance for the neural network to make its prediction, especially prior to the early-21st century. Notably, we also find that the ANN predictions based on maps of observations correlate higher to the actual year after training on the large ensemble experiment with industrial aerosols held fixed to 1920 levels. This work illustrates the sensitivity of regional temperature signals to changes in aerosol forcing in historical simulations. By using explainable AI methods, we have the opportunity to improve our understanding of (non)linear combinations of anthropogenic forcings in state-of-the-art global climate models.},

We also show that climate filtering conducted by individual trees creates major regional differences in information that may be recovered from the hemispheric network.

Two hurricanes that approached South Carolina but hit in North Carolina allowed us to study the impact of repeated "false alarms" (evacuations ordered based on expectations of a hurricane landfall that proved to be wrong). Differences in evacuation behavior, specific information and concerns prompting evacuation, and the reliability of information sources between hurricane events are examined to determine the impact of false alarms on the credibility of warning systems. Data were derived from a face-to-face survey of residents 2 weeks after Hurricane Fran in September 1996. We found that the role of official advisories was more limited than reported in previous research as people sought information on more diverse sets of concerns in their decision making. Reliance on the media and the Weather Channel, in particular, for storm characteristics and advisories was an important factor in evacuation decision making during both hurricane events. The perceived lack of reliability of gubernatorial warnings coupled with dependence on the media suggests that residents find other sources of information more personally relevant. Thus, while residents do not find that officials are "crying wolf," they are searching elsewhere for information to assess their own risk—what does it mean to me if there is a wolf? This increased attention toward individual differences in perceived threat may become more pronounced in future evacuations from hurricanes. {\textcopyright} 1998 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

bogs, however, the processes in geogeneous fens are
poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution
Holocene peat accumulation and macrofossil data from
a rich fen (Upper Pinto Fen (UPF)) in west-central
Alberta, Canada. The similar to8000-year chronology
of a 397 cm peat core was controlled by 20
accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dates. The
paludified peatland initially consisted of diverse
brown moss species and some Larix trees but was
dominated by Scorpidium scorpioides from 6500 to
1300 calibrated years BR The last 1300 years are
characterized by the reappearance of Larix together
with abundant woody materials and Cyperaccae,
culminating in a sharp increase in Tomenthypnum
nitens in the last several decades. During the
Scorpidium-dominated period, the peat accumulation
pattern derived from 15 14 C dates and 260 bulk
density measurements indicates declining mass
accumulation rates over time (i.e., convex age-depth
curve), in contrast with the standard bog growth
model (i.e., concave curve). The analysis of the UPF

to5000-year "convex period". Decreasing vegetation
production and (or) increasing acrotelm
decomposition could have produced the convex
pattern. Decreasing PAR might be owing to
autogenically induced changes in local hydrology and
nutrient availability, which are pronounced in the
moisture-limited climate of the region and in
peatlands that have a strong groundwater
influence. The convex-pattern model, explicit to the
height-induced long-term drying hypothesis, has
important implications for building simulation
models and for projecting future carbon dynamics of
peatlands. Prior to recent human disturbance, the
UPF site has a time-weighted mean carbon
accumulation rate of 31.1 g C.m(-2).year(-1),
ranging from 7.2 to 182.5 g C.m(-2).year(-1) during
the last 8000 years. This large variation results
from the gradual decline of long-term accumulation
and short-term climate-induced accumulation
"pulses". The results imply that in the absence of
climatic change, peatlands with a convex
accumulation pattern will reach their growth limit
sooner and that their carbon sequestration capacity
will decline faster than would be expected given the
concave-pattern model.},

abstract = {The decadal-scale variability in the tropical
Pacific has been analyzed herein by means of
observations and numerical model simulations. The
two leading modes of the sea surface temperature
(SST) variability in the central western Pacific are
a decadal mode with a period of about 10 yr and the
ENSO mode with a dominant period of about 4 yr. The
SST anomaly pattern of the decadal mode is ENSO
like. The decadal mode, however, explains most
variance in the western equatorial Pacific and off
the equator. A simulation with an ocean general
circulation model (OGCM) forced by reanalysis data
is used to explore the origin of the decadal
mode. It is found that the variability of the
shallow subtropical - tropical overturning cells is
an important factor in driving the decadal
mode. This is supported by results from a
multicentury integration with a coupled ocean -
atmosphere general circulation model (CGCM) that
realistically simulates tropical Pacific decadal
variability. Finally, the sensitivity of the shallow
subtropical - tropical overturning cells to
greenhouse warming is discussed by analyzing the
results of a scenario integration with the same

abstract = {Interactions between the tropical and subtropical northern Pacific at decadal time scales are examined using uncoupled oceanic and atmospheric simulations. An atmospheric model is forced with observed Pacific sea surface temperatures (SST) decadal anomalies, computed as the difference between the 2000–2009 and the 1990–1999 period. The resulting pattern has negative SST anomalies at the equator, with a global pattern reminiscent of the Pacific decadal oscillation. The tropical SST anomalies are responsible for driving a weakening of the Hadley cell and atmospheric meridional heat transport. The atmosphere is then shown to produce a significant response in the subtropics, with wind-stress-curl anomalies having the opposite sign from the climatological mean, consistent with a weakening of the oceanic subtropical gyre (STG). A global ocean model is then forced with the decadal anomalies from the atmospheric model. In the North Pacific, the shallow subtropical cell (STC) spins down and the meridional heat transport is reduced, resulting in positive tropical SST anomalies. The final tropical response is reached after the first 10 years of the experiment, consistent with the Rossby-wave adjustment time for both the STG and the STC. The STC provides the connection between subtropical wind stress anomalies and tropical SSTs. In fact, targeted simulations show the importance of off-equatorial wind stress anomalies in driving the oceanic response, whereas anomalous tropical winds have no role in the SST signal reversal. We further explore the connection between STG, STC and tropical SST with the help of an idealized model. We argue that, in our models, tropical SST decadal variability stems from the forcing of the Pacific subtropical gyre through the atmospheric response to ENSO. The resulting Ekman pumping anomaly alters the STC and oceanic heat transport, providing a negative feedback on the SST. We thus suggest that extratropical atmospheric responses to tropical forcing have feedbacks onto the ocean dynamics that lead to a time-delayed response of the tropical oceans, giving rise to a possible mechanism for multidecadal ocean-atmosphere coupled variability.},

These variables play important roles in the distribution and annual balance of sea ice volume within the basin. While it is not expected that uninitialized simulations agree completely with observations, these assessments serve to summarize ensemble behavior, as baselines for measuring improvements, and to evaluate reliability of CMIP3 simulations (and potentially CMIP5) for projection of decline rates of Arctic sea ice coverage. We find the model‐data differences and intermodel scatter in summarizing statistics are large. In a majority of model fields the mean high‐pressure pattern in the southern Beaufort is significantly displaced toward the central Arctic Basin, leading to difficulties in reproducing the mean spatial patterns of sea ice circulation, thickness, and ice export. Thus, even though the CMIP3 multimodel data set agrees that increased greenhouse gas concentrations will result in reductions of Arctic sea ice area and volume, these comparisons suggest considerable uncertainties in the projected rates of sea ice decline.},

abstract = {This review addresses the causes of observed climate variations across the industrial period, from 1750 to present. It focuses on long-term changes, both in response to external forcing and to climate variability in the ocean and atmosphere. A synthesis of results from attribution studies based on palaeoclimatic reconstructions covering the recent few centuries to the 20th century, and instrumental data shows how greenhouse gases began to cause warming since the beginning of industrialization, causing trends that are attributable to greenhouse gases by 1900 in proxy-based temperature reconstructions. Their influence increased over time, dominating recent trends. However, other forcings have caused substantial deviations from this emerging greenhouse warming trend: volcanic eruptions have caused strong cooling following a period of unusually heavy activity, such as in the early 19th century; or warming during periods of low activity, such as in the early-to-mid 20th century. Anthropogenic aerosol forcing most likely masked some global greenhouse warming over the 20th century, especially since the accelerated increase in sulphate aerosol emissions starting around 1950. Based on modelling and attribution studies, aerosol forcing has also influenced regional temperatures, caused long-term changes in monsoons and imprinted on Atlantic variability. Multi-decadal variations in atmospheric modes can also cause long-term climate variability, as apparent for the example of the North Atlantic Oscillation, and have influenced Atlantic ocean variability. Long-term precipitation changes are more difficult to attribute to external forcing due to spatial sparseness of data and noisiness of precipitation changes, but the observed pattern of precipitation response to warming from station data supports climate model simulated changes and with it, predictions. The long-term warming has also led to significant differences in daily variability as, for example, visible in long European station data. Extreme events over the historical record provide valuable samples of possible extreme events and their mechanisms.},

As such, attempts to emulate them using machine learning should reflect this. While the use of machine learning to emulate weather forecast models is a relatively new endeavour there is a rich history of climate model emulation. This is primarily because while weather modelling is an initial condition problem which intimately depends on the current state of the atmosphere, climate modelling is predominantly a boundary condition problem. In order to emulate the response of the climate to different drivers therefore, representation of the full dynamical evolution of the atmosphere is neither necessary, or in many cases, desirable. Climate scientists are typically interested in different questions also. Indeed emulating the steady-state climate response has been possible for many years and provides significant speed increases that allow solving inverse problems for e.g. parameter estimation. Nevertheless, the large datasets, non-linear relationships and limited training data make Climate a domain which is rich in interesting machine learning challenges. Here I seek to set out the current state of climate model emulation and demonstrate how, despite some challenges, recent advances in machine learning provide new opportunities for creating useful statistical models of the climate.},

Here the authors attempt to address this deficiency by designing a representation of cumulus convection with close attention paid to convective water fluxes and by subjecting the scheme to rigorous tests using sounding array data. The authors maintain that such tests, in which a single-column model is forced by large-scale processes measured by or inferred from the sounding data, must be carried out over a period at least as long as the radiative-subsidence timescale—about 30 days—governing the water vapor adjustment time.

abstract = {The rate of global mean surface temperature (GMST) warming has slowed this century despite the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. Climate model experiments show that this slowdown was largely driven by a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), with a smaller external contribution from solar variability, and volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols. The prevailing view is that this negative PDO occurred through internal variability. However, here we show that coupled models from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project robustly simulate a negative PDO in response to anthropogenic aerosols implying a potentially important role for external human influences. The recovery from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 also contributed to the slowdown in GMST trends. Our results suggest that a slowdown in GMST trends could have been predicted in advance, and that future reduction of anthropogenic aerosol emissions, particularly from China, would promote a positive PDO and increased GMST trends over the coming years. Furthermore, the overestimation of the magnitude of recent warming by models is substantially reduced by using detection and attribution analysis to rescale their response to external factors, especially cooling following volcanic eruptions. Improved understanding of external influences on climate is therefore crucial to constrain near-term climate predictions.},

Here convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning are used for predicting the EASM. The results of the constructed CNN regression model show that the prediction of the CNN regression model is highly consistent with the reanalysis dataset, with correlation coefficient of 0.78, which is higher than that of each of the current state-of-the-art dynamic models. The heat map method indicates that the robust precursor signals in the CNN regression model agree well with previous theoretical studies, and can provide the quantitative contribution of different signals for EASM prediction. The CNN regression model can predict the EASM one year ahead with a confidence level above 95{\%}. The above method can not only improve the prediction of the EASM but also help to identify the involved physical predictors.},

abstract = {We determine the structure of a network of sites
from which coral-based, proxy measurements of sea

error in a reconstruction of the large-scale

of coral-derived SST observational error and several
minimization criteria, sites in the equatorial
oceans, especially the central and eastern
equatorial Pacific, best minimize the error in the
reconstruction. If the observational error is
sufficiently low, additional optimal sites are in
selected subtropical lo,cations. If the
observational error is high, the error is minimized
by resampling the most important equatorial

diminishes rapidly and is not sensitive to the size
of the observational error: two sites reduce the
analysis error by half as much as 10 sites, while
the first 6-7 sites achieve half the error reduction
of all 65 sites in the analysis domain. In the
extratropics the reduction of reconstruction error
is small and gradual, while error in the tropical
Pacific is sharply reduced by 2-3 sites and
gradually thereafter. These results suggest that a

A coupled ice–ocean model is used to determine the state of the ice and ocean over the past 29 yr to investigate the causes of this ice extent minimum within a historical perspective. It is found that even though the 2007 ice extent was strongly anomalous, the loss in total ice mass was not. Rather, the 2007 ice mass loss is largely consistent with a steady decrease in ice thickness that began in 1987. Since then, the simulated mean September ice thickness within the Arctic Ocean has declined from 3.7 to 2.6 m at a rate of −0.57 m decade−1. Both the area coverage of thin ice at the beginning of the melt season and the total volume of ice lost in the summer have been steadily increasing. The combined impact of these two trends caused a large reduction in the September mean ice concentration in the Arctic Ocean. This created conditions during the summer of 2007 that allowed persistent winds to pus...},

Two mechanisms, the top-down stratospheric response of ozone to fluctuations of shortwave solar forcing and the bottom-up coupled ocean-atmosphere surface response, are included in versions of three global climate models, with either mechanism acting alone or both acting together. We show that the two mechanisms act together to enhance the climatological off-equatorial tropical precipitation maxima in the Pacific, lower the eastern equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures during peaks in the 11-year solar cycle, and reduce low-latitude clouds to amplify the solar forcing at the surface.},

required to address changes in climate. As an aid to
understanding and supporting informed
decision-making regarding transformative change, we
draw on theories from both the resilience and

Action Cycles concept and applied framework. The
resulting Adaptation Action Cycles provides a novel
conceptualisation of incremental and transformative
adaptation as a continuous process depicted by two
concentric and distinct, yet linked, action learning
cycles. Each cycle represents four stages in the
decision-making process, which are considered to be
undertaken over relatively short timeframes. The
concept is translated into an applied framework by
adopting a contextual, actor-focused suite of
questions at each of the four stages. This approach
compliments existing theories of transition and
transformation by operationalising assessments at
the individual and enterprise level. Empirical
validation of the concept was conducted by
collaborating with members of the Australian wine
industry to assess their decisions and actions taken
in response to climate change. The contiguous stages
represented in the Adaptation Action Cycles aptly
reflected the diverse range of decision-making and
action pathways taken in recent years by those
interviewed. Results suggest that incremental
adaptation decision-making processes have distinct
characteristics, compared with those used in
transformative adaptation. We provide empirical data

are either weak or absent in drought reconstructions
from northwestern North America, and tree-ring
estimates of PDSI show a much less robust
association with the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation. Geographical differences in the
relative strength of seasonal precipitation signals
are likely due to (i) local factors that influence
tree growth but are not incorporated into the PDSI

abstract = {Abstract The geostrophic adjustment process for a rotating, stratified atmosphere in the presence of an orographic barrier may be manifest as a phenomenon known as “cold-air damming” (CAD). The degree of blocking by an orographic barrier, and therefore CAD intensity, is related to the static stability of the upstream air mass. When precipitation falls into dry near-surface air, differential evaporational cooling can increase static stability, and strengthen or initiate CAD. The sheltering effect of clouds can also maintain surface-based stability. Therefore, the ability of numerical forecast models to accurately predict CAD requires adequate representation of cloud and precipitation processes. Operational forecasters in the Appalachian damming region have previously developed a subjective classification scheme that distinguishes those CAD events that are heavily influenced by diabatic processes from those that are dominated by synoptic-scale forcing. In this study the subjective scheme is formalized in or...},

However, until now, there have been only limited assessments of riverine heat impacts. Here, we adopted a synthesis of a pan-Arctic sea ice-ocean model and a land surface model to quantify impacts of river heat on the Arctic sea ice and ocean heat budget. We show that river heat contributed up to 10{\%} of the regional sea ice reduction over the Arctic shelves from 1980 to 2015. Particularly notable, this effect occurs as earlier sea ice breakup in late spring and early summer. The increasing ice-free area in the shelf seas results in a warmer ocean in summer, enhancing ocean-atmosphere energy exchange and atmospheric warming. Our findings suggest that a positive river heat-sea ice feedback nearly doubles the river heat effect.},

Observations from earlier periods are limited but suggest an additional negative radiative forcing of about --0.1 watt per square meter from 1960 to 1990.

abstract = {The ocean component of the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) is described, and its solutions from the twentieth-century (20C) simulations are documented in comparison with observations and those of CCSM3. The improvements to the ocean model physical processes include new parameterizations to represent previously missing physics and modifications of existing parameterizations to incorporate recent new developments. In comparison with CCSM3, the new solutions show some significant improvements that can be attributed to these model changes. These include a better equatorial current structure, a sharper thermocline, and elimination of the cold bias of the equatorial cold tongue all in the Pacific Ocean; reduced sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity biases along the North Atlantic Current path; and much smaller potential temperature and salinity biases in the near-surface Pacific Ocean. Other improvements include a global-mean SST that is more consistent with the present-day observations due to a different spinup procedure from that used in CCSM3. Despite these improvements, many of the biases present in CCSM3 still exist in CCSM4. A major concern continues to be the substantial heat content loss in the ocean during the preindustrial control simulation from which the 20C cases start. This heat loss largely reflects the top of the atmospheric model heat loss rate in the coupled system, and it essentially determines the abyssal ocean potential temperature biases in the 20C simulations. There is also a deep salty bias in all basins. As a result of this latter bias in the deep North Atlantic, the parameterized overflow waters cannot penetrate much deeper than in CCSM3. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {We compare the mass budget of the Arctic sea ice for 14 models submitted to the latest Climate Model 25 Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6), using new diagnostics that have not been available for previous model inter-comparisons. Using these diagnostics allows us to look beyond the standard metrics of ice cover and thickness, to compare the processes of sea ice growth and loss in climate models in a more detailed way than has previously been possible. For the 1960-89 multi-model mean, the dominant processes causing annual ice growth are basal growth and frazil 30 ice formation, which both occur during the winter. The main processes by which ice is lost are basal melting, top melting and advection of ice out of the Arctic. The first two processes occur in summer, while the latter process is present all year. The sea-ice budgets for individual models are strikingly similar overall in terms of the major processes causing ice growth and loss, and in terms of the time of year during which each process is important. However, there are also some key differences between the models. The relative amounts of frazil and basal ice 35 formation varies between the models. This is, to some extent at least, attributable to exactly how the frazil growth is formulated within each model. There are also differences in the relative amounts of top and basal melting. As the ice cover and mass decline during the 21 st century, we see a shift in the timing of the top and basal melting in the multi-model mean, with more melt occurring earlier in the year, and less melt later in the summer.

abstract = {A suite of historical atmospheric model simulations is described that uses a hierarchy of global boundary forcings designed to inform research on the detection and attribution of weather and climate-related extremes. In addition to experiments forced by actual variations in sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, and atmospheric chemical composition (so-called Factual experiments); additional (Counterfactual) experiments are conducted in which the boundary forcings are adjusted by removing estimates of long-term climate change. A third suite of experiments are identical to the Factual runs except that sea ice concentrations are set to climatological conditions (Clim-Polar experiments). These were used to investigate the cause for extremely warm Arctic surface temperature during 2016. Much of the magnitude of surface temperature anomalies averaged poleward of 65°N in 2016 (3.2 ± 0.6 °C above a 1980–89 reference) is shown to have been forced by observed global boundary conditions. The Factual experiments reveal that at least three quarters of the magnitude of 2016 annual mean Arctic warmth was forced, with considerable sensitivity to assumptions of sea ice thickness change. Results also indicate that 30–40{\%} of the overall forced Arctic warming signal in 2016 originated from drivers outside of the Arctic. Despite such remote effects, the experiments reveal that the extreme magnitude of the 2016 Arctic warmth could not have occurred without consideration of the Arctic sea ice loss. We find a near-zero probability for Arctic surface temperature to be as warm as occurred in 2016 under late-19th century boundary conditions, and also under 2016 boundary conditions that do not include the depleted Arctic sea ice. Results from the atmospheric model experiments are reconciled with coupled climate model simulations which lead to a conclusion that about 60{\%} of the 2016 Arctic warmth was likely attributable to human-induced climate change.},

abstract = {For generations, climate scientists have educated the public that ‘weather is not climate', and climate change has been framed as the change in the distribution of weather that slowly emerges from large variability over decades1–7. However, weather when considered globally is now in uncharted territory. Here we show that on the basis of a single day of globally observed temperature and moisture, we detect the fingerprint of externally driven climate change, and conclude that Earth as a whole is warming. Our detection approach invokes statistical learning and climate model simulations to encapsulate the relationship between spatial patterns of daily temperature and humidity, and key climate change metrics such as annual global mean temperature or Earth's energy imbalance. Observations are projected onto this relationship to detect climate change. The fingerprint of climate change is detected from any single day in the observed global record since early 2012, and since 1999 on the basis of a year of data. Detection is robust even when ignoring the long-term global warming trend. This complements traditional climate change detection, but also opens broader perspectives for the communication of regional weather events, modifying the climate change narrative: while changes in weather locally are emerging over decades, global climate change is now detected instantaneously.},

abstract = {Current state-of-the-art global climate models produce different values for Earth's mean temperature. When comparing simulations with each other and with observations, it is standard practice to compare temperature anomalies with respect to a reference period. It is not always appreciated that the choice of reference period can affect conclusions, both about the skill of simulations of past climate and about the magnitude of expected future changes in climate. For example, observed global temperatures over the past decade are toward the lower end of the range of the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations irrespective of what reference period is used, but exactly where they lie in the model distribution varies with the choice of reference period. Additionally, we demonstrate that projections of when particular temperature levels are reached, for example, 2 K above "preindustrial," change by up to a decade depending on the choice of reference period. In this article, we discuss some of the key issues that arise when using anomalies relative to a reference period to generate climate projections. We highlight that there is no perfect choice of reference period. When evaluating models against observations, a long reference period should generally be used, but how long depends on the quality of the observations available. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) choice to use a 1986-2005 reference period for future global temperature projections was reasonable, but a case-by-case approach is needed for different purposes and when assessing projections of different climate variables. Finally, we recommend that any studies that involve the use of a reference period should explicitly examine the robustness of the conclusions to alternative choices.},

To circumvent this issue, here we explore the feasibility of training various machine learning approaches on a large climate model ensemble, providing a long training set with physically consistent model realizations. After training on thousands of seasons of climate model simulations, the machine learning models are tested for producing seasonal forecasts across the historical observational period (1980-2020). For forecasting large-scale spatial patterns of precipitation across the western United States, here we show that these machine learning-based models are capable of competing with or outperforming existing dynamical models from the North American Multi Model Ensemble. We further show that this approach need not be considered a ‘black box' by utilizing machine learning interpretability methods to identify the relevant physical processes that lead to prediction skill. Seasonal forecasting skill in machine learning methods that are trained on large climate model ensembles can compete with, or out-compete, existing dynamical models, while retaining physical interpretability.},

To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists.

We show that three distinct periods are identifiable in climate models, observations and reconstructions during the twentieth century. In recent decades (1981 to present), the signal of greenhouse gas forcing is present but not yet detectable at high confidence. Observations and reconstructions differ significantly from an expected pattern of greenhouse gas forcing around mid-century (1950–1975), coinciding with a global increase in aerosol forcing. In the first half of the century (1900–1949), however, a signal of greenhouse-gas-forced change is robustly detectable. Multiple observational datasets and reconstructions using data from tree rings confirm that human activities were probably affecting the worldwide risk of droughts as early as the beginning of the twentieth century.},

roles of remote and local forcing in the evolutions
of the extreme U.S. summer heat wave-drought cases
of 1980 and 1988. At early stages, both events are
associated with anomalous stationary wave
patterns. Wave activity flux analyses suggest that
in the 1980 case anomalous wave activity propagates
southeastward from an apparent source region to the
south of the Aleutians. The flux pattern is more
complex in the 1988 case but suggests two possible
source regions, one over the central North Pacific
to the north of the Hawaiian Islands and a second
located over the far western Pacific. The 1988
analyses show no anomalous wave propagation out of
the eastern tropical Pacific, although this result
does not necessarily preclude a role for tropical
forcing in generating the anomalous wave train. In
both cases the anomalous wave trains and associated
wave activity fluxes become very weak by early July,
indicating that remotely forced anomalous stationary
waves are unlikely to account for the later stages
of the heat wave-droughts. This leads us to examine
whether these events were enhanced or prolonged by
changes in the local surface energy budget
associated with reductions in evapotranspiration
(ET) over the drought regions, Water vapor budgets
show a systematic decrease in monthly mean ET from
June to August during both events. Comparisons with
nondrought summers support the idea that by late
summer ET rates in both events are anomalously
low. Estimated reductions in surface latent heat
fluxes relative to the control years are
approximately 50 W m(-2) in 1980 and 20 W m(-2) in
1988, with implied increases in sensible heating of
similar magnitudes. Overall, the results indicate
the importance of both dynamical forcing from remote
sources and anomalous local boundary conditions in
accounting for the two extreme heat wave-drought
events. The relative importance of these factors
varies significantly during the evolution of the
events, with remote forcing playing a predominant
role at early stages and anomalous local boundary
conditions assuming increasing importance at later

A regional barotropic atmospheric process over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in summer (June–August), featuring either a year-to-year change or a low-frequency trend toward geopotential height rise, has been identified as an essential contributor to September sea ice loss, in both observations and the CESM1 Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) of simulations. This local melting is further found to be sensitive to remote sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean. Here, we utilize five available large ‘‘initial condition'' Earth system model ensembles and 31 CMIP5 models' preindustrial control simulations to show that the same atmospheric process, resembling the observed one and the one found in the CESM-LE, also dominates internal sea ice variability in summer on interannual to interdecadal time scales in preindustrial, historical, and future scenarios, regardless of the modeling environment. However, all models exhibit limitations in replicating the magnitude of the observed local atmosphere–sea ice coupling and its sensitivity to remote tropical SST variability in the past four decades. These biases call for caution in the interpretation of existing models' simulations and fresh thinking about models' credibility in simulating interactions of sea ice variability with the Arctic and global climate systems. Further efforts toward identifying the causes of these model limitations may provide implications for alleviating the biases and improving interannual- and decadal-time-scale sea ice prediction and future sea ice projection.},

abstract = {The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a
climate-forcing mechanism that has been shown to
affect precipitation and the occurrence of wildfires
in many parts of the world. In the southern United
States and northern Mexico, warm events (El Nino)
are associated with moist winter conditions and
fewer fires, while cool events (La Nina) tend to
favor dry winters and more fires. We tested this
relationship in a region of northeastern Mexico by
characterizing the historical fire regime and
climatic influences. Fire regimes were reconstructed
from fire-scar samples collected from 100 trees in
three high-elevation sites on Pena Nevada in
southern Nuevo Leon. The sites were similar to 25 ha
each, and the site centers were similar to 1 km
apart. The earliest recorded fire occurred in 1521
and the time period we used for analysis was
1645-1929. The sites were characterized by frequent
surface fires before the 1920s. In the three sites,
mean fire intervals ranged from 8.6 to 9.6 years
(all fires) and 11.9 to 18.6 years (fires that
scarred {\textgreater}= 25{\%} of recording trees). The per-tree
mean fire return interval was 17 years, and all
three sites burned in the same year seven times
between 1774 and 1929. After 1929, fires were nearly
eliminated in all sites, likely due to human
causes. We found a temporal change in the
association between ENSO events and fires; before
the 1830s La Nina events were significantly
associated with fire years, while after the 1830s
this association was not significant. In 1998, when
the most severe El Nino event of the past century
occurred, the three sites experienced severe,
stand-replacing fires that killed many trees that
had survived multiple surface fires in the
past. Prior to the 1830s, fires tended to occur
during dry La Nina years, but since then both La
Nina and El Nino have been associated with dry years
in this region, especially during the last three
decades. This result suggests that ENSO effects have
changed over time in this location and that phases
of ENSO are not consistent indicators of
precipitation, fire occurrence, or fire behavior in
this area of northeastern Mexico.},

In the absence of external cooling influences, such as volcanic eruptions, temperature projections are centered on a breaching of the 1.5°C target, relative to 1850–1900, before 2029. The phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) will regulate the rate at which mean temperature approaches the 1.5°C level. A transition to the positive phase of the IPO would lead to a projected exceedance of the target centered around 2026. If the Pacific Ocean remains in its negative decadal phase, the target will be reached around 5 years later, in 2031. Given the temporary slowdown in global warming between 2000 and 2014, and recent initialized decadal predictions suggestive of a turnaround in the IPO, a sustained period of rapid temperature rise might be underway. In that case, the world will reach the 1.5°C level of warming several years sooner than if the negative IPO phase persists.},

abstract = {This paper deals primarily with the 1988 summer
drought over much of the contiguous United States
and its generation from conditions during the
preceding spring. Both the spring and summer
environment are described in terms of hemispheric
flow patterns in midtroposphere, temperature and
precipitation anomalies, and sea surface temperature
anomalies. Conditions in March were especially
indicative of the ensuing drought, since a model
routinely employed in long-range forecasting showed
that the March circulation would most likely be
followed by a hot dry April, May, and June over much
of the nation-a pattern which persisted into early
summer. This result suggests that the initiation of
the drought was rooted in extratropical climate
variations, an alternative hypothesis to one which
attributes the persistent drought-producing
circulation to oceanic and atmospheric conditions in
the tropics. In many respects the summer drought of
1988 was similar to earlier great droughts of the
Great Plains, although it was spatially more
extensive. Attempts by three forecast groups to
predict the summer conditions from spring's were
moderately successful, though none of these
anticipated the drought's severity and extent. The
underlying reasons for the summer forecast made by
the author are verified using objective tools.
Premonitory signs showed up in antecedent seasons
when deficient precipitation occurred, when
climatological contingencies provided alerts, and
when extratropical sea surface temperature patterns
evolved in a conducive manner. A new modified
barotropic model iterating from the May
midtropospheric height pattern using a mean summer
estimate of seasonal forcing produces a reasonably
successful estimate of the summer circulation and,
in retrospect, even more so when initialized from
the March height pattern for the April, May, and
June period of inception.},

of the Southern Oscillation changed from 1882 to
1995 was given by Trenberth and Hoar [1996], with a
focus on the unusual nature of the 1990-1995 El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) warm event in the
context of an observed trend for more EI Nino and
fewer La Nina events after the late 1970s. The
conclusions of that study have been challenged by
two studies which deal with only the part of our
results pertaining to the length of runs of
anomalies of one sign in the Southern Oscillation
Index. They therefore neglect the essence of
Trenberth and Hear, which focussed on the magnitude
of anomalies for certain periods and showed that
anomalies during both the post-1976 and
1990-mid-1995 periods were highly unlikely given the
previous record. With updated data through mid 1997,
we have performed additional tests using a
regression model with autoregressive-moving average
(ARMA) errors that simultaneously estimates the
appropriate ARMA model to fit the data and assesses
the statistical significance of how unusual the two
periods of interest are. The mean SOI for the
post-1976 period is statistically different from the
overall mean at {\textless} 0.05{\%} and so is the 1990-mid-1995

new El Nino event underway in 1997, reinforces the
evidence that the tendency for more El Nino and
fewer La Nina events since the late 1970s is highly
unusual and very unlikely to be accounted for solely

abstract = {Using an energy budget approach to understanding decadal temperature trends, this study highlights that observational uncertainty exceeds energy–flux deviations that affect such trends. Thus the origin of recent warming slowdown is unidentifiable. During the first decade of the twenty-first century, the Earth's surface warmed more slowly than climate models simulated1. This surface-warming hiatus is attributed by some studies to model errors in external forcing2,3,4, while others point to heat rearrangements in the ocean5,6,7,8,9,10 caused by internal variability, the timing of which cannot be predicted by the models1. However, observational analyses disagree about which ocean region is responsible11,12,13,14,15,16. Here we show that the hiatus could also have been caused by internal variability in the top-of-atmosphere energy imbalance. Energy budgeting for the ocean surface layer over a 100-member historical ensemble reveals that hiatuses are caused by energy-flux deviations as small as 0.08 W m−2, which can originate at the top of the atmosphere, in the ocean, or both. Budgeting with existing observations cannot constrain the origin of the recent hiatus, because the uncertainty in observations dwarfs the small flux deviations that could cause a hiatus. The sensitivity of these flux deviations to the observational dataset and to energy budget choices helps explain why previous studies conflict, and suggests that the origin of the recent hiatus may never be identified.},

abstract = {Global warming has stalled since the late 1990s, puzzling researchers; here a climate model that includes observed sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific reproduces the hiatus as part of natural variation, suggesting that long-term global warming is likely to continue. Global warming has largely stalled since the late 1990s, raising concerns regarding our understanding of climate sensitivity, the underlying mechanisms influencing climate variability and the ability of climate models to represent decadal variability. Yu Kosaka and Shang-Ping Xie show that the warming hiatus, including most of its seasonal and spatial aspects, can be resolved when observations of recently observed cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific are directly incorporated into a climate model. The results suggest that the current hiatus is a normal instance of internal climate variability, and that long-term warming is likely to resume as greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase. Despite the continued increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, the annual-mean global temperature has not risen in the twenty-first century1,2, challenging the prevailing view that anthropogenic forcing causes climate warming. Various mechanisms have been proposed for this hiatus in global warming3,4,5,6, but their relative importance has not been quantified, hampering observational estimates of climate sensitivity. Here we show that accounting for recent cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific reconciles climate simulations and observations. We present a novel method of uncovering mechanisms for global temperature change by prescribing, in addition to radiative forcing, the observed history of sea surface temperature over the central to eastern tropical Pacific in a climate model. Although the surface temperature prescription is limited to only 8.2{\%} of the global surface, our model reproduces the annual-mean global temperature remarkably well with correlation coefficient r = 0.97 for 1970–2012 (which includes the current hiatus and a period of accelerated global warming). Moreover, our simulation captures major seasonal and regional characteristics of the hiatus, including the intensified Walker circulation, the winter cooling in northwestern North America and the prolonged drought in the southern USA. Our results show that the current hiatus is part of natural climate variability, tied specifically to a La-Ni{\~{n}}a-like decadal cooling. Although similar decadal hiatus events may occur in the future, the multi-decadal warming trend is very likely to continue with greenhouse gas increase.},

sample sites to represent different climatic zones
and vegetation types in northern China. The mixed
data set consists of occurrence dates of all
observed phenophases for 50-70 kinds of trees and
shrubs from 1983 to 1988. Using these data, we
calculated the cumulative frequency of phenophases
in every 5-day period (pentad) throughout each year,
and also drew the cumulative frequency distribution
curve for all station-years, in order to reveal the
typical seasonal characteristics of these plant
communities. The growing season was set as the time
interval between 5{\%} and 95{\%} of the phenological
cumulative frequency. Average lengths of the growing
season varied between 188 days in the northern, to
259 days in the southern part of the research

growing season were then applied each year as time
thresholds, to determine the corresponding 10-day
peak greenness values from normalized difference

the phenological stations. Our results show that, at
the beginning of the growing season, the largest
average greenness value occurs in the southern part,
then in the northern, and finally the middle part of
the research region. In contrast, at the end of the
growing season, the largest average greenness value
is measured in the northern part, next in the middle

one of the most prominent summertime climate
patterns in South America, featuring a strong
seasonal variability in a region lying between the
Amazon and the La Plata Basin. Much of the recent
progress is derived from complementary international
programs, such as the Monsoon Experiment South
America (MESA), as well as from ongoing
international programs such as the Large Scale
Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in the Amazon Basin
(LBA) and the La Plata Basin (LPB) Regional
Hydroclimate Project, which includes the CLARIS LPB
Europe-South America Network for Climate Change
Assessment and Impact Studies in La Plata Basin
Project. The latter assesses atmosphere-land surface
interactions, the role of land use changes and
aerosols from biomass burning considered as sources
of variability and change in the SAMS functioning,
characteristics and behaviour. The SAMS region is
particularly susceptible to variations of climate
due to the importance of hydroelectricity generation
and the agricultural base of local economies. Also
addressed in this report are projections of climate
change and extremes, which are important for impact
and vulnerability assessments. This discussion
includes the need to identify and understand
important processes that control the monsoonal
climate, how these processes may vary and change,
and how they may interact with key societal sectors,
including water resource management, hydroelectric
generation, agriculture, and agribusiness. This

the knowledge of characteristics, functioning and

abstract = {The response of the tropical Pacific Ocean to future
climate change remains highly uncertain, in part
because of the disagreement among observations and
coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) regarding
20th-century trends. Here we use forward models of
climate proxies to compare CGCM simulations and
proxy observations to address 20th-century trends
and assess remaining uncertainties in both proxies
and models. We model coral oxygen isotopic
composition (delta O-18) in a 23-site Indo-Pacific
network as a linear function of sea-surface
temperature (SST) and sea-surface salinity (SSS)
obtained from historical marine observations
(instrumental data) and a multimodel ensemble of
20th-century CGCM output. When driven with
instrumental data from 1958 to 1990, the forward
modeled corals (pseudocorals) capture the spatial
pattern and temporal evolution of the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Comparison of the
linear trend observed in corals and instrumental
pseudocorals suggests that the trend in corals
between 1958 and 1990 results from both warming
(60{\%}) and freshening (40{\%}). From 1890 to 1990, the
warming/freshening trend in CGCM pseudocorals is
weaker than that observed in corals. Corals display
a moderate trend towards a reduced zonal SST
gradient and decreased ENSO-related variance between
1895 and 1985, whereas CGCM pseudocorals display a
range of trend patterns and an increase in
ENSO-related variance over the same
period. Differences between corals and CGCM
pseudocorals may arise from uncertainties in the
linear bivariate coral model, uncertainties in the
way corals record climate, undersensitivity of CGCMs
to radiative forcing during the 20th century, and/or
biases in the simulated CGCM SSS fields. Citation:

abstract = {The influence of realistic Arctic sea ice anomalies on the atmosphere during winter is investigated with version 3.6 of the Community Climate Model (CCM3.6). Model experiments are performed for the winters with the most (1982/83) and least (1995/96) Arctic ice coverage during 1979-99, when ice concentration estimates were available from satellites. The experiments consist of 50-member ensembles: using large ensembles proved critical to distinguish the signal from noise. The local response to ice anomalies over the subpolar seas of both the Atlantic and Pacific is robust and generally shallow with large upward surface heat fluxes ({\textgreater}100 W m-2), near-surface warming, enhanced precipitation, and below-normal sea level pressure where sea ice receded, and the reverse where the ice expanded. The large-scale response to reduced (enhanced) ice extent to the east (west) of Greenland during 1982/83 resembles the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) with a ridge over the poles and a trough at midlatitudes. The large-scale response was distinctly different in the Pacific, where ice extent anomalies in the Sea of Okhotsk generate a wave train that extends downstream over North America but the wave train response is greatly diminished when the model is driven by ice concentration rather than ice extent anomalies. Comparing the AGCM response to observations suggests that the feedback of the ice upon the atmospheric circulation is positive (negative) in the Pacific (Atlantic) sector. The magnitude of the wintertime response to ice extent anomalies is modest, on the order of 20 m at 500 mb. However, the 500-mb height anomalies roughly double in strength over much of the Arctic when forced by ice concetration anomalies. Furthermore, the NAO-like response increases linearly with the aerial extent of the Atlantic ice anomalies and thus could be quite large if the ice edge retreats as a result of global warming. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {T he human impact on greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and the effects on the climate system have been documented and explained by a vast resource of scientific publications, and the conclusion-that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions need to be drastically reduced within a few decades to avoid a climate catastrophe-is accepted by more than 97{\%} of the Earth-system science community today 1. The pressure to provide skillful predictions of extremes in a changing climate, for example, the number and intensity of tropical cyclones and the likelihood of heatwaves and drought co-occurrence, is particularly high because the present-day impact of natural hazards at a global level is staggering. In the period 1998-2017, over 1 million fatalities and several trillion dollars in economic loss have occurred 2. The years between 2010 and 2019 have been the costliest decade on record with the economic damage reaching US{\$}2.98 trillion-US{\$}1.19 trillion higher than 2000-2009 3. Both extreme weather and the potential failure to act on climate change rank as the leading risks combining maximum likelihood and impact for our future 4. These losses do not invalidate the steady progress achieved in weather prediction over the past decades, that is, the combined result of improved observing systems, a better understanding of the relevant physical processes occurring and interacting in the Earth system and the exponential growth of general-purpose computing technology performance at nearly constant cost 5. However, continuing at this pace is being questioned right now for two major reasons. First, the apparent effects of climate change on our environment-in particular on the frequency of occurrence and the intensity of environmental extremes-require urgent political response and much faster progress in delivering skillful predictions of future change 6,7. Earth-system models need more than steady progress and make a leap to very high resolution, a more realistic representation of processes at all scales and their interaction between atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, land surfaces and the biosphere. This leap will inevitably translate into a leap in our computational and data handling capacity needs. Second, the explosion of data challenges 8 and the demise of the 'laws' of Dennard and Moore 9 require a rethinking of the way we approach Earth-system modeling and high-performance computing (HPC) at extreme scales. These laws have been driving the development of microchips for decades. Dennard scaling states that shrinking feature sizes of transistors also decreases their power consumption such that the frequency could be increased from processor generation to the next while the heat dissipation per chip area remained approximately constant. Dennard scaling ended nearly 15 years ago and led to the 'multicore crisis' and the advent of commodity parallel processing. Moore's law drove the economics of computing by stating that every 18 months, the number of transistors on a chip would double at approximately equal cost. However, the cost per transistor starts to grow with the latest chip generations , indicating an end of this law. Therefore, in order to increase the performance while keeping the cost constant, transistors need to be used more efficiently. In this Perspective, we will present potential solutions to adapt our current algorithmic framework to best exploit what new digital technologies have to offer, thus paving the way to address the afore-mentioned challenges. In addition, we will propose the concept of a generic, scalable and performant prediction system architecture that allows advancement of our weather and climate prediction capabilities to the required levels. Powerful machine learning tools can accelerate progress in nearly all parts of this concept. The perfect application for extreme computing Weather prediction has been a pioneering application of numerical computer simulations since John von Neuman's 'Meteorology Project' in the late 1940s 10,11. Much has been achieved since then and today's operational global predictions are completed within an hour for models with about 10 million grid points, 100 vertical layers and 10 prognostic variables, initialized using 100 million observations per day. These calculations run on hundreds of nodes of general-purpose central processing units (CPU) offered by vendors in the US, Asia and Europe. The need to run simulation ensembles for predicting both state and uncertainty 12 multiplies both compute and data burden-but has proven hugely beneficial for decision-making 13. Figure 1 illustrates the elements of an operational weather prediction workflow, in which steps 2-4 are very compute-(peta-flops) and data-(100 terabytes per day) intensive. Weather simulations are different from climate simulations as they are run in burst mode at given times per day while climate predictions are run in steady-production mode to complete multi-decadal, centennial and millennial projections of the climate. Given the computational constraints, weather and climate models have diverged in the past decades: climate models need to represent closed and stable energy, water and constituent cycles at the expense of small-scale process detail; weather models, on the other hand, need this level of detail for locally accurate forecasts, but choose to exclude those Earth-system processes that are less relevant for weather on day-to-season time scales. For example, the accurate description of water-cycle processes is highly relevant for Computational science is crucial for delivering reliable weather and climate predictions. However, despite decades of high-performance computing experience, there is serious concern about the sustainability of this application in the post-Moore/ Dennard era. Here, we discuss the present limitations in the field and propose the design of a novel infrastructure that is scal-able and more adaptable to future, yet unknown computing architectures.},

This study examines the vertical profile and seasonality of observed tropospheric warming, and addresses its causes using atmospheric general circulation model simulations. The simulations enable the isolation and quantification of the role of three controlling factors of Arctic warming: 1) observed Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) changes; 2) observed remote SST changes; and 3) direct radiative forcing (DRF) due to observed changes in greenhouse gases, ozone, aerosols, and solar output. Local SIC and SST changes explain a large portion of the observed Arctic near-surface warming, whereas remote SST changes explain the majority of observed warming aloft.

abstract = {Identifying, detecting, and localizing extreme weather events is a crucial first step in understanding how they may vary under different climate change scenarios. Pattern recognition tasks such as classification, object detection , and segmentation (i.e., pixel-level classification) have remained challenging problems in the weather and climate sciences. While there exist many empirical heuristics for detecting extreme events, the disparities between the output of these different methods even for a single event are large and often difficult to reconcile. Given the success of deep learning (DL) in tackling similar problems in computer vision, we advocate a DL-based approach. DL, however, works best in the context of supervised learning-when labeled datasets are readily available. Reliable labeled training data for extreme weather and climate events is scarce. We create "ClimateNet"-an open, community-sourced human-expert-labeled curated dataset that captures tropical cyclones (TCs) and atmospheric rivers (ARs) in high-resolution climate model output from a simulation of a recent historical period. We use the curated ClimateNet dataset to train a state-of-the-art DL model for pixel-level identification -i.e., segmentation-of TCs and ARs. We then apply the trained DL model to historical and climate change scenarios simulated by the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM5.1) and show that the DL model accurately segments the data into TCs, ARs, or "the background" at a pixel level. Further, we show how the segmentation results can be used to conduct spatially and temporally precise analytics by quantifying distributions of extreme precipitation conditioned on event types (TC or AR) at regional scales. The key contribution of this work is that it paves the way for DL-based automated , high-fidelity, and highly precise analytics of climate data using a curated expert-labeled dataset-ClimateNet. ClimateNet and the DL-based segmentation method provide several unique capabilities: (i) they can be used to calculate a variety of TC and AR statistics at a fine-grained level; (ii) they can be applied to different climate scenarios and different datasets without tuning as they do not rely on threshold conditions; and (iii) the proposed DL method is suitable for rapidly analyzing large amounts of climate model output.

abstract = {The precise mechanisms driving Arctic amplification are still under debate. Previous attribution methods compute the vertically uniform temperature change required to balance the top-of-atmosphere energy imbalance caused by each forcing and feedback, with any departures from vertically uniform warming collected into the lapse-rate feedback. We propose an alternative attribution method using a single-column model that accounts for the forcing dependence of high-latitude lapse-rate changes. We examine this method in an idealized general circulation model (GCM), finding that, even though the column-integrated carbon dioxide (CO2) forcing and water vapor feedback are stronger in the tropics, they contribute to polar-amplified surface warming as they produce bottom-heavy warming in high latitudes. A separation of atmospheric temperature changes into local and remote contributors shows that, in the absence of polar surface forcing (e.g., sea ice retreat), changes in energy transport are primarily responsible for the polar-amplified pattern of warming. The addition of surface forcing substantially increases polar surface warming and reduces the contribution of atmospheric dry static energy transport to the warming. This physically based attribution method can be applied to comprehensive GCMs to provide a clearer view of the mechanisms behind Arctic amplification.},

abstract = {A strategy using statistically optimal fingerprints to detect anthropogenic climate change is outlined and applied to near-surface temperature trends. The components of this strategy include observations, information about natural climate variability, and a "guess pattern" representing the expected time-space pattern of anthropogenic climate change. The expected anthropogenic climate change is identified through projection of the observations onto an appropriate optimal fingerprint, yielding a scalar-detection variable. The statistically optimal fingerprint is obtained by weighting the components of the guess pattern (truncated to some small-dimensional space) toward low-noise directions. The null hypothesis that the observed climate change is part of natural climate variability is then tested. This strategy is applied to detecting a greenhouse-gas-induced climate change in the spatial pattern of nearsurface temperature trends defined for time intervals of 15-30 years. The expected pattern of climate change is derived from a transient simulation with a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model. Global gridded near-surface temperature observations are used to represent the observed climate change. Information on the natural variability needed to establish the statistics of the detection variable is extracted from long control simulations of coupled ocean-atmosphere models and, additionally, from the observations themselves (from which an estimated greenhouse warming signal has been removed). While the model control simulations contain only variability caused by the internal dynamics of the atmosphere-ocean system, the observations additionally contain the response to various external forcings (e.g., volcanic eruptions, changes in solar radiation, and residual anthropogenic forcing). The resulting estimate of climate noise has large uncertainties but is qualitatively the best the authors can presently offer. The null hypothesis that the latest observed 20-yr and 30-yr trend of near-surface temperature (ending in 1994) is part of natural variability is rejected with a risk of less than 2.5{\%} to 5{\%} (the 5{\%} level is derived from the variability of one model control simulation dominated by a questionable extreme event ). In other words, the probability that the warming is due to our estimated natural variability is less than 2.5{\%} to 5{\%}. The increase in the signal-to-noise ratio by optimization of the fingerprint is of the order of 10{\%}-30{\%} in most cases. The predicted signals are dominated by the global mean component; the pattern correlation excluding the global mean is positive but not very high. Both the evolution of the detection variable and also the pattern correlation results are consistent with the model prediction for greenhouse-gas-induced climate change. However, in order to attribute the observed warming uniquely to anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing, more information on the climate's response to other forcing mechanisms (e.g., changes in solar radiation, volcanic, or anthropogenic sulfate aerosols) and their interaction is needed. It is concluded that a statistically significant externally induced warming has been observed, but our caveat that the estimate of the internal climate variability is still uncertain is emphasized.},

abstract = {Progress toward understanding the causes of and
physical mechanisms involved in the 1988 North
American drought is reported. An earlier study
demonstrated that major sea surface temperature
(SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean, in
association with the 1988 La Nina, may have
disrupted atmospheric heating patterns by changing
the location and intensity of the intertropical
convergence zone and that such heating anomalies
could have initiated the circulation anomalies
across North America responsible for the drought. A
key issue of when the drought circulation anomalies
developed and their relation to changes in tropical
Pacific SSTs is examined. Although unusually dry
soil moisture and heat waves persisted into August,
the anomalous atmospheric conditions that brought on
the drought occurred in April, May, and June of
1988. The evolution of the Pacific SSTs and
tropical convection, as revealed by outgoing
longwave radiation, is shown to be consistent with
the development of the conditions favorable for
initiating the drought circulation pattern in April
through June of 1988. On the equator at
110-degrees-W, SST anomalies exceeded
-2.75-degrees-C in only April, May, and June and
were largest (-4.1-degrees-C) in May 1988. The
issues of how the 1988 La Nina differed from those
in the past and the importance of the whole SST
field in determining the anomalous diabatic heating
are also discussed. Diagnostic calculations of
atmospheric diabatic heating confirm that
atmospheric heating anomalies existed in the
tropical Pacific in association with the major SST
anomalies during this time. The link between the
anomalous heating and the tropical SSTs supports the
view that influences external to the atmosphere were
important and that the drought was not generated
solely by mechanisms internal to the atmosphere.
The distribution of diagnosed heating anomalies over
North America, together with a planetary wave model
response to idealized forcing, is described to
clarify the possible role of soil moisture anomalies
in perpetuating the drought. It is argued that
feedback-caused soil moisture anomalies may have
been secondary sources for the drought circulation
but could not have been the primary instigator. For

abstract = {This paper reviews recent progress in understanding of the North Pacific Meridional Mode (NPMM) and its influence on the timing, magnitude, flavor, and intensity of the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The NPMM is a seasonally evolving mode of coupled climate variability and features several distinct opportunities to influence ENSO. They include: (1) A Wind-Evaporation-SST (WES) feedback-driven propagation of surface anomalies onto the equator during boreal spring, (2) Trade Wind Charging (TWC) of equatorial subsurface heat content by NPMM-related surface wind stress curl anomalies in boreal winter and early spring, (3) The reflection of NPMM-forced ocean Rossby waves off the western boundary in boreal summer, and (4) A Gill-like atmospheric response associated with anomalous deep convection in boreal summer and fall. The South Pacific Meridional Mode (SPMM) also significantly modulates ENSO, and its interactions with the NPMM may contribute to ENSO diversity. Together, the NPMM and SPMM are also important components of Tropical Pacific Decadal Variability; however, future research is needed to improve understanding on these timescales. Since 1950, the boreal spring NPMM skillfully predicts about 15–30{\%} of observed winter ENSO variability. Improving simulated NPMM-ENSO relationships in forecast models may reduce ENSO forecasting error. Recent studies have begun to explore the influence of anthropogenic climate change on the NPMM-ENSO relationship; however, the results are inconclusive.},

abstract = {Precipitation over the southwestern United States
exhibits distinctive seasonality, and contrasting
ocean atmospheric dynamics are involved in the
interannual variability of cool- and warm-season
totals. Tree-ring chronologies based on annual-ring
widths of conifers in the southwestern United States
are well correlated with accumulated precipitation
and have previously been used to reconstruct cool-
season and annual precipitation totals. However,
annual-ring-width chronologies cannot typically be
used to derive a specific record of summer
monsoon-season precipitation. Some southwestern
conifers exhibit a clear anatomical transition from
the earlywood and latewood components of the annual
ring, and these exactly dated sub-annual ring
components can be measured separately and used as
unique proxies of cool- and warm-season
precipitation and their associated large-scale
ocean-atmospheric dynamics. Two 2139-yr-long
reconstructions of cool-(November-May) and
early-warm season (July) precipitation have been
developed from ancient conifers and relict wood at
El Malpais National Monument, New Mexico. Both
reconstructions have been verified on independent
precipitation data and reproduce the spatial
correlation patterns detected in the large-scale SST
and 500-mb height fields using instrumental
precipitation data from New Mexico. Above-average
precipitation in the cool- season reconstruction is
related to El Nino conditions and to the positive
phase of the Pacific decadal
oscillation. Above-average precipitation in July is
related to the onset of the North American monsoon
over New Mexico and with anomalies in the 500-mb
height field favoring moisture advection into the
Southwest from the North Pacific, the Gulf of
California, and the Gulf of Mexico. Cool- and
warm-season precipitation totals are not correlated
on an interannual basis in the 74-yr instrumental or
2139-yr reconstructed records, but wet winter-spring
extremes tend to be followed by dry conditions in
July and very dry winters tend to be followed by wet
Julys in the reconstructions. This antiphasing of
extremes could arise from the hypothesized cool- to
early-warm-season change in the sign of large-scale
ocean atmospheric forcing of southwestern
precipitation, from the negative land surface
feedback hypothesis in which winter-spring
precipitation and snow cover reduce surface warming
and delay the onset of the monsoon, or perhaps from
an interaction of both large-scale and regional
forcing. Episodes of simultaneous interseasonal
drought ("perfect'' interseasonal drought) persisted
for a decade or more during the 1950s drought of the
instrumental era and during the eighth- and
sixteenth-century droughts, which appear to have
been two of the most profound droughts over the
Southwest in the past 1400 yr. Simultaneous
interseasonal drought is doubly detrimental to
dry-land crop yields and is estimated to have
occurred during the mid-seventeenth-century famines
of colonial New Mexico but was less frequent during
the late-thirteenth-century Great Drought among the
Anasazi, which was most severe during the cool
season.},

Logistic regression analysis of the de-partures in the overall time period identified variability in evacuation timing, primarily dependent on prior experience, receipt of an evacuation order, and talking with others about the evacuation order. However, using four logistic regressions to analyze differences in departure times by day shows that the only significant variable across the three main days of evacuation was our proxy variable for evacuation-order times. Depending on the day, other variables of interest include number of household vehicles, previous hurricane experience, and receipt of an evacuation order. Descriptive results show that many variables are considered in the decision to evacuate, but results from subsequent analyses, and respondents' comments about their ex-periences, highlight that evacuation orders are the primary triggering variable for when residents left.},

abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 °C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

The motivation for defining the PDO index on HC300 stems from the following considerations: (i) a need to accentuate lower-frequency variations in the monitoring of PDO and (ii) to take into account variations in the temperatures associated with the PDO that extend throughout the upper ocean (and are modulated by the seasonal cycle of mixed layer variability). It is demonstrated that an HC300-based definition is better suited to encapsulate these characteristics in the PDO variability. The variability in an HC300-based definition is also contrasted with the traditional definition of the PDO based on SSTs.},

abstract = {The 20th century evolution of basin-wide gradients
in surface ocean properties provides one essential
test for recent models of the interaction between
the Asian monsoon and the tropical ocean, because
various feedback mechanisms should result in
characteristic regional patterns of
variability. Although the instrumental record of
climate variability in the tropics is essentially
limited to the last few decades, the stable isotopic
composition of living corals provides an effective
means for extending the instrumental
observations. Here we present two coral isotopic
records from the Indonesian Maritime Continent, and
we use these records with other previously published
records to describe: (i) the relationship between
western Pacific and central Pacific climate
variability over the past century, with special
emphasis on the biennial band; and (ii) the strength
of the west-east 'Indian Ocean Dipole'. We find that
the amplitude of the biennial cycle in the Pacific
did not vary inversely with the strength of ENSO (El
Nino Southern Oscillation), as might be expected
from some models of monsoonal feedback on the
central Pacific. Instead, the biennial variability
was modulated on decadal timescales throughout much
of the Pacific. We also show that the zonal oxygen
isotopic gradient in the Indian Ocean coral records
was significantly correlated with central Pacific
sea surface temperature on a variety of
timescales. Thus, it is likely that this 'coral
dipole' was a product of strong ENSO-like
teleconnections over the Indian Ocean, as opposed to
being the result of unique Indian Ocean or monsoonal
dynamics. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

@article{karspeck02,
abstract = {A number of studies have attempted to explain the
cause of decadal variability in the tropical Pacific
and explore its possible link to decadal variability
in the midlatitude Pacific. To investigate some of
the current theories of Pacific decadal variability,
a linear, wind-driven model, designed to simulate
only baroclinic wave dynamics, was forced with wind
stress anomalies in the Pacific Ocean basin from
1945 through 1992. An analysis technique designed to
isolate the decadal/interdecadal scale variability
from interannual ENSO variability was performed on
the model's thermocline depth anomaly (TDA). It was
found that the temporal and spatial patterns of the
observed tropical decadal sea surface temperatures
are consistent with our modeled TDA. Furthermore,
restricting the wind forcing to within 58 of the
equator does not substantially alter the
decadal/interdecadal variability of the equatorial
region. The authors conclude that the observed
decadal variability in the low-latitude Pacific is
primarily a linear dynamical response to tropical
wind forcing and does not directly require an
oceanic link to the midlatitudes. The question of
how tropical wind anomalies are generated is not
addressed. In addition, it is shown that in model
scenarios where the wind forcing is restricted to
the western equatorial Pacific, the 1976-77 climate
shift is still clearly visible as a dominant feature
of tropical decadal variability. The temporal
decadal signal of the model-generated TDA is more
pronounced during the eastern equatorial upwelling
season (July-September) than in the boreal
winter. This is consistent with the observed
seasonal bias in tracer and SST data from the
eastern equatorial Pacific.},

abstract = {Extensive summer sea ice loss has occurred within the Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, and Laptev Seas over the last decade. Associated anomalies in sensible and latent heat fluxes in autumn have increased Arctic atmospheric precipitable water and air temperatures, with the potential to impact autumn and winter cyclone activity. To examine if a connection exists between recent Arctic sea ice loss and cyclone activity, several cyclone metrics from 60° to 90°N are analyzed. Results show that following years with less September sea ice, there is a subsequent increase in moisture availability, regional baroclinicity, and changes in vertical stability that favor cyclogenesis. However, tracking of individual cyclones indicates no coherent increase in cyclone frequency or intensity associated with sea ice loss. Furthermore, no robust northward progression of extreme cyclones is observed.},

of high rainfall, is a major feature of subtropical
Southern Hemisphere climate and contributes to and
interacts with circulation features across the
Pacific, yet its past temporal variability and
forcing remain only partially understood. Here we
compare coral oxygen isotopic (delta(18)O) series
(spanning A.D. 1997-1780 and A.D. 2001-1776) from
two genera of hermatypic corals in Fiji, located
within the SPCZ, to examine the fidelity of these
corals in recording climate change and SPCZ
interdecadal dynamics. One of these coral records is
a new 225-year subannually resolved delta(18)O
series from the massive coral Diploastrea
heliopora. Diploastrea's use in climate
reconstructions is still relatively new, but this
coral has shown encouragingly similar interannual
variability to Porites, the coral genus most
commonly used in Pacific paleoclimate studies. In
Fiji we observe that interdecadal delta(18)O
variance is also similar in these two coral genera,
and Diploastrea contains a larger-amplitude
interdecadal signal that more closely tracks
instrumental-based indices of Pacific interdecadal
climate change and the SPCZ than Porites. Both coral
delta(18)O series record greater interdecadal
variability from similar to 1880 to 1950, which is
consistent with the observations of Folland et
al. (2002), who reported higher variability in SPCZ
position before 1945. These observations indicate
that Diploastrea will likely provide a significant
new source of long-term climate information from the
SPCZ region.},

abstract = {Anew dataset of historical monthly streamflow at the
farthest downstream stations for the world's 925
largest ocean-reaching rivers has been created for
community use. Available new gauge records are added
to a network of gauges that covers similar to 80 x
10(6) km(2) or similar to 80{\%} of global
ocean-draining land areas and accounts for about
73{\%} of global total runoff. For most of the large
rivers, the record for 1948-2004 is fairly
complete. Data gaps in the records are filled
through linear regression using streamflow simulated
by a land surface model [ Community Land Model,
version 3 (CLM3)] forced with observed precipitation
and other atmospheric forcings that are
significantly ( and often strongly) correlated with
the observed streamflow for most rivers. Compared
with previous studies, the new dataset has improved
homogeneity and enables more reliable assessments of
decadal and long-term changes in continental
freshwater discharge into the oceans. The
model-simulated runoff ratio over drainage areas
with and without gauge records is used to estimate
the contribution from the areas not monitored by the
gauges in deriving the total discharge into the
global oceans. Results reveal large variations in
yearly streamflow for most of the world's large
rivers and for continental discharge, but only about
one-third of the top 200 rivers ( including the
Congo, Mississippi, Yenisey, Parana, Ganges,
Columbia, Uruguay, and Niger) show statistically
significant trends during 1948-2004, with the rivers
having downward trends ( 45) outnumbering those with
upward trends ( 19). The interannual variations are
correlated with the El Nino-SouthernnOscillation
(ENSO) events for discharge into the Atlantic,
Pacific, Indian, and global ocean as a whole. For
ocean basins other than the Arctic, and for the
global ocean as a whole, the discharge data show
small or downward trends, which are statistically
significant for the Pacific (-9.4 km(3)
yr(-1)). Precipitation is a major driver for the
discharge trends and large interannual-to-decadal
variations. Comparisons with the CLM3 simulation
suggest that direct human influence on annual
streamflow is likely small compared with climatic
forcing during 1948-2004 for most of the world's
major rivers. For the Arctic drainage areas, upward
trends in streamflow are not accompanied by
increasing precipitation, especially over Siberia,
based on available data, although recent surface
warming and associated downward trends in snow cover
and soil ice content over the northern high
latitudes contribute to increased runoff in these
regions. The results are qualitatively consistent
with climate model projections but contradict an
earlier report of increasing continental runoff
during the recent decades based on limited records.},

historical reconstruction of each emitted compound,
for each region and sector, is then forced to agree
with our 2000 estimate, ensuring continuity between
past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two
chemistry-climate models are used to test the
ability of the emission dataset described here to
capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone,
carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The
simulated long-term change in the Northern
mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is
not quite as rapid as observed. However, stations
outside this latitude band show much better
agreement in both present-day and long-term

concentration of carbon monoxide is underestimated
at the Mace Head station; however, the long-term
trend over the limited observational period seems to
be reasonably well captured. The simulated sulfate

very good agreement with the ice-core observations
spanning the simulation period. Finally, aerosol

This evaluation framework allows us to directly attribute discrepancies between models and observations to biases in the simulated internal variability or forced response, without relying on assumptions to separate these signals in observations. The largest discrepancies result from the overestimated forced warming in some models during recent decades. In contrast, models do not systematically over-or underestimate internal variability in global mean temperature. On regional scales, all models misrepresent surface temperature variability over the Southern Ocean, while overestimating variability over land-surface areas, such as the Amazon and South Asia, and high-latitude oceans. Our evaluation shows that MPI-GE, followed by GFDL-ESM2M and CESM-LE offer the best global and regional representation of both the internal variability and forced response in observed historical temperatures.},

abstract = {It remains difficult to disentangle the relative influences of aerosols and greenhouse gases on regional surface temperature trends in the context of global climate change. To address this issue, we use a new collection of initial-condition large ensembles from the Community Earth System Model version 1 that are prescribed with different combinations of industrial aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing. To compare the climate response to these external forcings, we adopt an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture from previous work that predicts the year by training on maps of near-surface temperature. We then utilize layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize the regional temperature signals that are important for the ANN's prediction in each climate model experiment. To mask noise when extracting only the most robust climate patterns from LRP, we introduce a simple uncertainty metric that can be adopted to other explainable artificial intelligence (AI) problems. We find that the North Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and Southeast Asia are key regions of importance for the neural network to make its prediction, especially prior to the early-21st century. Notably, we also find that the ANN predictions based on maps of observations correlate higher to the actual year after training on the large ensemble experiment with industrial aerosols held fixed to 1920 levels. This work illustrates the sensitivity of regional temperature signals to changes in aerosol forcing in historical simulations. By using explainable AI methods, we have the opportunity to improve our understanding of (non)linear combinations of anthropogenic forcings in state-of-the-art global climate models.},

This algorithm identifies sudden warmings based on the zonal mean zonal wind at 60°N and 10 hPa, and classifies them into events that do and do not split the stratospheric polar vortex. Major midwinter stratospheric sudden warmings are found to occur with a frequency of approximately six events per decade, and 46{\%} of warming events lead to a splitting of the stratospheric polar vortex.

Further we show the rate of occurrence of such an extreme heat event is likely to substantially increase in the future with increasing levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases.

The atmosphere in thermal equilibrium has an isothermal lower stratosphere and an inversion in the upper stratosphere which are features observed in middle latitudes. The role of various gaseous absorbers (i.e., water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone), as well as the role of the clouds, is investigated by computing thermal equilibrium with and without one or two of these elements.

A Causal Effect Networks (CEN) framework is used to explore the stratospheric pathway between late autumn Barents-Kara sea ice and the February NAO, focusing on its seasonal 5 evolution, timescale-dependence, and robustness. Results indicate that the pathway is statistically detectable and has been relatively "active" over the 39-year observational period used here, explaining approximately 26{\%} of the interannual variability in the February NAO. However, a bootstrap-based resampling test reveals that the pathway is highly intermittent: the full strato-spheric pathway appears in only 15{\%} of the sample populations derived from observations, with individual causal linkages ranging from 44 to 85{\%} in occurrence rates. The pathway's intermittency is consistent with the weak signal-to-noise ratio of 10 the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice variability in modelling experiments, and suggests that Arctic-midlatitude telecon-nections might be favoured in certain background states. On shorter time scales, the CEN detects two-way interactions between Barents-Kara sea ice and the midlatitude circulation that indicate a role for synoptic variability associated with blocking over the Urals region and moist air intrusions from the Euro-Atlantic sector. This synoptic variability has the potential to interfere with the stratospheric pathway, thereby contributing to its intermittency. This study helps quantify the robustness of causal 15 linkages within the stratospheric pathway, and provides insight into which linkages are most subject to sampling issues within the relatively short observational record. Overall, the results should help guide the analysis and design of ensemble modelling experiments required to improve physical understanding of Arctic-midlatitude teleconnections.},

We demonstrate that artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a useful addition to the climate science “toolbox” for this purpose. Specifically, forced patterns are detected by an ANN trained on climate model simulations under historical and future climate scenarios. By identifying spatial patterns that serve as indicators of change in surface temperature and precipitation, the ANN can determine the approximate year from which the simulations came without first explicitly separating the forced signal from the noise of both internal climate variability and model uncertainty. Thus, the ANN indicator patterns are complex, nonlinear combinations of signal and noise and are identified from the 1960s onward in simulated and observed surface temperature maps. This approach suggests that viewing climate patterns through an artificial intelligence (AI) lens has the power to uncover new insights into climate variability and change.},

abstract = {Severe cold air outbreaks have significant impacts on human health, energy use, agriculture, and transportation. Anomalous behavior of the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex provides an important source of subseasonal-to-seasonal predictability of Northern Hemisphere cold air outbreaks. Here, through reanalysis data for the period 1958–2019 and climate model simulations for preindustrial conditions, we show that weak stratospheric polar vortex conditions increase the risk of severe cold air outbreaks in mid-latitude East Asia by 100{\%}, in contrast to only 40{\%} for moderate cold air outbreaks. Such a disproportionate increase is also found in Europe, with an elevated risk persisting more than three weeks. By analysing the stream of polar cold air mass, we show that the polar vortex affects severe cold air outbreaks by modifying the inter-hemispheric transport of cold air mass. Using a novel method to assess Granger causality, we show that the polar vortex provides predictive information regarding severe cold air outbreaks over multiple regions in the Northern Hemisphere, which may help with mitigating their impact. A weak stratospheric polar vortex in the Arctic leads to a disproportionally increased risk of severe cold air outbreaks over northern extratropical regions, compared to moderate outbreaks, suggest analyses of reanalysis data and climate model simulations.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine various options for the calculation of the forced signal in climate model simulations, and the impact these choices have on the estimates of internal variability. We find that an ensemble mean of runs from a single climate model [a single model ensemble mean (SMEM)] provides a good estimate of the true forced signal even for models with very few ensemble members. In cases where only a single member is available for a given model, however, the SMEM from other models is in general out-performed by the scaled ensemble mean from all available climate model simulations [the multimodel ensemble mean (MMEM)]. The scaled MMEM may therefore be used as an estimate of the forced signal for observations. The MMEM method, however, leads to increasing errors further into the future, as the different rates of warming in the models causes their trajectories to diverge. We therefore apply the SMEM method to those models with a sufficient number of ensemble members to estimate the change in the amplitude of internal variability under a future forcing scenario. In line with previous results, we find that on average the surface air temperature variability decreases at higher latitudes, particularly over the ocean along the sea ice margins, while variability in precipitation increases on average, particularly at high latitudes. Variability in sea level pressure decreases on average in the Southern Hemisphere, while in the Northern Hemisphere there are regional differences.},

In this work, we modify a dynamic crop model in order to simulate one important effect of heavy precipitation on crop growth, plant damage from excess soil moisture.

Here, an ANN is tasked with whether or not there will be a slowdown in the rate of the GMST trend by using maps of ocean heat content at the onset. Through a machine learning explainability method, we find the ANN is learning off-equatorial patterns of anomalous ocean heat content that resemble transitions in the phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in order to make slowdown predictions.

abstract = {Marine ecosystems are increasingly stressed by human-induced changes. Marine ecosystem drivers that contribute to stressing ecosystems - including warming, acidification, deoxygenation and perturbations to biological productivity - can co-occur in space and time, but detecting their trends is complicated by the presence of noise associated with natural variability in the climate system. Here we use large initial-condition ensemble simulations with an Earth system model under a historical/RCP8.5 (representative concentration pathway 8.5) scenario over 1950-2100 to consider emergence characteristics for the four individual and combined drivers. Using a 1-standard-deviation (67{\%} confidence) threshold of signal to noise to define emergence with a 30-year trend window, we show that ocean acidification emerges much earlier than other drivers, namely during the 20th century over most of the global ocean. For biological productivity, the anthropogenic signal does not emerge from the noise over most of the global ocean before the end of the 21st century. The early emergence pattern for sea surface temperature in low latitudes is reversed from that of subsurface oxygen inventories, where emergence occurs earlier in the Southern Ocean. For the combined multiple-driver field, 41{\%} of the global ocean exhibits emergence for the 2005-2014 period, and 63{\%} for the 2075-2084 period. The combined multiple-driver field reveals emergence patterns by the end of this century that are relatively high over much of the Southern Ocean, North Pacific, and Atlantic, but relatively low over the tropics and the South Pacific. For the case of two drivers, the tropics including habitats of coral reefs emerges earliest, with this driven by the joint effects of acidification and warming. It is precisely in the regions with pronounced emergence characteristics where marine ecosystems may be expected to be pushed outside of their comfort zone determined by the degree of natural background variability to which they are adapted. The results underscore the importance of sustained multi-decadal observing systems for monitoring multiple ecosystems drivers.},

Here, the influence of QBO phase on the atmospheric response to projected Arctic sea ice loss is examined using an atmospheric general circulation model with a well-resolved stratosphere and a QBO prescribed from observations. The role of the QBO is determined by compositing seasons with easterly phase (QBO-E) separately from seasons with westerly phase (QBO-W). In response to the sea ice forcing in early winter, the polar vortex during QBO-E weakens with strong stratosphere-troposphere wave-1 coupling and a negative Northern Annular Mode-type response. At the surface, this results in more severe Siberian cold spells. For QBO-W, the polar vortex strengthens in response to the sea ice forcing},

20 years. Across the conterminous USA, a readily
accessible and decade-long data set is now available
to study many aspects of vegetation activity in,this

growth at the start of the spring season (SOS) is of
special interest, as it appears to be crucial for
accurate computation of several important biospheric
processes, and a sensitive measure of the impacts of
global change. In this study, satellite-derived SOS
dates produced by the delayed moving average (DMA)

modelled surface phenology (spring indices, SI) were
compared at widespread deciduous forest and mixed
woodland sites during 1990-93 and 1995-99, and these
three measures were also matched to native species
bud-break data collected at the Harvard Forest

results show that both SOS methods are doing a
modestly accurate job of tracking the general
pattern of surface phenology, but highlight the
temporal limitations of biweekly satellite
data. Specifically, at deciduous forest sites: (1)
SMN SOS dates are close in time to SI first bloom
dates (average bias of +0.74 days), whereas DMA SOS
dates are considerably earlier (average bias of
-41.24 days) and also systematically earlier in late

contribution of bedrock carbon, both of which could
reflect decreased effective moisture. A lack of

abstract = {Dense water masses from the Barents Sea are an important part of the Arctic thermohaline system. Here, using hydrographic observations from 1971 to 2018, we show that the Barents Sea climate system has reached a point where ‘the Barents Sea cooling machine'—warmer Atlantic inflow, less sea ice, more regional ocean heat loss—has changed towards less-efficient cooling. Present change is dominated by reduced ocean heat loss over the southern Barents Sea as a result of anomalous southerly winds. The outflows have accordingly become warmer. Outflow densities have nevertheless remained relatively unperturbed as increasing salinity appears to have compensated the warming inflow. However, as the upstream Atlantic Water is now observed to freshen while still relatively warm, we speculate that the Barents Sea within a few years may export water masses of record-low density to the adjacent basins and deep ocean circulation. The Barents Sea cools the ocean, and dense water masses form that flow into the global overturning circulation. Hydrographic observations from 1971 to 2018 show reduced cooling efficiency with warmer Atlantic inflow, reduced sea ice and reduced wind-driven heat loss.},

For two to three decades starting from the mid-1980s, accelerated Arctic warming and a reduced meridional near-surface temperature gradient coincided with a wavier circulation. However, waviness remains largely unchanged in model simulations featuring strong Arctic amplification. Here, we show that the previously reported trend toward a wavier circulation during autumn and winter has reversed in recent years, despite continued Arctic amplification, resulting in negligible multidecadal trends. Models capture the observed correspondence between a reduced temperature gradient and increased waviness on interannual to decadal time scales. However, model experiments in which a reduced temperature gradient is imposed do not feature increased wave amplitude. Our results strongly suggest that the observed and simulated covariability between waviness and temperature gradients on interannual to decadal time scales does not represent a forced response to Arctic amplification.},

The extratropical QBO discussed by Holton and Tan existed in both temporal halves of the dataset. Autocorrelation analysis demonstrated that it was an important mode of interannual variability in the extratropical winter stratosphere. Correlation with the tropics was strongest when 40-mb equatorial winds were used to define the tropical QBO. Easterly phase at 40 mb implied a weaker than normal polar night jet and warmer than normal polar temperature and vice versa. An opposite relationship was obtained using 10-mb equatorial winds. The association between tropical and extra-tropical QBOs was observed in about 90{\%} of the winters and was statistically significant.

abstract = {In initialized seasonal to decadal (S2D) predictions, model hindcasts rapidly drift away from the initial observed state and converge toward a preferred state characterized by systematic error, or bias. Bias and drift are among the greatest challenges facing initialized prediction today. Differences in trends between initial states and drifted states, combined with bias and drift, introduce complexities in calculating anomalies to assess skill of initialized predictions. We examine several methods of calculating anomalies using the Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (DPLE) using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) initialized hindcasts and focus on Pacific and Atlantic SSTs to illustrate issues with anomaly calculations. Three methods of computing anomalies, one as differences from a long term model climatology, another as bias-adjusted differences from the previous 15 year average from observations, and a third as differences from the previous 15 year average from the model, are contrasted and each is shown to have limitations. For the first, trends in bias and drift introduce higher skill estimates earlier and later in the hindcast period due to the trends that contribute to skill. For the second, higher skill can be introduced in situations where low frequency variability in the observations is large compared to the hindcasts on timescales greater than 15 years, while lower skill can result if the predicted signal is small and the bias-correction itself produces a transition of SST anomalies to the opposite sign of those that are observed. The third method has somewhat lower skill compared to each of the others, but has less difficulties with not only the long term trends in the model climatology, but also with the unrealistic situational skill from using observations as a reference. However, the first 15 years of the hindcast period cannot be evaluated due to having to wait to accumulate the previous 15 year model climatology before the method can be applied. The IPO transition in the 2014–2016 time frame from negative to positive (predicted by Meehl et al. in in Nat Commun, 10.1038/NCOMMS11718, 2016) did indeed verify using all three methods, though each provides somewhat different skill values as a result of the respective limitations. There is no clear best method, as all are roughly comparable, and each has its own set of limitations and caveats. However, all three methods show generally higher overall skill in the AMO region compared to the IPO region.},

multi-decadal fluctuations that were linked to
oceanic forcing in the Atlantic. This modeling study
shows that vegetation dynamics may play a major role
in such low-frequency variability in the
Amazon. Despite the large amount of annual
precipitation, the presence of a dry season (albeit
short) facilitates a strong impact of dynamic
vegetation on precipitation persistence in the
model. The year-to-year variation of net primary
productivity (NPP) is dominated by that of the dry
season NPP. As a result, above-normal (below-normal)
precipitation in a particular year can enhance
(suppress) vegetation growth, leading to widespread
increase (decrease) of vegetation density in the
subsequent year. Precipitation in the subsequent
year is therefore more likely to be above (below)
normal. This damping effect of vegetation enhances
low-frequency variability of precipitation and leads
to recurrent droughts or floods, a result previously

This study quantifies those from the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, finding that the largest contributions are during the positive phase, which accelerates warming. Longer-term externally forced trends in global mean surface temperatures (GMSTs) are embedded in the background noise of internally generated multidecadal variability1. A key mode of internal variability is the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), which contributed to a reduced GMST trend during the early 2000s1,2,3. We use a novel, physical phenomenon-based approach to quantify the contribution from a source of internally generated multidecadal variability—the IPO—to multidecadal GMST trends. Here we show that the largest IPO contributions occurred in its positive phase during the rapid warming periods from 1910–1941 and 1971–1995, with the IPO contributing 71{\%} and 75{\%}, respectively, to the difference between the median values of the externally forced trends and observed trends. The IPO transition from positive to negative in the late-1990s contributed 27{\%} of the discrepancy between model median estimates of the forced part of the GMST trend and the observed trend from 1995 to 2013, with additional contributions that are probably due to internal variability outside of the Pacific4 and an externally forced response from small volcanic eruptions5.

abstract = {Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks, utilize multiple specialized layers to encode spatial patterns at different scales. In this study, deep learning models are compared with standard machine learning approaches on the task of predicting the probability of severe hail based on upper-air dynamic and thermodynamic fields from a convection-allowing numerical weather prediction model. The data for this study come from patches surrounding storms identified in NCAR convection-allowing ensemble runs from 3 May to 3 June 2016. The machine learning models are trained to predict whether the simulated surface hail size from the Thompson hail size diagnostic exceeds 25 mm over the hour following storm detection. A convolutional neural network is compared with logistic regressions using input variables derived from either the spatial means of each field or principal component analysis. The convolutional neural network statistically significantly outperforms all other methods in terms of Brier skill score and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. Interpretation of the convolutional neural network through feature importance and feature optimization reveals that the network synthesized information about the environment and storm morphology that is consistent with our understanding of hail growth, including large lapse rates and a wind shear profile that favors wide updrafts. Different neurons in the network also record different storm modes, and the magnitude of the output of those neurons is used to analyze the spatiotemporal distributions of different storm modes in the NCAR ensemble.},

abstract = {The leading empirical orthogonal function of the wintertime sea-level perssure field is more strongly coupled to surface air temperature fluctuations over the Eurasian continent than the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). It resembles the NAO in many respects; but its primary center of action covers more of the Arctic, giving it a more zonally symmetric appearance. Coupled to strong fluctuations at the 50-hPa level on the intraseasonal, interannual, and interdecadal time scales, this 'Arctic Oscillation' (AO) can be interpreted as the surface signature of modulations in the strength of the polar vortex aloft. It is proposed that the zonally asymmetric surface air temperature and mid-tropospheric circulation anomalies observed in association with the AO may be secondary baroclinic features induced by the land-sea contrasts. The same modal structure is mirrored in the pronounced trends in winter and springtime surface air temperature, sea-level pressure, and 50-hPa height over the past 30 years: parts of Eurasia have warmed by as much as several K, sea-level pressure over parts of the Arctic has fallen by 4 hPa, and the core of the lower stratospheric polar vortex has cooled by several K. These trends can be interpreted as the development of a systematic bias in one of the atmosphere's dominant, naturally occurring modes of variability.},

The total response is partioned into a portion that projects onto the leading mode of internal variability (the indirect response) and a portion that is the residual from that projection (the direct response). This empirical decomposition yields physically meaningful patterns whose distinctive horizontal and vertical structures imply different governing mechanisms. The indirect response, which dominates the total geopotential height response, is hemispheric in scale with resemblance to the North Atlantic Oscillation or Northern Hemisphere annular mode, and equivalent barotropic in the vertical from the surface to the tropopaus...},

abstract = {The current Southwest drought is exceptional for its
high temperatures and arguably the most severe in
history. Coincidentally, there has been an increase
in forest and woodland mortality due to fires and
pathogenic outbreaks. Although the high temperatures
and aridity are consistent with projected impacts of
greenhouse warming, it is unclear whether the
drought can be attributed to increased greenhouse
gasses or is a product of natural climatic
variability. Climate models indicate that the 21st
century will be increasingly arid and droughts more
severe and prolonged. Forest and woodland mortality
due to fires and pathogens will increase. Demography
and food security dictate that water demand in the
Southwest will remain appreciable. If projected
population growth is twinned with suburb-centered
development, domestic demands will
intensify. Meeting domestic demands through
transference from agriculture presents concerns for
rural sustainability and food
security. Environmental concerns will limit
additional transference from rivers. It is unlikely
that traditional supply-side solutions such as more
dams will securely meet demands at current
per-capita levels. Significant savings in domestic
usage can be realized through decreased applications
of potable water to landscaping, but this is a small
fraction of total regional water use, which is
dominated by agriculture. Technical innovations,
policy measures, and market-based solutions that
increase supply and decrease water demand are all
needed. Meeting 21st-century sustainability
challenges in the Southwest will also require
planning, cooperation, and integration that surpass
20th-century efforts in terms of geographic scope,
jurisdictional breadth, multisectoral engagement,

abstract = {The authors' previous dynamical study has suggested a link between the Indian and Pacific Ocean interannual climate variations through the transport variations of the Indonesian Throughflow. In this study, the consistency of this oceanic channel link with observations is investigated using correlation analyses of observed ocean temperature, sea surface height, and surface wind data. The analyses show significant lag correlations between the sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean in fall and those in the eastern Pacific cold tongue in the following summer through fall seasons, suggesting potential predictability of ENSO events beyond the period of 1 yr. The dynamics of this teleconnection seem not through the atmospheric bridge, because the wind anomalies in the far western equatorial Pacific in fall have insignificant correlations with the cold tongue anomalies at time lags beyond one season. Correlation analyses between the sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean and those over the Indo-Pacific basin suggest eastward propagation of the upwelling anomalies from the Indian Ocean into the equatorial Pacific Ocean through the Indonesian Seas. Correlations in the subsurface temperature in the equatorial vertical section of the Pacific Ocean confirm the propagation. In spite of the limitation of the short time series of observations available, the study seems to suggest that the ocean channel connection between the two basins is important for the evolution and predictability of ENSO. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Aerosols interact with radiation and clouds. Substantial progress made over the past 40 years in observing, understanding, and modeling these processes helped quantify the imbalance in the Earth's radiation budget caused by anthropogenic aerosols, called aerosol radiative forcing, but uncertainties remain large. This review provides a new range of aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial era based on multiple, traceable, and arguable lines of evidence, including modeling approaches, theoretical considerations, and observations. Improved understanding of aerosol absorption and the causes of trends in surface radiative fluxes constrain the forcing from aerosol-radiation interactions. A robust theoretical foundation and convincing evidence constrain the forcing caused by aerosol-driven increases in liquid cloud droplet number concentration. However, the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud liquid water content and cloud fraction is less clear, and the influence on mixed-phase and ice clouds remains poorly constrained. Observed changes in surface temperature and radiative fluxes provide additional constraints. These multiple lines of evidence lead to a 68{\%} confidence interval for the total aerosol effective radiative forcing of -1.6 to -0.6 W m−2, or -2.0 to -0.4 W m−2 with a 90{\%} likelihood. Those intervals are of similar width to the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment but shifted toward more negative values. The uncertainty will narrow in the future by continuing to critically combine multiple lines of evidence, especially those addressing industrial-era changes in aerosol sources and aerosol effects on liquid cloud amount and on ice clouds.},

abstract = {The El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs in three phases: neutral, warm (El Ni{\~{n}}o) and cool (La Ni{\~{n}}a). While classifying El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a is relatively straightforward, El Ni{\~{n}}o events can be broadly classified into two types: Central Pacific (CP) and Eastern Pacific (EP). Differentiating between CP and EP events is currently dependent on both the method and observational dataset used. In this study, we create a new classification scheme using supervised machine learning trained 5 on 18 observational and reanalysis products. This builds on previous work by identifying classes of events using the temporal evolution of sea surface temperature in multiple regions across the tropical Pacific. By applying this new classifier to seven single model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs) we investigate both the internal variability and forced changes in each type of ENSO event, where events identified behave similar to those observed. It is currently debated whether the observed increase in the frequency of CP events after the late 1970s is due to climate change. We found it to be within the range of 10 internal variability in the SMILEs. When considering future changes, we do not project a change in CP frequency or amplitude under a strong warming scenario (RCP8.5/SSP370) and we find model differences in EP El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a frequency and amplitude projections. Finally, we find that models show differences in projected precipitation and SST pattern changes for each event type that do not seem to be linked to the Pacific mean state SST change, although the SST and precipitation changes in individual SMILEs are linked. Our work demonstrates the value of combining machine learning with climate models, and 15 highlights the need to use SMILEs when evaluating ENSO in climate models due to the large spread of results found within a single model due to internal variability alone.},

abstract = {This article investigates the use of dynamic laboratory simulations as a tool for studying decisions to prepare for hurricane threats. A prototype web-based simulation named Stormview is described that allows individuals to experience the approach of a hurricane in a computer-based environment. In Stormview participants can gather storm information through various media, hear the opinions of neighbors, and indicate intentions to take protective action. We illustrate how the ability to exert experimental control over the information viewed by participants can be used to provide insights into decision making that would be difficult to gain from field studies, such as how preparedness decisions are affected by the nature of news coverage of prior storms, how a storm's movement is depicted in graphics, and the content of word-of-mouth communications. Data from an initial application involving a sample of Florida residents reveal a number of unexpected findings about hurricane risk response. Participants who viewed forecast graphics, which contained track lines depicting the most likely path of the storm, for example, had higher levels of preparation than those who saw graphics that showed only uncertainty cones-even among those living far from the predicted center path. Similarly, the participants who were most likely to express worry about an approaching storm and fastest to undertake preparatory action were those who, ironically, had never experienced one. Finally, external validity is evidenced by a close rank-order correspondence between patterns of information use revealed in the lab and that found in previous cross-sectional field studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract = {Core records, both ice and deep-sea, suggest that
the dominant character is that of a red-noise
process or random walk. Examination of a few typical
records supports the inference that the contribution
of the Milankovitch frequencies to climate change at
most represents only a small fraction of total
climate variance. Most spectral densities are
sufficiently ``flat{\{}''{\}} that rates of change will be
dominated by the highest frequencies present in the
forcing. A broad maximum near 100 ky period can be
readily rationalized without invoking an
oscillator. One need only suppose that there is an
approximate threshold beyond which the climate
system collapses. The quasiperiodicity is then
governed by a combination of the collapse threshold,
the system memory time scale, and the intensity of
the stochastic forcing. Changes in the forcing
intensity would lead to a shift in the dominant time
scale. Some inferred spectral power laws may be
inaccurate owing to undersampling of the records.},

As a black box model due to their multilayer nonlinear structure, Deep Neural Networks are often criticized to be non-transparent and their predictions not traceable by humans. Furthermore, the models learn from artificial datasets, often with bias or contaminated discriminating content. Through their increased distribution, decision-making algorithms can contribute promoting prejudge and unfairness which is not easy to notice due to lack of transparency. Hence, scientists developed several so-called explanators or explainers which try to point out the connection between input and output to represent in a simplified way the inner structure of machine learning black boxes. In this survey we differ the mechanisms and properties of explaining systems for Deep Neural Networks for Computer Vision tasks. We give a comprehensive overview about taxonomy of related studies and compare several survey papers that deal with explainability in general. We work out the drawbacks and gaps and summarize further research ideas.},

It is a direct measure of the total forcing of the zonal-mean state by the eddies. The direction of F indicates the relative importance of the principal eddy fluxes of heat and momentum.

abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report largely depends on simulations, predictions and projections by climate models. Most models, however, have deficiencies and biases that raise large uncertainties in their products. Over the past several decades, a tremendous effort has been made to improve model performance in the simulation of special regions and aspects of the climate system. Here we show that biases or errors in special regions can be linked with others at far away locations. We find in 22 climate models that regional sea surface temperature (SST) biases are commonly linked with the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which is characterized by the northward flow in the upper ocean and returning southward flow in the deep ocean. A simulated weak AMOC is associated with cold biases in the entire Northern Hemisphere with an atmospheric pattern that resembles the Northern Hemisphere annular mode. The AMOC weakening is also associated with a strengthening of Antarctic Bottom Water formation and warm SST biases in the Southern Ocean. It is also shown that cold biases in the tropical North Atlantic and West African/Indian monsoon regions during the warm season in the Northern Hemisphere have interhemispheric links with warm SST biases in the tropical southeastern Pacific and Atlantic, respectively. The results suggest that improving the simulation of regional processes may not suffice for overall better model performance, as the effects of remote biases may override them. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Stable water isotopes have been measured in a wide
range of climate archives, with the purpose of
reconstructing regional climate variations. Yet the
common assumption that the isotopic signal is a
direct indicator of temperature proves to be
misleading under certain circumstances, since its
relationship with temperature also depends on
e.g. atmospheric circulation and precipitation
seasonality. Here we introduce the principles,
benefits and caveats of using climate models with
embedded water isotopes as a support for the
interpretation of isotopic climate archives. A short
overview of the limitations of empirical
calibrations of isotopic proxy records is
presented. In some cases, the underlying hypotheses
are not fulfilled and the calibration contradicts
the physical interpretation of isotopic
fractionation. The simulation of climate and its
associated isotopic signal, despite difficulties
related to downscaling and intrinsic atmospheric
variability, can provide a 'transfer function'
between the isotopic signal and the considered
climate variable. The relationship between modelled
temperature and isotopic signal is analysed under
present-day, pre-industrial and mid-Holocene
conditions. The linear regression relationship is
statistically more significant for
precipitation-weighted annual temperature than mean
annual temperature, yet the regression slope varies
greatly between the time-slice
experiments. Temperature reconstructions that do not
account for the slope variations will in this case
underestimate the low-frequency variability and
overestimate high-frequency variability from the
isotopic proxy record. The spatial variability of
the simulated delta O-18-temperature slope further
indicates that the isotopic signal is primarily
controlled by synoptic atmospheric circulation
rather than local temperature.},

abstract = {The North Atlantic ocean is key to climate through its role in heat transport and storage. Climate models suggest that the circulation is weakening but the physical drivers of this change are poorly constrained. Here, the root mechanisms are revealed with the explicitly transparent machine learning (ML) method Tracking global Heating with Ocean Regimes (THOR). Addressing the fundamental question of the existence of dynamical coherent regions, THOR identifies these and their link to distinct currents and mechanisms such as the formation regions of deep water masses, and the location of the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current. Beyond a black box approach, THOR is engineered to elucidate its source of predictive skill rooted in physical understanding. A labeled data set is engineered using an explicitly interpretable equation transform and k-means application to model data, allowing theoretical inference. A multilayer perceptron is then trained, explaining its skill using a combination of layerwise relevance propagation and theory. With abrupt CO2 quadrupling, the circulation weakens due to a shift in deep water formation regions, a northward shift of the Gulf Stream and an eastward shift in the North Atlantic Current. If CO2 is increased 1{\%} yearly, similar but weaker patterns emerge influenced by natural variability. THOR is scalable and applicable to a range of models using only the ocean depth, dynamic sea level and wind stress, and could accelerate the analysis and dissemination of climate model data. THOR constitutes a step toward trustworthy ML called for within oceanography and beyond, as its predictions are physically tractable.},

exhibits a highly statistically significant
interdecadal component vet contains little to no

unrelated to interannual El Nino variability. the
interdecadal ocean-atmosphere variability still

abstract = {The development of “intelligent” systems that can take decisions and perform autonomously might lead to faster and more consistent decisions. A limiting factor for a broader adoption of AI technology is the inherent risks that come with giving up human control and oversight to “intelligent” machines. Forsensitive tasks involving critical infrastructures and affecting human well-being or health, it is crucial to limit the possibility of improper, non-robust and unsafe decisions and actions. Before deploying an AI system, we see a strong need to validate its behavior, and thus establish guarantees that it will continue toperform as expected when deployed in a real-world environment. In pursuit of that objective, ways for humans to verify the agreement between the AI decision structure and their own ground-truth knowledge have been explored. Explainable AI (XAI) has developed as a subfield of AI, focused on exposing complex AI models to humans in a systematic and interpretable manner. The 22 chapters included in this book provide a timely snapshot of algorithms, theory, and applications ofinterpretable and explainable AI and AI techniques that have been proposed recently reflecting the current discourse in this field and providing directions of future development.

Since 1988 the thickness of the simulated basinwide ice thinned by 1.31 m or 43{\%}. The thinning is greatest along the coast in the sector from the Chukchi Sea to the Beaufort Sea to Greenland. It is hypothesized that the thinning since 1988 is due to preconditioning, a trigger, and positive feedbacks: 1) the fall, winter, and spring air temperatures over the Arctic Ocean have gradually increased over the last 50 yr, leading to reduced thickness of first-year ice at the start of summer; 2) a temporary shift, starting in 1989, of two principal climate indexes (the Arctic Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) caused a flushing of some of the older, thicker ice out of the basin and...},

from region to region across the United States. We
provide strong evidence that spatial variations in
US temperature trends are linked to the hydrologic
cycle, and we also present unique information on the
seasonal and latitudinal structure of the
linkage. We show that there is a statistically
significant inverse relationship between trends in
daily temperature and average daily precipitation
across regions. This linkage is most pronounced in
the southern United States (30-40 degrees N) during
the May-June time period and, to a lesser extent, in
the northern United States (40-50 degrees N) during
the July-August time period. It is strongest in
trends in maximum temperatures (T-max) and 90th
percentile exceedance trends (90PET), and less
pronounced in the T-max 10PET and the corresponding
T-min statistics, and it is robust to changes in
analysis period. Although previous studies suggest
that areas of increased precipitation may have
reduced trends in temperature compared with drier
regions, a change in sign from positive to negative
trends suggests some additional cause. We show that
trends in precipitation may account for some, but
not likely all, of the cause point to evidence that
shows that dynamical patterns (El Nino/Southern
Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, etc.)
cannot account for the observed effects during
May-June. We speculate that changing aerosols,
perhaps related to vegetation changes, and increased
strength of the aerosol direct and indirect effect
may play a role in the observed linkages between
these indices of temperature change and the

These regional differences require local surface heat flux changes (+/-4 watts per square meter) much larger than the basinwide average.

In the absence of ocean coupling, the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss is confined to north of 30°N, consisting of a weakening and equatorward shift of the westerlies accompanied by lower tropospheric warming and enhanced precipitation at high latitudes. With ocean feedbacks, the response expands to cover the whole globe and exhibits a high degree of equatorial symmetry: the entire troposphere warms, the global hydrological cycle strengthens, and the intertropical convergence zones shift equatorward. Ocean dynamics are fundamental to producing this equatorially symmetric pattern...},

abstract = {In recent years, an evaluation technique for Earth System Models (ESMs) has arisen—emergent constraints (ECs)—which rely on strong statistical relationships between aspects of current climate and future change across an ESM ensemble. Combining the EC relationship with observations could reduce uncertainty surrounding future change. Here, we articulate a framework to assess ECs, and provide indicators whereby a proposed EC may move from a strong statistical relationship to confirmation. The primary indicators are verified mechanisms and out-of-sample testing. Confirmed ECs have the potential to improve ESMs by focusing attention on the variables most relevant to climate projections. Looking forward, there may be undiscovered ECs for extremes and teleconnections, and ECs may help identify climate system tipping points.},

Research Unit (CRU) land station temperature
database that has been used to produce a grid-box
data set of 5 degrees latitude x 5 degrees longitude
temperature anomalies. The new database (CRUTEM4)
comprises 5583 station records of which 4842 have
enough data for the 1961-1990 period to calculate or
estimate the average temperatures for this
period. Many station records have had their data
replaced by newly homogenized series that have been
produced by a number of studies, particularly from
National Meteorological Services (NMSs). Hemispheric
temperature averages for land areas developed with
the new CRUTEM4 data set differ slightly from their
CRUTEM3 equivalent. The inclusion of much additional
data from the Arctic (particularly the Russian
Arctic) has led to estimates for the Northern
Hemisphere (NH) being warmer by about 0.1 degrees C
for the years since 2001. The NH/Southern Hemisphere
(SH) warms by 1.12 degrees C/0.84 degrees C over the
period 1901-2010. The robustness of the hemispheric
averages is assessed by producing five different
analyses, each including a different subset of 20{\%}
of the station time series and by omitting some
large countries. CRUTEM4 is also compared with
hemispheric averages produced by reanalyses
undertaken by the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF): ERA-40 (1958-2001) and
ERA-Interim (1979-2010) data sets. For the NH,
agreement is good back to 1958 and excellent from
1979 at monthly, annual, and decadal time
scales. For the SH, agreement is poorer, but if the
area is restricted to the SH north of 60 degrees S,
the agreement is dramatically improved from the
mid-1970s.},

abstract = {Ensembles of climate model simulations are commonly used to separate externally forced climate change from internal variability. However, much of the information gained from running large ensembles is lost in traditional methods of data reduction such as linear trend analysis or large-scale spatial averaging. This paper demonstrates how a pattern recognition method (signal-to-noise-maximizing pattern filtering) extracts patterns of externally forced climate change from large ensembles and identifies the forced climate response with up to 10 times fewer ensemble members than simple ensemble averaging. It is particularly effective at filtering out spatially coherent modes of internal variability (e.g., El Nin{\~{o}}, North Atlantic Oscillation), which would otherwise alias into estimates of regional responses to forcing. This method is used to identify forced climate responses within the 40-member Community Earth System Model (CESM) large ensemble, including an El Nin{\~{o}}-like response to volcanic eruptions and forced trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation. The ensemblebased estimate of the forced response is used to test statistical methods for isolating the forced response from a single realization (i.e., individual ensemble members). Low-frequency pattern filtering is found to skillfully identify the forced response within individual ensemble members and is applied to the HadCRUT4 reconstruction of observed temperatures, whereby it identifies slow components of observed temperature changes that are consistent with the expected effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing.},

We investigated the extent to which state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs) can capture this hiatus period by using multimodel ensembles of historical climate simulations. While the SATg linear trend for the last decade is not captured by their ensemble means regardless of differences in model generation and external forcing, it is barely represented by an 11-member ensemble of a GCM, suggesting an internal origin of the hiatus associated with active heat uptake by the oceans. Besides, we found opposite changes in ocean heat uptake efficiency ($\kappa$), weakening in models and strengthening in nature, which explain why the models tend to overestimate the SATg trend. The weakening of $\kappa$ commonly found in GCMs seems to be an inevitable response of the climate system to global warming, suggesting the recovery from hiatus in coming decades.

abstract = {The observed lack of twentieth-century warming in
the central United States (CUS), denoted here as the
"warming hole," was examined in 55 simulations
driven by external historical forcings and in 19
preindustrial control (unforced) simulations from 18
coupled general circulation models
(CGCMs). Twentieth-century CUS trends were positive
for the great majority of simulations, but were
negative, as observed, for seven simulations. Only a
few simulations exhibited the observed rapid rate of
warming ( cooling) during 1901 - 40 ( 1940 -
79). Those models with multiple runs ( identical
forcing but different initial conditions) showed
considerable intramodel variability with trends
varying by up to 1.8 degrees C century(-1),
suggesting that internal dynamic variability played
a major role at the regional scale. The wide range
of trend outcomes, particularly for those models
with multiple runs, and the small number of
simulations similar to observations in both the
forced and unforced experiments suggest that the
warming hole is not a robust response of
contemporary CGCMs to the estimated external
forcings. A more likely explanation based on these
models is that the observed warming hole involves
external forcings combined with internal dynamic
variability that is much larger than typically
simulated. The observed CUS temperature variations
are positively correlated with North Atlantic (NA)
sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and both NA SSTs
and CUS temperature are negatively correlated with
central equatorial Pacific (CEP) SSTs. Most models
simulate rather well the connection between CUS
temperature and NA SSTs. However, the
teleconnections between NA and CEP SSTS and between
CEP SSTs and CUS temperature are poorly simulated
and the models produce substantially less NA SST
variability than observed, perhaps hampering their
ability to reproduce the warming hole.},

Accurate CryoSat-2 range measurements over open water and the ice surface of the order of centimetres are necessary to achieve the required accuracy of the freeboard-to-thickness conversion. Besides uncertainties of the actual sea-surface height and limited knowledge of ice and snow properties, the composition of radar backscatter and therefore the interpretation of radar echoes is crucial. This has consequences in the selection of retracker algorithms which are used to track the main scattering horizon and assign a range estimate to each CryoSat-2 measurement. In this study we apply a retracker algorithm with thresholds of 40, 50 and 80{\%} of the first maximum of radar echo power, spanning the range of values used in the current literature. By using the selected retrackers and additionally results from airborne validation measurements, we evaluate the uncertainties of sea-ice freeboard and higher-level products that arise from the choice of the retracker threshold only, independent of the uncertainties related to snow and ice properties. Our study shows that the choice of retracker thresholds does have a significant impact on magnitudes of estimates of sea-ice freeboard and thickness, but that the spatial distributions of these parameters are less affected. Specifically we find mean radar freeboard values of 0.121 m (0.265 m) for the 40{\%} threshold, 0.086 m (0.203 m) for the 50{\%} threshold and 0.024 m (0.092 m) for the 80{\%} threshold, considering first-year ice (multiyear ice) in March 2013. We show that the main source of freeboard and thickness uncertainty results from the choice of the retracker and the unknown penetration of the radar pulse into the snow layer in conjunction with surface roughness effects. These uncertainties can cause a freeboard bias of roughly 0.06–0.12 m. Furthermore we obtain a significant rise of 0.02–0.15 m of freeboard from March 2013 to November 2013 in the area for multiyear sea ice north of Greenland and Canada. Since this is unlikely, it gives rise to the assumption that applying different retracker thresholds depending on seasonal properties of the snow load is necessary in the future.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The effects included are long wave radiation by water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone and the absorption of solar radiation by these three gases. The absorptivities of these gases are determined based upon the recent results of laboratory experiments and those of theoretical computations. The effects of clouds are not included. By use of this scheme the radiative equilibrium temperature is computed for various latitudes and seasons as asymptotic solutions of an initial value problem. To a certain degree the radiative equilibrium solutions reveal some of the typical characteristics of stratospheric temperature and tropopause height variations. Radiative heat budgets of the atmosphere are also computed and compared with the results of the computations of radiative equilibrium. This comparison helpful for understanding the role of radiative processes and also suggests the kinds of effect we should expect from other thermal processes in the atmosphere.},

abstract = {The dynamical mechanisms through which stratospheric forcing can influence tropospheric annular modes are explored. A torque is applied to the stratosphere of an idealized general circulation model, and, under some circumstances, a robust tropospheric response is observed. These tropospheric responses, while initiated by stratospheric forcing, are maintained locally by interactions with transient eddies, and they closely resemble the intrinsic annular modes of the model. Manipulations of the model are consistent in showing that planetary waves, and not only the zonally symmetric secondary circulations induced by stratospheric forcing, are important for transmitting dynamical signals to the troposphere. Specifically, it is found that the tropospheric response is significantly reduced when planetary waves are suppressed in the stratosphere by additional damping or when the strength of the stratospheric jet is increased. Wave diagnoses indicate that the confinement of these waves within the troposph...},

abstract = {Hurricanes Isaac (2012), Harvey (2017), and Irma (2017) were storms with different geophysical characteristics and track forecast consistencies. Despite the differences, common themes emerged from the perception of track forecasts from evacuees for each storm. Surveys with a mixture of closed and open-ended responses were conducted during the evacuations of each storm while the storm characteristics and decision-making were fresh in the minds of evacuees. Track perception accuracy for each evacuee was quantified by taking the difference between three metrics: Perceived track and official track (PT − OT), perceived track and forecast track (PT − FT), and home location and perceived track (HL − PT). Evacuees from Hurricanes Isaac and Harvey displayed a tendency to perceive hurricane tracks as being closer to their home locations than what was forecast to occur and what actually occurred. The large sample collected for Hurricane Irma provided a chance to statistically verify some of the hypotheses generated from Isaac and Harvey. Results from Hurricane Irma confirmed that evacuees expected a storm to be closer to their home locations after controlling for regional influences. Furthermore, participants with greater previous hurricane experience perceived a track as being closer to their home locations, and participants residing in zip codes corresponding with nonmandatory evacuation zones also perceived tracks as being closer to their home locations. These findings suggest that most evacuees from hurricanes in the United States appear to perceive storms as being closer to their home locations than they are and overestimate wind speeds at their homes, thus overestimating the true danger from landfalling hurricanes in many storms.},

abstract = {Past research argues for an internal multidecadal (40-to 60-year) oscillation distinct from climate noise. Recent studies have claimed that this so-termed Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is instead a manifestation of competing time-varying effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. That conclusion is bolstered by the absence of robust multidecadal climate oscillations in control simulations of current-generation models. Paleoclimate data, however, do demonstrate multidecadal oscillatory behavior during the preindustrial era. By comparing control and forced "Last Millennium" simulations, we show that these apparent multidecadal oscillations are an artifact of pulses of volcanic activity during the preindustrial era that project markedly onto the multidecadal (50-to 70-year) frequency band. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence for internal multidecadal oscillations in the climate system.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}![CDATA[Abstract. A global land–ocean temperature record has been created by combining the Berkeley Earth monthly land temperature field with spatially kriged version of the HadSST3 dataset. This combined product spans the period from 1850 to present and covers the majority of the Earth's surface: approximately 57 {\%} in 1850, 75 {\%} in 1880, 95 {\%} in 1960, and 99.9 {\%} by 2015. It includes average temperatures in 1∘×1∘ lat–long grid cells for each month when available. It provides a global mean temperature record quite similar to records from Hadley's HadCRUT4, NASA's GISTEMP, NOAA's GlobalTemp, and Cowtan and Way and provides a spatially complete and homogeneous temperature field. Two versions of the record are provided, treating areas with sea ice cover as either air temperature over sea ice or sea surface temperature under sea ice, the former being preferred for most applications. The choice of how to assess the temperature of areas with sea ice coverage has a notable impact on global anomalies over past decades due to rapid warming of air temperatures in the Arctic. Accounting for rapid warming of Arctic air suggests ∼ 0.1 ∘C additional global-average temperature rise since the 19th century than temperature series that do not capture the changes in the Arctic. Updated versions of this dataset will be presented each month at the Berkeley Earth website (http://berkeleyearth.org/data/, last access: November 2020), and a convenience copy of the version discussed in this paper has been archived and is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3634713 (Rohde and Hausfather, 2020).]]{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As Rita approached the Gulf Coast, uncertainties in the storm's track and intensity forecasts, combined with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, led to major evacuations along the Texas coast and significant traffic jams in the broader Houston area. This study investigates the societal impacts of Hurricane Rita and its forecasts through a face-to-face survey with 120 Texas Gulf Coast residents. The survey explored respondents' evacuation decisions prior to Hurricane Rita, their perceptions of hurricane risk, and their use of and opinions on Hurricane Rita forecasts. The vast majority of respondents evacuated from Hurricane Rita, and more than half stated that Hurricane Katrina affected their evacuation decision. Although some respondents said that their primary reason for evacuating was local officials' evacuation order, many reported using information about the hurricane to evaluate the risk it posed to them and their families. Despite the major traffic jams and the minor damage in many evacuated regions, most evacuees interviewed do not regret their decision to evacuate. The majority of respondents stated that they intend to evacuate for a future category 3 hurricane, but the majority would stay for a category 2 hurricane. Most respondents obtained forecasts from multiple sources and reported checking forecasts frequently. Despite the forecast uncertainties, the respondents had high confidence in and satisfaction with the forecasts of Rita provided by the National Hurricane Center. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {One of the outstanding questions regarding the observed relationship between October Eurasian snow cover anomalies and the boreal winter northern annular mode (NAM) is what causes the multiple-week lag between positive Eurasian snow cover anomalies in October and the associated peak in Rossby wave activity flux from the troposphere to the stratosphere in December. This study explores the following hypothesis about this lag: in order to achieve amplification of the wave activity, the vertically propagating Rossby wave train associated with the snow cover anomaly must reinforce the climatological stationary wave, which corresponds to constructive linear interference between the anomalous wave and the climatological wave. It is shown that the lag in peak wave activity flux arises because the Rossby wave train associated with the snow cover is in quadrature or out of phase with the climatological stationary wave from October to mid-November. Beginning in mid-November the associated wave anomaly migrates into a position that is in phase with the climatological wave, leading to constructive interference and anomalously positive upward wave activity fluxes until mid-January. Climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) do not capture this behavior. This linear interference effect is not only associated with stratospheric variability related to Eurasian snow cover anomalies but is a general feature of Northern Hemisphere troposphere–stratosphere interactions and, in particular, dominated the negative NAM events of the fall–winter of 2009/10.},

abstract = {The observed slow-down in the global-mean surface temperature (GST) warming from 1998 to 2012 has been called a “warming hiatus.” Certain climate models, operating under experiments which simulate warming by increasing radiative forcing, have been shown to reproduce periods which resemble the observed hiatus. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of 38 CMIP5 climate models to provide further evidence that models produce warming hiatus periods during warming experiments. GST rates are simulated in each model for the 21st century using two experiments: a moderate warming scenario (RCP4.5) and high-end scenario (RCP8.5). Warming hiatus periods are identified in model simulations by detecting (1) ≥15-year periods lacking a statistically meaningful trend and (2) rapid changes in the GST rate which resemble the observed 1998–2012 hiatus. Under the RCP4.5 experiment, all tested models produce warming hiatus periods. However, once radiative forcing exceeds 5 W/m 2 —about 2°C GST increase—as simulated in the RCP8.5 experiment after 2050, nearly all models produce only positive warming trends. All models show evidence of rapid changes in the GST rate resembling the observed hiatus, showing that the climate variations associated with warming hiatus periods are still evident in the models, even under accelerated warming conditions.},

Advances in remote sensing of sea ice over the past two decades have resulted in a wide variety of satellite-derived sea ice thickness data products becoming publicly available. Selecting the most appropriate product is challenging given end user objectives range from incorporating satellite-derived thickness information in operational activities, including sea ice forecasting, routing of maritime traffic and search and rescue, to climate change analysis, longer-term modelling, prediction and future planning. Depending on the use case, selecting the most suitable satellite data product can depend on the region of interest, data latency, and whether the data are provided routinely, for example via a climate or maritime service provider. Here we examine a suite of current sea ice thickness data products, collating key details of primary interest to end users. We assess 8 years of sea ice thickness observations derived from sensors on board the CryoSat-2 (CS2), Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellites. We evaluate the satellite-only observations with independent ice draft and thickness measurements obtained from the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project (BGEP) upward looking sonar (ULS) instruments and Operation IceBridge (OIB), respectively. We find a number of key differences among data products but find that products utilizing CS2-only measurements are reliable for sea ice thickness, particularly between ∼0.5 and 4 m. Among data compared, a blended CS2-SMOS product was the most reliable for thin ice. Ice thickness distributions at the end of winter appeared realistic when compared with independent ice draft measurements, with the exception of those derived from AVHRR. There is disagreement among the products in terms of the magnitude of the mean thickness trends, especially in spring 2017. Regional comparisons reveal noticeable differences in ice thickness between products, particularly in the marginal seas in areas of considerable ship traffic.]]{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Stratospheric variability has also been shown to affect short-term and seasonal forecasts, connecting the tropics and midlatitudes and guiding storm-track dynamics.

abstract = {Arctic sea ice extent is nowmore than twomillion square kilometers less than it was in the late twentieth century, with important consequences for the climate, the ocean and traditional lifestyles in the Arctic 1,2. Although observations show a more or less continuous decline for the past four or five decades 3,4, there are few long-term records withwhich to assess natural sea ice variability. Until now, the question of whether or not current trends are potentially anomalous 5 has therefore remained unanswerable. Here we use a network of high-resolution terrestrial proxies from the circum-Arctic region to reconstruct past extents of summer sea ice, and show that- although extensive uncertainties remain, especially before the sixteenth century-both the duration and magnitude of the current decline in sea ice seem to be unprecedented for the past 1,450 years. Enhanced advection of warm Atlantic water to the Arctic 6 seems to be the main factor driving the decline of sea ice extent on multidecadal timescales, and may result from nonlinear feedbacks between sea ice and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. These results reinforce the assertion that sea ice is an active component of Arctic climate variability and that the recent decrease in summer Arctic sea ice is consistent with anthropogenically forced warming. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The onset of spring is a critical time in
mid-latitude atmosphere-biosphere
interactions. Deciduous plants resume growth after
winter dormancy, and their activities cause land
surfaces to become more active agents in energy and
mass exchanges. The progress of spring plant
development driving these changes can be
conveniently monitored by observation of plant
life-stage (phenological) events. Thus, phenological
data can play a crucial role in understanding and
monitoring springtime vegetation and climate
dynamics, especially about potential changes over
time. Although global-scale phenological monitoring
is not yet possible, alternative strategies are
available to assess these impacts. In this paper, a
simple phenological model, driven by surface-level
daily maximum-minimum temperatures is employed as a
surrogate measure of the onset of spring in
China. Contrasting with results from similar studies
in North America and Europe, the onset of spring
plant growth in China has no apparent change over
1959-1993. However, during the same period, last
spring frost (-2.2degreesC) dates have become
markedly earlier (by 6 d), with the greatest change
occurring in the northeast portions of the
country. First autumn frost dates have also become
later (by 4 d), especially in north-central
China. Combining these 2 changes, the frost period
has decreased by 10 d over many northern regions of
the country. A shorting frost period is consistent
with decreasing diurnal temperature ranges and
day-to-day temperature differences during spring and
autumn in China, reported by previous research.},

Although these cold winters are thought to be partly driven by dramatic losses of Arctic sea-ice, the mechanism that links sea-ice loss to cold winters remains a subject of debate. Here, by conducting observational analyses and model experiments, we show how Arctic sea-ice loss and cold winters in extra-polar regions are dynamically connected through the polar stratosphere. We find that decreased sea-ice cover during early winter months (November– December), especially over the Barents–Kara seas, enhances the upward propagation of planetary-scale waves with wavenumbers of 1 and 2, subsequently weakening the strato-spheric polar vortex in mid-winter (January–February). The weakened polar vortex preferentially induces a negative phase of Arctic Oscillation at the surface, resulting in low temperatures in mid-latitudes.},

The recent and projected polar warming, and its effects on the meridional temperature gradients, suggests a possible weakening of eddy heat fluxes. We here examine this question in reanalyses and state-of-the-art global climate models. In the Northern Hemisphere we find that the eddy heat flux has robustly weakened over the last four decades. We further show that this weakening emerged from the internal variability around the year 2000, and we attribute it to increasing greenhouse gases. In contrast, in the Southern Hemisphere we find that the eddy heat flux has robustly strengthened, and we link this strengthening to the recent multi-decadal cooling of Southern-Ocean surface temperatures. The inability of state-of-the-art climate models to simulate such cooling prevents them from capturing the observed Southern Hemisphere strengthening of the eddy heat flux. This discrepancy between models and reanalyses provides a clear example of how model biases in polar regions can affect the midlatitude climate.},

abstract = {Attribution studies on recent global warming by Global Climate Model (GCM) ensembles converge in showing the fundamental role of anthropogenic forcings as primary drivers of temperature in the last half century. However, despite their differences, all these models pertain to the same dynamical approach and come from a common ancestor, so that their very similar results in attribution studies are not surprising and cannot be considered as a clear proof of robustness of the results themselves. Thus, here we adopt a completely different, non-dynamical, data-driven and fully nonlinear approach to the attribution problem. By means of neural network (NN) modelling, and analysing the last 160 years, we perform attribution experiments and find that the strong increase in global temperature of the last half century may be attributed basically to anthropogenic forcings (with details on their specific contributions), while the Sun considerably influences the period 1910–1975. Furthermore, the role of sulphate aerosols and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation for better catching interannual to decadal temperature variability is clarified. Sensitivity analyses to forcing changes are also performed. The NN outcomes both corroborate our previous knowledge from GCMs and give new insight into the relative contributions of external forcings and internal variability to climate.},

abstract = {Multi-model ensembles can be used to estimate uncertainty in projections of regional climate, but this uncertainty often depends on the constituents of the ensemble. The dependence of uncertainty on ensemble composition is clear when single-model initial condition large ensembles (SMILEs) are included within a multi-model ensemble. SMILEs allow for the quantification of internal variability, a non-negligible component of uncertainty on regional scales, but may also serve to inappropriately narrow uncertainty by giving a single model many additional votes. In advance of the mixed multi-model, the SMILE Coupled Model Intercomparison version 6 (CMIP6) ensemble, we investigate weighting approaches to incorporate 50 members of the Community Earth System Model (CESM1.2.2-LE), 50 members of the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2-LE), and 100 members of the MPI Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) into an 88-member Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble. The weights assigned are based on ability to reproduce observed climate (performance) and scaled by a measure of redundancy (dependence). Surface air temperature (SAT) and sea level pressure (SLP) predictors are used to determine the weights, and relationships between present and future predictor behavior are discussed. The estimated residual thermodynamic trend is proposed as an alternative predictor to replace 50-year regional SAT trends, which are more susceptible to internal variability. Uncertainty in estimates of northern European winter and Mediterranean summer end-of-century warming is assessed in a CMIP5 and a combined SMILE-CMIP5 multi-model ensemble. Five different weighting strategies to account for the mix of initial condition (IC) ensemble members and individually represented models within the multi-model ensemble are considered. Allowing all multi-model ensemble members to receive either equal weight or solely a performance weight (based on the root mean square error (RMSE) between members and observations over nine predictors) is shown to lead to uncertainty estimates that are dominated by the presence of SMILEs. A more suitable approach includes a dependence assumption, scaling either by 1=N, the number of constituents representing a "model", or by the same RMSE distance metric used to define model performance. SMILE contributions to the weighted ensemble are smallest ({\textless} 10 {\%}) when a model is defined as an IC ensemble and increase slightly ({\textless} 20 {\%}) when the definition of a model expands to include members from the same institution and/or development stream. SMILE contributions increase further when dependence is defined by RMSE (over nine predictors) amongst members because RMSEs between SMILE members can be as large as RMSEs between SMILE members and other models. We find that an alternative RMSE distance metric, derived from global SAT and hemispheric SLP climatology, is able to better identify IC members in general and SMILE members in particular as members of the same model. Further, more subtle dependencies associated with resolution differences and component similarities are also identified by the global predictor set.},

Australia's agricultural output, have experienced a
severe drought (termed the "Big Dry'') with record
high temperatures and record low inflow. We find
that during the Big Dry the sensitivity of soil
moisture to rainfall decline is over 80{\%} higher
than during the World War II drought from
1937-1945. A relationship exists between soil
moisture and temperature independent of rainfall,
particularly in austral spring and summer. Annually,
a rise of 1 degrees C leads to a 9{\%} reduction in
soil moisture over the southern MDB, contributing to
the recent high sensitivity. Since 1950, the impact
from rising temperature contributes to 45{\%} of the

as the same process also leads to an inflow
reduction, the reduced water availability can only
be mitigated by increased rainfall. Other

The role of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in modulating this response is discussed by differentiating easterly and westerly QBO years. The remote influence of Siberian snow anomalies is found to be weak in the models, especially in the stratosphere where the “Holton–Tan” effect of the QBO dominates the simulated snow influence on the polar vortex. At the surface, discrepancies between composite analyses from observations and model results question the causal relationship between snow and the atmospheric circulation, suggesting that the atmosphere might have driven snow anomalies rather than the other way around. When both forcings are combined, the simulations suggest destructive interference between the response to positive snow anomalies and easterly QBO (and vice versa), at odds with the hypothesis that the s...},

abstract = {Fluctuations in spring climate in the western United
States over the last 4-5 decades are described by
examining changes in the blooming of plants and the
timing of snowmelt-runoff pulses. The two measures
of spring's onset that are employed are the timing
of first bloom of lilac and honeysuckle bushes from
a long-term cooperative phenological network, and
the timing of the first major pulse of snowmelt
recorded from high-elevation streams. Both measures
contain year-to-year fluctuations, with typical
year-to year fluctuations at a given site of one to
three weeks. These fluctuations are spatially
coherent, forming regional patterns that cover most
of the west. Fluctuations in lilac first bloom dates
are highly correlated to those of honeysuckle, and
both are significantly correlated with those of the
spring snowmelt pulse. Each of these measures, then,
probably respond to a common mechanism. Various
analyses indicate that anomalous temperature exerts
the greatest influence upon both interannual and
secular changes in the onset of spring in these
networks. Earlier spring onsets since the late 1970s
are a remarkable feature of the records, and reflect
the unusual spell of warmer-than-normal springs in
western North America during this period. The warm
episodes are clearly related to larger-scale
atmospheric conditions across North America and the
North Pacific, but whether this is predominantly an
expression of natural variability or also a symptom
of global warming is not certain.},

confirm the literature regression of delta(18)O

is generally well represented by individual coral
time series, observed decadal and secular
variability does not always display a linear
relationship to local SST anomaly. Instead, many
records appear to better recover nonlocal,
large-scale phenomena, which in turn are related to
either the coral local SST or SST covariant changes
in seawater delta(18)O. We employ empirical
orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to identify
common patterns of variability in the coral data. We
find two significant patterns which are
interpretable as the oceanographic signature of the
El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and as a
near-global warming in which the eastern equatorial
Pacific cools. A third pattern weakly resembles the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation. These modes are seen
more clearly in a singular Vector decomposition
(SVD) of the covariance between the coral data and
the dominant patterns of large-scale historical SST
variability. The results are consistent with those
found in EOF and SVD analyses of SST data from the
coral locations. As additional coral-based proxy
estimates become available, they will improve the
resolution of the patterns recovered. These results
suggest that a sparse network of coral data may be
used to reconstruct interannual, secular, and
decadal SST variability for preinstrumental periods,

Two 160-yr simulations are conducted: one with surface boundary conditions fixed at late twentieth-century values and the other with identical conditions except for Arctic sea ice, which is prescribed at late twenty-first-century values. Their difference isolates the impact of future Arctic sea ice loss upon the atmosphere. The tropospheric circulation response to the imposed ice loss resembles the negative phase of the northern annular mode, with the largest amplitude in winter, while the less well-known stratospheric response transitions from a slight weakening of the polar vortex in winter to a strengthening of the vortex in spring. The lack of a significant winter stratospheric circulation response is shown to be a consequence of largely cancelling effects from sea ice loss in the Atlantic and Pacific s...},

A positive AO weakens the basin-scale anticyclonic sea ice drift and decreases the winter ice thickness by 15cm and 10cm in the Eurasian and the Pacific sectors of the Arctic respectively. Three reanalysis datasets show that the upward surface heat fluxes are reduced over wide areas of the Arctic, suppressing the ice growth during the positive AO winters. The winter dynamic and thermodynamic thinning preconditions the ice for enhanced radiative forcing via the ice-albedo feedback in late spring–summer, leading to an additional 10 cm of thinning over the Pacific sector of the Arctic.

This hybrid setup makes it possible to simulate the isolated impact of sea ice loss and provides a more complete response compared to experiments with fixed sea surface temperatures. Three investigated sea ice scenarios with ice loss in different regions all exhibit substantial near-surface warming, which peaks over the area of ice loss.

From a dataset of 88125 climate-related papers published since 2012, when this question was last addressed comprehensively, we examine a randomized subset of 3000 such publications. We also use a second sample-weighted approach that was specifically biased with keywords to help identify any sceptical peer-reviewed papers in the whole dataset. We identify four sceptical papers out of the sub-set of 3000, as evidenced by abstracts that were rated as implicitly or explicitly sceptical of human-caused global warming.

give a better representation of abnormal wetness and

is necessary so that all users of the index will

values may be obtained. This article describes the
effect on the SPI values computed from different
probability models as well as the effects on dry
event characteristics. It is concluded that the
Pearson Type III distribution is the "best"
universal model, and that the reliability of the SPI
is sample size dependent. It is also concluded that
because of data limitations, SPIs with time scales
longer than 24 months may be unreliable. An internet

abstract = {We introduce a novel method to combat label noise when training deep neural networks for classification. We propose a loss function that permits abstention during training thereby allowing the DNN to abstain on confusing samples while continuing to learn and improve classification performance on the non-abstained samples. We show how such a deep abstaining classifier (DAC) can be used for robust learning in the presence of different types of label noise. In the case of structured or systematic label noise -- where noisy training labels or confusing examples are correlated with underlying features of the data-- training with abstention enables representation learning for features that are associated with unreliable labels. In the case of unstructured (arbitrary) label noise, abstention during training enables the DAC to be used as an effective data cleaner by identifying samples that are likely to have label noise. We provide analytical results on the loss function behavior that enable dynamic adaption of abstention rates based on learning progress during training. We demonstrate the utility of the deep abstaining classifier for various image classification tasks under different types of label noise; in the case of arbitrary label noise, we show significant improvements over previously published results on multiple image benchmarks.

abstract = {Surface air temperature over central Eurasia decreased over the past twenty-five winters at a time of strongly increasing anthropogenic forcing and Arctic amplification. It has been suggested that this cooling was related to an increase in cold winters due to sea-ice loss in the Barents-Kara Sea. Here we use over 600 years of atmosphere-only global climate model simulations to isolate the effect of Arctic sea-ice loss, complemented with a 50-member ensemble of atmosphere-ocean global climate model simulations allowing for external forcing changes (anthropogenic and natural) and internal variability. In our atmosphere-only simulations, we find no evidence of Arctic sea-ice loss having impacted Eurasian surface temperature. In our atmosphere-ocean simulations, we find just one simulation with Eurasian cooling of the observed magnitude but Arctic sea-ice loss was not involved, either directly or indirectly. Rather, in this simulation the cooling is due to a persistent circulation pattern combining high pressure over the Barents-Kara Sea and a downstream trough. We conclude that the observed cooling over central Eurasia was probably due to a sea-ice-independent internally generated circulation pattern ensconced over, and nearby, the Barents-Kara Sea since the 1980s. These results improve our knowledge of high-latitude climate variability and change, with implications for our understanding of impacts in high-northern-latitude systems.},

Common applications include image classification, e.g., to determine whether an image contains a tropical cyclone, and image-to-image translation, e.g., to emulate radar imagery for satellites that only have passive channels. However, there are yet many open questions regarding the use of neural networks for working with meteorological images, such as best practices for evaluation, tuning, and interpretation. This article highlights several strategies and practical considerations for neural network development that have not yet received much attention in the meteorological community, such as the concept of receptive fields, underutilized meteorological performance measures, and methods for neural network interpretation, such as synthetic experiments and layer-wise relevance propagation. We also consider the process of neural network interpretation as a whole, recognizing it as an iterative meteorologist-driven discovery process that builds on experimental design and hypothesis generation and testing. Finally, while most work on neural network interpretation in meteorology has so far focused on networks for image classification tasks, we expand the focus to also include networks for image-to-image translation.},

abstract = {The rise in Arctic near-surface air temperatures has been almost twice as large as the global average in recent decades-a feature known as 'Arctic amplification'. Increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases have driven Arctic and global average warming; however, the underlying causes of Arctic amplification remain uncertain. The roles of reductions in snow and sea ice cover and changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation, cloud cover and water vapour are still matters of debate. A better understanding of the processes responsible for the recent amplified warming is essential for assessing the likelihood, and impacts, of future rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss. Here we show that the Arctic warming is strongest at the surface during most of the year and is primarily consistent with reductions in sea ice cover. Changes in cloud cover, in contrast, have not contributed strongly to recent warming. Increases in atmospheric water vapour content, partly in response to reduced sea ice cover, may have enhanced warming in the lower part of the atmosphere during summer and early autumn. We conclude that diminishing sea ice has had a leading role in recent Arctic temperature amplification. The findings reinforce suggestions that strong positive ice-temperature feedbacks have emerged in the Arctic, increasing the chances of further rapid warming and sea ice loss, and will probably affect polar ecosystems, ice-sheet mass balance and human activities in the Arctic.},

The average of a 50-member initial condition ensemble of the second generation Canadian Earth System Model version 2 that was forced only with AA does not exhibit the negative-Pacific Decadal Oscillation/slowdown response.

This illustrates the caution needed in interpreting regional- and decadal-scale responses to AA and suggests that improved characterization of model uncertainty in AA over the recent period is required.},

abstract = {The primary focus of this review is
tropical-extratropical interactions and especially
the issues involved in determining the response of
the extratropical atmosphere to tropical forcing
associated with sea surface temperature (SST)
anomalies. The review encompasses observations,
empirical studies, theory and modeling of the
extratropical teleconnections with a focus on
developments over the Tropical Oceans-Global
Atmosphere (TOGA) decade and the current state of
understanding. In the tropical atmosphere, anomalous
SSTs force anomalies in convection and large-scale
overturning with subsidence in the descending branch
of the local Hadley circulation. The resulting
strong upper tropospheric divergence in the tropics
and convergence in the subtropics act as a Rossby
wave source. The climatological stationary planetary
waves and associated jet streams, especially in the
northern hemisphere, can make the total Rossby wave
sources somewhat insensitive to the position of the
tropical heating that induces them and thus can
create preferred teleconnection response patterns,
such as the Pacific-North American (PNA)
pattern. However, a number of factors influence the
dispersion and propagation of Rossby waves through
the atmosphere, including zonal asymmetries in the
climatological state, transients, and baroclinic and
nonlinear effects. Internal midlatitude sources can
amplify perturbations. Observations, modeling, and
theory have clearly shown how storm tracks change in
response to changes in quasi-stationary waves and
how these changes generally feedback to.maintain or
strengthen the dominant perturbations through
vorticity and momentum transports. The response of
the extratropical atmosphere naturally induces
changes in the underlying surface, so that there are
changes in extratropical SSTs and changes in land
surface hydrology and moisture availability that can
feedback and influence the total response. Land
surface processes are believed to be especially
important in spring and summer. Anomalous SSTs and
tropical forcing have tended to be strongest in the
northern winter, and teleconnections in the southern
hemisphere are weaker and more variable and thus
more inclined to be masked by natural
variability. Occasional strong forcing in seasons
other than winter can produce strong and
identifiable signals in the northern hemisphere and,
because the noise of natural variability is less,
the signal-to-noise ratio can be Large. The relative
importance of tropical versus extratropical SST
forcings has been established through numerical
experiments with atmospheric general circulation
models (AGCMs). Predictability of anomalous
circulation and associated surface temperature and
precipitation in the extratropics is somewhat
limited by the difficulty of finding a modest signal
embedded in the high level of noise from natural
variability in the extra;tropics, and the complexity
and variety of the possible feedbacks. Accordingly,
ensembles of AGCM runs and time averaging are needed
to identify signals and make predictions. Strong
anomalous tropical forcing provides opportunities
for skillful forecasts, and the accuracy and
usefulness of forecasts is expected to improve as
the ability to forecast the anomalous SSTs improves,
as models improve, and as the information available
from the mean and the spread of ensemble forecasts
is better utilized.},

an overlying climate that has a strong seasonality,
similar climate zones to where trees grow with
distinct annual rings. Continuous laminated
stalagmite chronologies (up to several thousand
years) should be expected where some mixing of

reconstruct climate, particularly through variations
in lamina width. Such climate records would be
relatively damped by mixing of 'event' water with
'stored' groundwater, constraining the amount of
high-frequency climate signals contained in the
stalagmite, but relatively long continuous lamina
sequences permit the preservation of low frequency,
centennial scale, climate signals. This contrasts
with numerous tree ring climate records, which are
frequently limited in preserving multi-centennial
trends, due to the necessary removal of age related
noise from relatively short tree segments. Laminated
stalagmites and tree rings should therefore to some
degree provide complementary climate
information. Appropriate methods for compiling

This increased frequency of extreme cyclones is consistent with observed significant winter warming, indicating that the meridional heat and moisture transport they bring is a factor in rising temperatures in the region. The winter trend in extreme cyclones is dominated by a positive monthly trend of about 3-4 events/decade in November-December, due mainly to an increasing persistence of extreme cyclone events. A negative trend in January opposes this, while there is no significant trend in February. We relate the regional patterns of the trend in extreme cyclones to anomalously low sea-ice conditions in recent years, together with associated large-scale atmospheric circulation changes such as 'blockinglike' circulation patterns (e.g. Scandinavian blocking in December and Ural blocking during January-February).},

@article{Fasullo2020,
abstract = {An objective approach is presented for scoring coupled climate simulations through an evaluation against satellite and reanalysis datasets during the satellite era (i.e., since 1979). The approach is motivated, described, and applied to available Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) archives and the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Version 1 Large Ensemble archives with the goal of robustly benchmarking model performance and its evolution across CMIP generations. A scoring system is employed that minimizes sensitivity to internal variability, external forcings, and model tuning. Scores are based on pattern correlations of the simulated mean state, seasonal contrasts, and ENSO teleconnections. A broad range of feedback-relevant fields is considered and summarized on discrete timescales (climatology, seasonal, interannual) and physical realms (energy budget, water cycle, dynamics). Fields are also generally chosen for which observational uncertainty is small compared to model structural differences. Highest mean variable scores across models are reported for well-observed fields such as sea level pressure, precipitable water, and outgoing longwave radiation, while the lowest scores are reported for 500 hPa vertical velocity, net surface energy flux, and precipitation minus evaporation. The fidelity of models is found to vary widely both within and across CMIP generations. Systematic increases in model fidelity in more recent CMIP generations are identified, with the greatest improvements occurring in dynamic and energetic fields. Such examples include shortwave cloud forcing and 500 hPa eddy geopotential height and relative humidity. Improvements in ENSO scores with time are substantially greater than for climatology or seasonal timescales. Analysis output data generated by this approach are made freely available online from a broad range of model ensembles, including the CMIP archives and various singlemodel large ensembles. These multimodel archives allow for an expeditious analysis of performance across a range of simulations, while the CESM large ensemble archive allows for estimation of the influence of internal variability on computed scores. The entire output archive, updated and expanded regularly, can be accessed at http://webext.cgd. ucar.edu/Multi-Case/CMAT/index.html (last access: 18 August 2020).},

abstract = {Among the statistical methods used for seasonal climate prediction, canonical correlation analysis (CCA), a more sophisticated version of the linear regression (LR) method, is well established. Recently, neural networks (NN) have been applied to seasonal climate prediction. Unlike CCA and LR, NN is a nonlinear method, which leads to the question whether the nonlinearity of NN brings any extra prediction skill. In this study, an objective comparison between the three methods (CCA, LR, and NN) in predicting the equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures (in regions Nino1+2, Nino3, Nino3.4, and Nino4) was made. The skill of NN was found to be comparable to that of LR and CCA. A cross-validated t test showed that the difference between NN and LR and the difference between NN and CCA were not significant at the 5{\%} level. The lack of significant skill difference between the nonlinear NN method and the linear methods suggests that at the seasonal timescale the equatorial Pacific dynamics is basically linear.},

abstract = {The National Snow and Ice Data Center's (NSIDC) Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) comprises three equal-area projections, combined with an infinite number of possible grid definitions. The EASE-Grid is based on a philosophy of digital mapping and gridding definitions developed at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The original, 25 kilometer grids were defined for data products generated by the NOAA/NASA Level 3 Passive Microwave Pathfinder Projects, which include gridded passive microwave brightness temperatures and related geophysical products derived from the brightness temperatures. However, the grids have been adopted by a number of other projects, including the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Polar Pathfinders, the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia (AARI) Sea Ice data, and NSIDC's EASE-Grid versions of the Global Land Cover Classification (GLCC) data and the International Permafrost Association Permafrost and Ground Ice Map. The gridding philosophy used to implement a library of software routines is based on the assumption that a gridded data set is completely defined by two abstractions, the map projection and an overlaid lattice of grid points, often referred to as "cells." The software may be used to define all standard projections, and convert gridded data between them. However, this presentation will be restricted to an overview of the family of specific projections and grids that we have called the NSIDC EASE-Grid, or simply EASE-Grid. The discussion will include how to define a map projection and grid definition in general, and our reasons for choosing equal-area projections and a spherical Earth model for our target applications in particular. It will include some examples of applications and an intercomparison between EASE-Grid data sets.},

@article{Knutti2010,
abstract = {Recent coordinated efforts, in which numerous general circulation climate models have been run for a common set of experiments, have produced large datasets of projections of future climate for various scenarios. Those multimodel ensembles sample initial conditions, parameters, and structural uncertainties in the model design, and they have prompted a variety of approaches to quantifying uncertainty in future climate change. International climate change assessments also rely heavily on these models. These assessments often provide equal-weighted averages as best-guess results, assuming that individual model biases will at least partly cancel and that a model average prediction is more likely to be correct than a prediction from a single model based on the result that a multimodel average of present-day climate generally outperforms any individual model. This study outlines the motivation for using multimodel ensembles and discusses various challenges in interpreting them. Among these challenges are that the number of models in these ensembles is usually small, their distribution in the model or parameter space is unclear, and that extreme behavior is often not sampled. Model skill in simulating present-day climate conditions is shown to relate only weakly to the magnitude of predicted change. It is thus unclear by how much the confidence in future projections should increase based on improvements in simulating present-day conditions, a reduction of intermodel spread, or a larger number of models. Averaging model output may further lead to a loss of signal- for example, for precipitation change where the predicted changes are spatially heterogeneous, such that the true expected change is very likely to be larger than suggested by a model average. Last, there is little agreement on metrics to separate "good" and "bad" models, and there is concern that model development, evaluation, and posterior weighting or ranking are all using the same datasets. While the multimodel average appears to still be useful in some situations, these results show that more quantitative methods to evaluate model performance are critical to maximize the value of climate change projections from global models. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th- and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.},

abstract = {Understanding natural causes of climate change is
vital to evaluate the relative impacts of human
pollution and land surface modification on
climate. We have investigated one of the most
important natural causes of climate change, volcanic
eruptions, by using 54 ice core records from both
the Arctic and Antarctica. Our recently collected
suite of ice core data, more than double the number
of cores ever used before, reduces errors inherent
in reconstructions based on a single or small number
of cores, which enables us to obtain much higher
accuracy in both detection of events and
quantification of the radiative effects. We
extracted volcanic deposition signals from each ice
core record by applying a high-pass loess filter to
the time series and examining peaks that exceed
twice the 31-year running median absolute
deviation. We then studied the spatial pattern of
volcanic sulfate deposition on Greenland and
Antarctica and combined this knowledge with a new
understanding of stratospheric transport of volcanic
aerosols to produce a forcing data set as a function
of month, latitude, and altitude for the past 1500
years. We estimated the uncertainties associated
with the choice of volcanic signal extraction
criteria, ice core sulfate deposition to
stratospheric loading calibration factor, and the
season for the eruptions without a recorded
month. We forced an energy balance climate model
with this new volcanic forcing data set, together
with solar and anthropogenic forcing, to simulate
the large-scale temperature response. The results
agree well with instrumental observations for the
past 150 years and with proxy records for the entire
period. Through better characterization of the
natural causes of climate change, this new data set
will lead to improved prediction of anthropogenic
impacts on climate. The new data set of
stratospheric sulfate injections from volcanic
eruptions for the past 1500 years, as a function of
latitude, altitude, and month, is available for
download in a format suitable for forcing general

precipitation and temperature data for global land
areas on a 2.58 grid. Over Illinois, Mongolia, and
parts of China and the former Soviet Union, where
soil moisture data are available, the PDSI is
significantly correlated ( r = 0.5 to 0.7) with
observed soil moisture content within the top 1-m
depth during warm-season months. The strongest
correlation is in late summer and autumn, and the
weakest correlation is in spring, when snowmelt
plays an important role. Basin-averaged annual PDSI
covary closely ( r = 0.6 to 0.8) with streamflow for
seven of world's largest rivers and several smaller
rivers examined. The results suggest that the PDSI
is a good proxy of both surface moisture conditions
and streamflow. An empirical orthogonal function
(EOF) analysis of the PDSI reveals a fairly linear
trend resulting from trends in precipitation and
surface temperature and an El Nino Southern
Oscillation (ENSO)-induced mode of mostly
interannual variations as the two leading
patterns. The global very dry areas, defined as PDSI
{\textless} -3.0, have more than doubled since the 1970s, with
a large jump in the early 1980s due to an
ENSO-induced precipitation decrease and a subsequent
expansion primarily due to surface warming, while
global very wet areas (PDSI {\textgreater} +3.0) declined
slightly during the 1980s. Together, the global land
areas in either very dry or very wet conditions have
increased from; 20{\%} to 38{\%} since 1972, with
surface warming as the primary cause after the
mid-1980s. These results provide observational
evidence for the increasing risk of droughts as
anthropogenic global warming progresses and produces
both increased temperatures and increased drying.},

These individual contributions, and thus the fundamental mechanisms behind changes in climate extremes, remain largely unknown. Here we apply the probability ratio concept in large-ensemble climate simulations to attribute changes in extreme events to either changes in mean climate or climate variability. We show that increased occurrence of monthly high-temperature events is governed by a warming mean climate. In contrast, future changes in monthly heavy-precipitation events depend to a considerable degree on trends in climate variability. Spatial variations are substantial however, highlighting the relevance of regional processes. The contributions of mean and variability to the probability ratio are largely independent of event threshold, magnitude of warming and climate model. Hence projections of temperature extremes are more robust than those of precipitation extremes, since the mean climate is better understood than climate variability.},

abstract = {We have developed a. global ocean model on the massively parallel CM-2 Connection Machine based on the Bryan-Cox-Semtner ocean general circulation model. This paper discusses the Connection Machine implementation of the model and its performance, as well as major changes that were made in the algorithms and numerical methods. In order to increase the parallel efficiency, we reformulated the barotropic equations to solve for the surface-pressure field rather than the volume-transport streamfunction. In addition to being more efficient, this method has several other advantages over the streamfunction formulation: (1) any number of islands can be included in the computational grid at no extra cost; (2) the model can handle steep gradients in the bottom topography; and (3) the free-surface height is a prognostic variable, which simplifies assimilation of altimetric data into the model. We have also developed a new parallelizable preconditioning method for the solution of the elliptic equation for the surface-pressure field. In order to use a standard conjugate gradient algorithm, an approximate-factorization technique is used to split off the Coriolis terms and obtain a symmetric operator. We then apply a symmetric local approximate-inverse operator as a preconditioning matrix, which is very effective in accelerating convergence to a solution.},

abstract = {Estimating the mean and the covariance matrix of an
incomplete dataset and filling in missing values
with imputed values is generally a nonlinear
problem, which must be solved iteratively. The
expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian
data, an iterative method both for the estimation of
mean values and covariance matrices from incomplete
datasets and for the imputation of missing values,
is taken as the point of departure for the
development of a regularized EM algorithm. In
contrast to the conventional EM algorithm, the
regularized EM algorithm is applicable to sets of
climate data, in which the number of variables
typically exceeds the sample size. The regularized
EM algorithm is based on iterated analyses of linear
regressions of variables with missing values on
variables with available values, with regression
coefficients estimated by ridge regression, a
regularized regression method in which a continuous
regularization parameter controls the filtering of
the noise in the data. The regularization parameter
is determined by generalized cross- validation, such
as to minimize, approximately, the expected mean-
squared error of the imputed values. The regularized
EM algorithm can estimate, and exploit for the
imputation of missing values, both synchronic and
diachronic covariance matrices, which may contain
information on spatial covariability, stationary
temporal covariability, or cyclostationary temporal
covariability. A test of the regularized EM
algorithm with simulated surface temperature data
demonstrates that the algorithm is applicable to
typical sets of climate data and that it leads to
more accurate estimates of the missing values than a
conventional noniterative imputation technique.},

@article{Johnson2019,
abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine existing deep learning techniques for addressing class imbalanced data. Effective classification with imbalanced data is an important area of research, as high class imbalance is naturally inherent in many real-world applications, e.g., fraud detection and cancer detection. Moreover, highly imbalanced data poses added difficulty, as most learners will exhibit bias towards the majority class, and in extreme cases, may ignore the minority class altogether. Class imbalance has been studied thoroughly over the last two decades using traditional machine learning models, i.e. non-deep learning. Despite recent advances in deep learning, along with its increasing popularity, very little empirical work in the area of deep learning with class imbalance exists. Having achieved record-breaking performance results in several complex domains, investigating the use of deep neural networks for problems containing high levels of class imbalance is of great interest. Available studies regarding class imbalance and deep learning are surveyed in order to better understand the efficacy of deep learning when applied to class imbalanced data. This survey discusses the implementation details and experimental results for each study, and offers additional insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Several areas of focus include: data complexity, architectures tested, performance interpretation, ease of use, big data application, and generalization to other domains. We have found that research in this area is very limited, that most existing work focuses on computer vision tasks with convolutional neural networks, and that the effects of big data are rarely considered. Several traditional methods for class imbalance, e.g. data sampling and cost-sensitive learning, prove to be applicable in deep learning, while more advanced methods that exploit neural network feature learning abilities show promising results. The survey concludes with a discussion that highlights various gaps in deep learning from class imbalanced data for the purpose of guiding future research.},

abstract = {Incomplete global coverage is a potential source of bias in global temperature reconstructions if the unsampled regions are not uniformly distributed over the planet's surface. The widely used Hadley Centre-Climatic Reseach Unit Version 4 (HadCRUT4) dataset covers on average about 84{\%} of the globe over recent decades, with the unsampled regions being concentrated at the poles and over Africa. Three existing reconstructions with near-global coverage are examined, each suggesting that HadCRUT4 is subject to bias due to its treatment of unobserved regions. Two alternative approaches for reconstructing global temperatures are explored, one based on an optimal interpolation algorithm and the other a hybrid method incorporating additional information from the satellite temperature record. The methods are validated on the basis of their skill at reconstructing omitted sets of observations. Both methods provide results superior to excluding the unsampled regions, with the hybrid method showing particular skill around the regions where no observations are available. Temperature trends are compared for the hybrid global temperature reconstruction and the raw HadCRUT4 data. The widely quoted trend since 1997 in the hybrid global reconstruction is two and a half times greater than the corresponding trend in the coverage-biased HadCRUT4 data. Coverage bias causes a cool bias in recent temperatures relative to the late 1990s, which increases from around 1998 to the present. Trends starting in 1997 or 1998 are particularly biased with respect to the global trend. The issue is exacerbated by the strong El Ni{\~{n}}o event of 1997-1998, which also tends to suppress trends starting during those years.},

In contrast, it took the Arctic sea ice cover a full 3 decades to register a loss that great in yearly average ice extents. Still, when considering the 40-y record as a whole, the Antarctic sea ice continues to have a positive overall trend in yearly average ice extents, although at 11,300 ± 5,300 km2{\textperiodcentered}y−1, this trend is only 50{\%} of the trend for 1979–2014, before the precipitous decline. Four of the 5 sectors into which the Antarctic sea ice cover is divided all also have 40-y positive trends that are well reduced from their 2014–2017 values. The one anomalous sector in this regard, the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas, has a 40-y negative trend, with the yearly average ice extents decreasing overall in the first 3 decades, reaching a minimum in 2007, and exhibiting an overall upward trend since 2007 (i.e., reflecting a reversal in the opposite direction from the other 4 sectors and the Antarctic sea ice cover as a whole).},

Passive microwave data are combined with historical sources, such as sea ice charts, to create global analyses on a 1° grid from 1850 to 2007. Climatology was used when no information about the sea ice was available. Our main aim was to create a homogenous data set by calculating and applying bias adjustments using periods of overlaps between the different data sources used. National Ice Center charts from 1995 to 2007 have been used as a reference to achieve this. In particular, large bias adjustments have been applied to the passive microwave data in both the Antarctic and Arctic summers. Overall, HadISST.2.1.0.0 contains more ice than HadISST1.1, with higher concentrations, shorter marginal ice zones, and larger extents and areas in some regions and periods. A new method for estimating the concentrations within the ice pack using the distance from the ice edge has been developed and evaluated. This was used when only the extents were known or the original concentration fields were heterogeneous. A number of discontinuities in the HadISST1.1 record are no longer found in HadISST.2.1.0.0.},

abstract = {Aims. We improve the description of the evolution of
the Sun's open and total magnetic flux on time
scales of years to millenia. Methods. In the model
employed here the evolution of the solar total and
open magnetic flux is computed from the flux
emerging at the solar surface in the form of bipolar
magnetic features, which is related to the sunspot
number cycle parameters and can be estimated from
historical records. Compared to earlier versions of
the model in addition to the long-lived open flux,
now also a more rapidly decaying component of the
open flux is considered. The model parameters are
constrained by comparing its output with
observations of the total surface magnetic flux and
with a reconstruction of the open magnetic flux
based on the geomagnetic indexes. A method to
compute the Sun's total magnetic flux and the
sunspot number during the Holocene, starting from
the open flux obtained from cosmogenic isotopes
records, is also presented. Results. By considering
separately a rapidly evolving and a slowly evolving
component of the open flux the model reproduces the
Sun's open flux, as reconstructed based on the
aa-index, much better and a reasonable description
of the radial component of interplanetary magnetic
field data is obtained. The greatest improvement is
in the reproduction of the cyclic variation of the
open flux, including the amplitudes of individual
cycles. Furthermore, we found that approximately
25{\%} of the modeled open flux values since the end
of the Maunder minimum are lower than the averaged
value over 2008, i.e. during the current low
minimum. The same proportion is observed in
reconstructions of the open flux during the Holocene
based on cosmogenic isotopes, which suggests that
the present solar minimum conditions are below
average, but not exceptional in terms of the
heliospheric magnetic flux.},

abstract = {The upper-tropospheric circulation is investigated
for the three months of April, May, and June 1988
during which the Great Plains region of the United
States experienced one of its most severe droughts
in history. It is found that during this period the
April-June (AMJ) seasonal-mean anomaly was not
representative of the variability of 10-day low-pass
anomalies. Rather, over North America large
fluctuations on monthly and shorter timescales
occurred, with the dominant streamfunction anomalies
not strongly anticyclonic until June. In fact, the
AMJ anomaly was dominated by two episodes of rapidly
developing, intense anomalous anticyclones in early
and late June. Examination of the daily 10-day
low-pass streamfunction anomalies at 300 mb suggests
that propagating Rossby waves originating in the
west Pacific played a dominant role in the
initiation of these intense anomalous
anticyclones. Numerical experiments with a linear,
time-dependent, barotropic model also support this
hypothesis. These results suggest that the AMJ
anomaly, which has been characterized as a wave
train seemingly forced in the east Pacific, may not
provide a useful picture of the circulation
associated with the drought. Instead, the drought
may be better studied not as a single seasonal
event, but rather as a succession of events that
together produced a serious hydrological deficit.y},

abstract = {T he positions of the storm track and the seasonal precipitation over Europe and Eastern North America are known to be linked to the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) which is the most prominent pattern of atmospheric variability over middle and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. The NAO is described as an alternation between two pressure systems, the Azores High and the Icelandic Low, which in turn influences weather conditions over large areas 1,2. The Arctic Oscillation (AO, also known as the Northern Annular Mode, NAM) has been introduced 3-5 as a hemispheric climate variability pattern characterized by a primary centre of action over the Arctic and two opposite centres of action in mid-latitudes, one over the North Pacific and the other over the North Atlantic. A negative AO is usually associated with pronounced meridional wind patterns and has been linked with the occurrence of surface extremes in the mid-latitudes 6. Despite the annular (zonally symmetric) structure that characterizes the AO, sea-level pressure (SLP) anomalies in the North Atlantic and North Pacific centres of action are not correlated 7 , suggesting that each one of them can exist independently of the other. The present-day monthly temporal correlation between AO and NAO is very high, with correlation coefficients up to 0.95 (refs. 8,9). For this reason, the NAO is often referred to as the local manifestation of the AO and the two terms have been used interchangeably (for example, refs. 6,10-12). Their variability has been shown to be affected by stratospheric anomalies: in winter, the correlation between the 90-d low pass filtered anomalies of 10 hPa and 1,000 hPa geopotential height (GPH) exceeds 0.65, when surface anomaly time series are lagged by about 3 weeks, meaning that stratospheric anomalies are good precursors to surface NAO/AO conditions 11,13. On the other hand, the stratospheric polar vortex is known to be influenced by various tropospheric phenomena, such as tropical and extratropical variability, including El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 14 , Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) 15 , the Madden-Julian tropical atmospheric oscillation (MJO) 16-18 and sea-ice or snow cover changes in the Arctic region 19-25. Enhanced air-sea fluxes and/or deep convection generate a delayed warming response in the polar stratosphere, which eventually often triggers a negative NAO/AO phase 16,21,23,26. In this study, we analyse the dependence of AO and NAO on climate mean state, showing that their correlation breaks down in a warmer climate and suggesting a sufficient condition for the change. Then, we discuss the implications of these modifications on the stratosphere-troposphere coupling. For this purpose, we analyse the results obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for the historical climate and for the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) scenario, and from simulations of an intermediate complexity model, and compare them to reanalysis data. We compare the present-day climate with the most extreme climatic scenario of RCP 8.5 during the twenty-third century. We choose this time frame to shed light on the theoretical behaviour of these coupled modes of variability and demonstrate that they can behave very differently under large climate forcing.},

abstract = {Solar geoengineering---deliberate reduction in the amount of solar radiation retained by the Earth---has been proposed as a means of counteracting some of the climatic effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. We present results from Experiment G1 of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, in which 12 climate models have simulated the climate response to an abrupt quadrupling of CO2 from preindustrial concentrations brought into radiative balance via a globally uniform reduction in insolation. Models show this reduction largely offsets global mean surface temperature increases due to quadrupled CO2 concentrations and prevents 97{\%} of the Arctic sea ice loss that would otherwise occur under high CO2 levels but, compared to the preindustrial climate, leaves the tropics cooler (−0.3 K) and the poles warmer (+0.8 K). Annual mean precipitation minus evaporation anomalies for G1 are less than 0.2 mm day−1 in magnitude over 92{\%} of the globe, but some tropical regions receive less precipitation, in part due to increased moist static stability and suppression of convection. Global average net primary productivity increases by 120{\%} in G1 over simulated preindustrial levels, primarily from CO2 fertilization, but also in part due to reduced plant heat stress compared to a high CO2 world with no geoengineering. All models show that uniform solar geoengineering in G1 cannot simultaneously return regional and global temperature and hydrologic cycle intensity to preindustrial levels.},

The flux which appears in this relation constitutes, it is argued, a useful diagnostic of the three-dimensional propagation of stationary wave activity. This is illustrated by application to a simple theoretical model of a forced Rossby wave train and to a Northern Hemisphere winter climatology. Results of the latter procedure suggest that the major forcing of the stationary wave field derives from the orographic effects of the Tibetan plateau and from nonorographic effects (diabatic heating and/or interaction with transient eddies) in the western North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans and Siberia. No evidence is found in the data for wave trains of tropical origin; forcing by the orographic effects of the Rocky mountains seems to be of secondary importance.},

Projections of multi-model mean under four different shared socioeconomic pathways were also examined. The results reveal that the majority of models reasonably capture the dominant features of the spatial variations in observed temperature with a pattern correlation typically greater than 0.98, but with large variability across models and regions. In addition, the CMIP6 mean can capture the trends of global surface temperatures shown by the observational data during 1901–1940 (warming), 1941–1970 (cooling) and 1971–2014 (rapid warming). By the end of the 21st century, the global temperature under different scenarios is projected to increase by 1.18 ◦C/100 yr (SSP1-2.6), 3.22 ◦C/100 yr (SSP2-4.5), 5.50 ◦C/100 yr (SSP3-7.0) and 7.20 ◦C/100 yr (SSP5-8.5), with greater warming projected over the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere and weaker warming over the tropics and the southern hemisphere. Results of probability density distributions further indicate that large increases in the frequency and magnitude of warm extremes over the global land may occur in the future.},

abstract = {The Murray-Darling Basin is Australia's food bowl
and home to many iconic water bodies that are
culturally and ecologically highly valued. The
recent Millennium Drought (from mid-1990s to 2009)
was the most severe hydrological drought since
records started in the late 19th century. It
severely impacted on the basin and for many acted as
a wake-up call. To address the ongoing declines in
water resources and environmental conditions and to
prepare the region for climate change, Australia's
Governments are currently attempting to introduce a
new comprehensive, and integrated approach to the
management of the basin's water resources. In this
paper, long-term time series of climate,
hydrological and environmental data are used to
analyze how compounding stresses have gradually
affected the hydrological system and its
services. Major hydroclimatic stresses considered in
this paper include salinity, water use, droughts,
and climate change. Other, more localized or minor
stresses exist (groundwater extraction, farm dams,
afforestation, bush fires, cyanobacterial blooms and
pollutants) and are reviewed more briefly. The
history of water policy and planning shows that
Government actions have been strongly influential on
the basin. A shift in the strategic goals from water
development to the protection and restoration of
environmental assets is noticeable since the mid
1990s. Median climate change projections by 2030
indicate smaller reductions in rainfall and runoff
than those observed during the recent Millennium
Drought, but have a relatively high uncertainty
attached to them. The use of regional approaches to
reduce that uncertainty, such as statistical
downscaling, points to a sizeable decline in
rainfall by the end of the century. Most climate
projections used for planning consider greenhouse
emission scenarios that have smaller global emission
trends than the one observed over the last
decade. Other, 'less optimistic' scenarios have to
be considered for long-term water planning and food
security. Compounding all these stresses, is the
naturally high hydroclimatic variability of this
semi-arid region, that may have been insufficiently
considered during previous water development and
planning efforts. Successful water planning will
need to balance cultural and ecological values with
food production, account for high natural
variability and uncertainty in climate change
projections, learn from past mistakes and be
cognizant of future hydrological changes. (C) 2011

Compositing analysis of stratospheric warming events identifies regional tropospheric precursors, which precede stratospheric warmings.

Prior to vortex displacements the main anomaly sea level pressure center of the tropospheric precursor is located across northwest Eurasia and is associated with the Siberian high.

Here we use snowstorms as a marker to assess the mesoscale fingerprint of climate change, providing a description of potential changes in winter weather event occurrence, character and variability in central and eastern North America under a high anthropogenic emissions pathway. Snowstorms are segmented and tracked using high-resolution, snow water equivalent output from dynamically downscaled simulations which, unlike global climate models, can resolve important mesoscale features such as banded snow. Significant decreases are found in the frequency and size of snowstorms in a pseudo-global warming simulation, including those events that produce the most extreme snowfall accumulations. Early and late boreal winter months show particularly robust proportional decreases in snowstorms and snow water equivalent accumulations. Predicting the impact of climate change on snowstorms is key for future water resource estimates. North American snowstorms are tracked in high-resolution warming simulations and exhibit robust decreases in storm count, snow water equivalent and areal footprint, particularly in shoulder seasons.},

Knowledge of the natural variability of sea ice thickness is therefore critical for its representation in global climate models. Numerical simulations suggest that Arctic ice thickness varies primarily on decadal timescales owing to changes in wind and ocean stresses on the ice, but observations have been unable to provide a synoptic view of sea ice thickness, which is required to validate the model results. Here we use an eight-year time-series of Arctic ice thickness, derived from satellite altimeter measurements of ice freeboard, to determine the mean thickness field and its variability from 65 degrees N to 81.5 degrees N. Our data reveal a high-frequency interannual variability in mean Arctic ice thickness that is dominated by changes in the amount of summer melt, rather than by changes in circulation. Our results suggest that a continued increase in melt season length would lead to further thinning of Arctic sea ice.},

But it remains difficult to assess the likelihood of future changes in the thermohaline circulation, mainly owing to poorly constrained model parameterizations and uncertainties in the response of the climate system to greenhouse warming. Analyses of past abrupt climate changes help to solve these problems. Data and models both suggest that abrupt climate change during the last glaciation originated through changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation in response to small changes in the hydrological cycle. Atmospheric and oceanic responses to these changes were then transmitted globally through a number of feedbacks. The palaeoclimate data and the model results also indicate that the stability of the thermohaline circulation depends on the mean climate state.},

abstract = {Cropping system diversity can help build greater agroecosystem resilience by suppressing insect, weed, and disease pressures while also mitigating effects of extreme and more variable weather. Despite the potential benefits of cropping systems diversity, few farmers in the US Corn Belt use diverse rotations. This study examines factors that may influence farmers' decisions to use more diversified crop rotations in the US Corn Belt through a parallel convergent mixed methods approach, using a multi-level analysis of Corn Belt farmer survey data (n = 4,778) and in-depth interviews (n = 159). Analyses were conducted to answer questions regarding what factors influence farmers' use of extended crop rotations in intensive corn-based cropping systems and to explore whether farmers in the Corn Belt might use extended crop rotations in response to climatic changes. Findings suggest that path dependency associated with the intensive corn-based cropping system in the region limits farmers' ability to integrate more diverse crop rotations. However, farmers in more diversified watersheds, those who farm marginal land, and those with livestock are more likely to use extended rotations. Additionally, farmers who currently use more diverse rotations are also more likely to plan to use crop rotations as a climate change adaptation strategy. If more diverse cropping systems are desired to reduce climate risks, in addition to reducing the negative impacts associated with industrial agricultural production, then further efforts must be made to facilitate more diverse crop rotations in the U.S. Corn Belt. This may be achieved by adjusting policy and economic incentives that presently discourage cropping system diversity in the region.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently attracted great attention in geoscience due to their ability to capture non-linear system behavior and extract predictive spatiotemporal patterns. Given their black-box nature however, and the importance of prediction explainability, methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are gaining popularity as a means to explain the CNN decision-making strategy. Here, we establish an intercomparison of some of the most popular XAI methods and investigate their fidelity in explaining CNN decisions for geoscientific applications. Our goal is to raise awareness of the theoretical limitations of these methods and gain insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses to help guide best practices. The considered XAI methods are first applied to an idealized attribution benchmark, where the ground truth of explanation of the network is known a priori, to help objectively assess their performance. Secondly, we apply XAI to a climate-related prediction setting, namely to explain a CNN that is trained to predict the number of atmospheric rivers in daily snapshots of climate simulations. Our results highlight several important issues of XAI methods (e.g., gradient shattering, inability to distinguish the sign of attribution, ignorance to zero input) that have previously been overlooked in our field and, if not considered cautiously, may lead to a distorted picture of the CNN decision-making strategy. We envision that our analysis will motivate further investigation into XAI fidelity and will help towards a cautious implementation of XAI in geoscience, which can lead to further exploitation of CNNs and deep learning for prediction problems.},

abstract = {Closure of the Earth's energy budget relies on strong aerosol cooling since 1998, if the same feedbacks apply for anthropogenic and natural variability. An analysis of climate model simulations suggests that these feedbacks are instead distinct. The Earth's energy budget for the past four decades can now be closed1, and it supports anthropogenic greenhouse forcing as the cause for climate warming. However, closure depends on invoking an unrealistically large increase in aerosol cooling2 during the so-called global warming hiatus since the late 1990s (refs 3,4) that was due partly to tropical Pacific Ocean cooling5,6,7. The difficulty with this closure lies in the assumption that the same climate feedback applies to both anthropogenic warming and natural cooling. Here we analyse climate model simulations with and without anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, and show that top-of-the-atmosphere radiation and global mean surface temperature are much less tightly coupled for natural decadal variability than for the greenhouse-gas-induced response, implying distinct climate feedback between anthropogenic warming and natural variability. In addition, we identify a phase difference between top-of-the-atmosphere radiation and global mean surface temperature such that ocean heat uptake tends to slow down during the surface warming hiatus. This result deviates from existing energy theory but we find that it is broadly consistent with observations. Our study highlights the importance of developing metrics that distinguish anthropogenic change from natural variations to attribute climate variability and to estimate climate sensitivity from observations.},

abstract = {To assess climate sensitivity from Earth radiation
observations of limited duration and observed sea
surface temperatures (SSTs) requires a closed and
therefore global domain, equilibrium between the
fields, and robust methods of dealing with
noise. Noise arises from natural variability in the
atmosphere and observational noise in precessing
satellite observations. This paper explores the
meaning of results that use only the tropical
region. We compute correlations and regressions
between tropical SSTs and top of-atmosphere (TOA)
longwave, shortwave and net radiation using a
variety of methods to test robustness of
results. The main changes in SSTs throughout the
tropics are associated with El Nino Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) events in which the dominant
changes in energy into an atmospheric column come
from ocean heat exchange through evaporation, latent
heat release in precipitation, and redistribution of
that heat through atmospheric winds. These changes
can be an order of magnitude larger than the net TOA
radiation changes, and their effects are
teleconnected globally, and especially into the
subtropics. Atmospheric model results are explored
and found to be consistent with observations. From
1985 to 1999 the largest perturbation in TOA
radiative fluxes was from the eruption of Mount
Pinatubo and clearly models which do not include
that forcing will not simulate the
effects. Consequently, regressions of radiation with
SSTs in the tropics may have nothing to say about
climate sensitivity. Citation: Trenberth, K. E.,

abstract = {Central equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature
(SST) anomaly is a critical predictor of basin-wide
oceanographic and atmospheric effects of the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. We
employ two geochemical thermometers measured on
coralline aragonite to reconstruct an independent
proxy-based measure of central equatorial Pacific
sea surface temperature anomaly. In addition, we
assess the observational error associated with
extraction of large-scale SST anomalies from
delta(18)O and Sr/Ca measurements. On the basis of
paired data for the 1981-1987 period, RMS error for
the estimation of SST from Kiritimati coral
delta(18)O is about 0.4 degrees C, assuming no
seawater delta(18)O influence; for Sr/Ca, the
observational error is about 0.5 degrees C. Singular
spectrum analysis of the delta(18)O time series
suggests that 1/3 of the variance is explained by
SST anomaly and that this variance may be separated
from other signals in the frequency domain. The
interannual component of the delta(18)O record
shares 70{\%} variance with the interannual component
of local SST anomaly estimates (rho=-0.84) and
correlates as highly with NINO3 region (150 degrees
W-90 degrees W, 5 degrees N-5 degrees S) SST anomaly
estimates; comparison of annual averages of the
delta(18)O data with analyzed SST for 55 years
suggests that the error in deriving annually
averaged SST anomalies at Kiritimati is about 0.4
degrees C. A global SST correlation analysis
suggests significant correlation with the rest of
the Pacific Basin and the tropical Indian and
Atlantic sectors. The ocean-wide level of
correlation achieved using the coral data is
indistinguishable from that achieved using the NINO3
SST anomaly index and suggests that a few
well-located coral reconstructions with low
observational error may be sufficient to reconstruct
the global SST anomaly field associated with ENSO
activity.},

abstract = {The tendency for more frequent El Nino events and
fewer La Nina events since the late 1970's has been
linked to decadal changes in climate throughout the
Pacific basin. Aspects of the most recent warming in
the tropical Pacific from 1990 to 1995, which are
connected to but not synonymous with El Nino, are
unprecedented in the climate record of the past 113
years. There is a distinction between El Nino (EN),
the Southern Oscillation (SO) in the atmosphere, and
ENSO, where the two are strongly linked, that
emerges clearly on decadal time scales. In the
traditional El Nino region, sea surface temperature
anomalies (SSTAs) have waxed and waned, while SSTAs
in the central equatorial Pacific, which are better
linked to the SO, remained positive from 1990 to
June 1995. We carry out several statistical tests to
assess the likelihood that the recent behavior of
the SO is part of a natural decadal-timescale
variation. One test fits an autoregressive-moving
average (ARMA) model to a measure of the SO given by
the first hundred years of the pressures at Darwin,
Australia, beginning in 1882. Both the recent trend
for more ENSO events since 1976 and,the prolonged
1990-1995 ENSO event are unexpected given the
previous record, with a probability of occurrence
about once in 2,000 years. This opens up the
possibility that the ENSO changes may be partly
caused by the observed increases in greenhouse

abstract = {The intensification of extreme precipitation under anthropogenic forcing is robustly projected by global climate models, but highly challenging to detect in the observational record. Large internal variability distorts this anthropogenic signal. Models produce diverse magnitudes of precipitation response to anthropogenic forcing, largely due to differing schemes for parameterizing subgrid-scale processes. Meanwhile, multiple global observational datasets of daily precipitation exist, developed using varying techniques and inhomogeneously sampled data in space and time. Previous attempts to detect human influence on extreme precipitation have not incorporated model uncertainty, and have been limited to specific regions and observational datasets. Using machine learning methods that can account for these uncertainties and capable of identifying the time evolution of the spatial patterns, we find a physically interpretable anthropogenic signal that is detectable in all global observational datasets. Machine learning efficiently generates multiple lines of evidence supporting detection of an anthropogenic signal in global extreme precipitation. Climate models project an intensification of extreme precipitation under climate change, but this effect is difficult to detect in the observational record. Here, the authors show that a physically interpretable anthropogenic impact on extreme precipitation is detectable in global observational data sets.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to assess the determinants of hurricane evacuation behavior of North Carolina coastal households during Hurricane Bonnie and a future hypothetical hurricane. We use the data from a telephone survey of North Carolina coastal residents. Hypothetical questions are used to assess whether respondents will evacuate and where in the case of a future hurricane with varying intensities. We examine the social, economic, and risk factors that affect the decisions to evacuate and whether to go to a shelter or motel/hotel relative to other destinations. The most important predictor of evacuation is storm intensity. Households are more likely to evacuate when given evacuation orders, when they perceive a flood risk, and when they live in mobile homes. Households who own pets are less likely to evacuate. Non-white households, pet owners and those with more education are less likely to go to either a motel/hotel or shelter, preferring instead to stay with friends or family. {\textcopyright} 2001 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Here we report an analysis of observational data over the past 40 years, showing a dipole mode in the Indian Ocean: a pattern of internal variability with anomalously low sea surface temperatures off Sumatra and high sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean, with accompanying wind and precipitation anomalies. The spatio-temporal links between sea surface temperatures and winds reveal a strong coupling through the precipitation field and ocean dynamics. This air–sea interaction process is unique and inherent in the Indian Ocean, and is shown to be independent of the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation. The discovery of this dipole mode that accounts for about 12{\%} of the sea surface temperature variability in the Indian Ocean—and, in its active years, also causes severe rainfall in eastern Africa and droughts in Indonesia—brightens the prospects for a long-term forecast of rainfall anomalies in the affected countries.},

abstract = {The use of altimeter data in the polar regions has previously been limited by the presence of permanent and seasonal ice cover. Changes in the radar echo shape received by the altimeter over sea ice, as compared with the open ocean, cause problems in the on-board estimates of surface height, making the data unusable. The majority of noise on the signal can be reduced by retracking the full waveform data set (WAP). Careful quality control is applied to ensure that only those return echoes from which accurate height measurements can be obtained are retained. Consideration of possible backscattering mechanisms from ice and water, and comparisons with imagery, suggest that the specular waveforms typically found in altimeter data over sea ice originate from regions of open water or new thin ice exposed within the altimeter footprint. However, diffuse waveforms similar to those found in ice free seas have been observed in areas of consolidated ice, and may be used to measure ice freeboard. Until recently, even retracked heights contained substantial residual errors due to the interaction of the on-board tracking system with the complex return echoes over sea ice. Software simulation of the tracking system has led to the development of new ground processing algorithms, which further reduce the short wavelength ({\~{}}26 km) noise, from 30-50 cm to around 7 cm. This provides, for the first time in ice covered seas, the capability for accurate mean sea surface generation, measurement of tidal and oceanographic signals and determination of sea ice freeboard. The authors present the results of comparisons of sea surface height variability from ERS-2 radar altimetry in the Arctic with the output from a high resolution Arctic Ocean circulation model},

abstract = {Changes in subseasonal temperature variability are linked with the altered probability of weather extremes and have important impacts on society and ecological systems. Earlier studies based on observations up to 2014 have shown a general decrease in subseasonal temperature variability over Northern Hemisphere extratropical land. However, these changes have been confined to specific regions and seasons, have limited statistical significance and human influence is yet to be determined. Here we show using up-to-date observations and climate model simulations that a human fingerprint, or pattern of change, in subseasonal variability has recently emerged over the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. The fingerprint features decreased near-surface air temperature variability over land in the high-northern latitudes in autumn, further extending into mid-latitudes in winter. Using large ensembles of single-forcing model experiments, we attribute the pattern of reduced temperature variability primarily to increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, with anthropogenic aerosols playing a secondary role. Our results reveal that human influence is now detectable in hemispheric-wide day-to-day temperature variability and motivates research into the impacts of reduced temperature volatility on societal and ecological systems. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for the observed decrease in subseasonal temperature variability in the northern extratropics, according to an attribution analysis using a large ensemble of climate model simulations.},

animal events that take place at specific times each
year (phenology) should play an important role in
monitoring mid-latitude global changes. At least
three problems related to the detection of biosphere
changes could be investigated using this
information. Firstly, the technique can be
generalized from the local to global
scale. Secondly, an integrated approach could be
developed to represent biome diversity
effectively. Lastly, physical mechanisms responsible
for the events can be deduced in order to
incorporate the phenological information into
global-scale models, and detect changes in related
environmental factors. With these goals in mind,
regional phenological data collection networks were
initiated in eastern North America during the early
1960s, using cloned lilacs and several species of
honeysuckle. This paper reviews research projects
which address the problems outlined above, using
first leaf data (associated with spring green-up or
''green wave'' in mid-latitudes) gathered from these
networks. The results of such studies in North
America have demonstrated the potential of phenology
as an efficient monitor of global change throughout
mid-latitude regions. Future research efforts will
concentrate on the development of a coordinated
strategy to link phenological information from
satellites, indicator plants (such as the lilac),

abstract = {In the early twenty-first century, satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi-model ensemble. Because observations and coupled model simulations do not have the same phasing of natural internal variability, such decadal differences in simulated and observed warming rates invariably occur. Here we analyse global-mean tropospheric temperatures from satellites and climate model simulations to examine whether warming rate differences over the satellite era can be explained by internal climate variability alone. We find that in the last two decades of the twentieth century, differences between modelled and observed tropospheric temperature trends are broadly consistent with internal variability. Over most of the early twenty-first century, however, model tropospheric warming is substantially larger than observed; warming rate differences are generally outside the range of trends arising from internal variability. The probability that multi-decadal internal variability fully explains the asymmetry between the late twentieth and early twenty-first century results is low (between zero and about 9{\%}). It is also unlikely that this asymmetry is due to the combined effects of internal variability and a model error in climate sensitivity. We conclude that model overestimation of tropospheric warming in the early twenty-first century is partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations.},

Persistent Ural blocking anomalies in November are associated with a warm Arctic/cold Siberia pattern and increased upward planetary waves entering the stratosphere, leading to a warming of the polar vortex. This stratospheric response then propagates in the troposphere, leading to increased occurrence of the negative North Atlantic Oscillation in December and January. In contrast, simulations with perturbed Barents-Kara sea ice and Siberian snow in November do not reproduce a significant atmospheric response. In simulations including a slab ocean, the Ural blocking induces Barents-Kara sea ice and Siberia snow anomalies that resemble composite analyses from observations. These results highlight Ural blocking variability in November as a robust driver of early-winter stratospheric warming while questioning causality between sea ice/snow and Ural blocking anomalies.},

abstract = {Northern midlatitudes, over central Eurasia in particular, have experienced frequent severe winters in recent decades1–3. A remote influence of Arctic sea-ice loss has been suggested4–14; however, the importance of this connection remains controversial because of discrepancies among modelling and between modelling and observational studies15–17. Here, using a hybrid analysis of observations and multi-model large ensembles from seven atmospheric general circulation models, we examine the cause of these differences. While all models capture the observed structure of the forced surface temperature response to sea-ice loss in the Barents–Kara Seas—including Eurasian cooling—we show that its magnitude is systematically underestimated. Owing to the varying degrees of this underestimation of sea-ice-forced signal, the signal-to-noise ratio differs markedly. Correcting this underestimation reconciles the discrepancy between models and observations, leading to the conclusion that {\~{}}44{\%} of the central Eurasian cooling trend for 1995–2014 is attributable to sea-ice loss in the Barents–Kara Seas. Our results strongly suggest that anthropogenic forcing has significantly amplified the probability of severe winter occurrence in central Eurasia via enhanced melting of the Barents–Kara sea ice. The difference in underestimation of signal-to-noise ratio between models therefore calls for careful experimental design and interpretation for regional climate change attribution.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new eight-member ensemble of ocean reanalyses spanning nearly 200 years from 1815 to 2013 generated using the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation system with sparse observational input (SODAsi) to explore long-term changes in the oceans. The eight ensemble members assimilate surface temperature observations and use surface boundary conditions from an atmospheric reanalysis that is loosely coupled to the ocean reanalysis. Both surface and subsurface quantities, such as dynamic height and heat content, show a broad spectrum of variability. Surface temperature trends from 1815 to 2013 are positive in most regions, with some important exceptions; the central Tropical Pacific, around Antarctica, and in the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio extension regions all show cooling trends. A near-global average shows warming of about 0.8°C over the full period, with most of the warming occurring after 1920. There is pronounced multidecadal variability in both the midlatitude and tropical oceans. In the North Atlantic Ocean, temperature variability is highly correlated with the meridional overturning stream function, with the largest correlation occurring when the stream function is advanced by 9 years. Trends of upper ocean heat content and dynamic height from the 1950s onward compare well with previously published values. Globally averaged heat content of the upper 700 m shows a nearly linear rise after the 1920s, requiring a net downward surface heat flux increase of 0.47 W m−2 into the ocean. This is close to published estimates of the increased flux required to explain the heat content increase from 1971 to 2010.},

It is shown that anomalous sea ice conditions accounted for virtually all of the estimated Arctic amplification in surface-based warming over the Arctic Ocean, and furthermore they accounted for a large fraction of Arctic amplification occurring over the high-latitude land between 60N and the Arctic Ocean. Sea ice loss did not appreciably contribute to observed 2007 land temperature warmth equatorward of 60N. Likewise, the observed warming of the free atmosphere attributable to sea ice loss is confined to Arctic latitudes, and is vertically confined to the lowest 1000 m. The results further highlight a strong seasonality of the temperature response to the 2007 sea ice loss. A weak signal of Arctic amplification in surface based warming is found during boreal summer, whereas a dramatically stronger signal is shown to develop during early autumn that persisted through December even as sea ice coverage approached its climatological values in response to the polar night.},

abstract = {Temporal differences among fossil pollen samples
from eastern North America provide a measure of the
amount of climatic change that occurred on a broad
spatial scale since the last glacial maximum (21,000
cal yr BP). Square-chord distances (SCDs) quantify
the difference between pollen samples, and, thus,
represent the potential magnitude of climatic change
underlying the pollen record. The magnitude varied
significantly among time scales with small changes
common at centennial to millennial scales and large
changes common at multi-millennial (i.e. orbital)
scales. SCDs measured across 3000-yr intervals
averaged 0.20, and often exceeded the maximum
difference expected from samples collected within
the same biome (0.15). SCDs across individual
millennia were smaller and averaged 0.08. SCDs
across the millennia at the beginning
(13,000-12,000cal yr BP) and end (12,000-11,000 cat
yr BP) of the Younger Dryas chronozone
(12,900-11,600 cal yr BP), however, averaged 0.20
and 0.18, respectively. These rapid step changes,
large at sub-millennial scales, equal about 5-25{\%} of
the total glacial-interglacial transition. Large
magnitude progressive changes in insolation, ice
sheet extent, and atmospheric composition parallel
the dominant trends in the SCD data, which show that
progressive change comprises the first-order
climatic pattern of the Holocene rather than stable
or oscillatory patterns. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

abstract = {The "Dust Bowl" drought of the 1930s was highly
unusual for North America, deviating from the
typical pattern forced by "La Nina" with the maximum
drying in the central and northern Plains, warm
temperature anomalies across almost the entire
continent, and widespread dust storms. General
circulation models (GCMs), forced by sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) from the 1930s, produce a
drought, but one that is centered in southwestern
North America and without the warming centered in
the middle of the continent. Here, we show that the
inclusion of forcing from human land degradation
during the period, in addition to the anomalous
SSTs, is necessary to reproduce the anomalous
features of the Dust Bowl drought. The degradation
over the Great Plains is represented in the GCM as a
reduction in vegetation cover and the addition of a
soil dust aerosol source, both consequences of crop
failure. As a result of land surface feedbacks, the
simulation of the drought is much improved when the
new dust aerosol and vegetation boundary conditions
are included. Vegetation reductions explain the high
temperature anomaly over the northern U.S., and the
dust aerosols intensify the drought and move it
northward of the purely ocean-forced drought
pattern. When both factors are included in the model
simulations, the precipitation and temperature
anomalies are of similar magnitude and in a similar
location compared with the
observations. Human-induced land degradation is
likely to have not only contributed to the dust
storms of the 1930s but also amplified the drought,
and these together turned a modest SST-forced
drought into one of the worst environmental
disasters the U.S. has experienced.},

Design: A four-part online survey was administered.    Participants were provided an error cone graphic and one of three experimental potential for damaging winds graphics. Hurricane knowledge was also measured.    Subjects: Two hundred eighty-six individuals initially responded to the survey. A subset of the sample was used for analysis (N = 203, with 130 responding to questions in all four parts). The average age was 41.97 (SD 12.97) with a range from 18 to 75. The reduced sample was 56.7 percent female and 43.3 percent male.    Results: Responses were significantly different between those receiving the potential for damaging winds graphic and both other graphics. The addition of the error cone did not significantly change decision making. Perceived helpfulness of the forecast graphic increased with the addition of the track, but similarly, the addition of the error cone did not contribute significantly (means = 5.91, 7.78, 8.09). A majority of respondents answered five of the six hurricane knowledge questions correctly (62.1-79 percent). The lowest percentage knew what ingredients hurricanes needed to form (36.3 percent).    Conclusions: Track information significantly altered participants' perceptions of risk from damaging winds, but the error cone did not. Hurricane knowledge was good, with misconceptions existing regarding the effectiveness of taping windows and the meaning of the term “major hurricane.” Understanding of the two forecast graphics was also good.},

abstract = {A 1360-yr control run from a global coupled climate
model (the Parallel Climate Model) is analyzed. it
simulates "megadroughts" in the southwestern United
States and Indian monsoon regions. The megadroughts
represent extreme events of naturally occurring
multidecadal precipitation variations linked to the
dominant pattern of multidecadal SST variability in
the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Gaining insight into
the occurrence of megadroughts thus requires an
understanding of the mechanism that is producing
this multidecadal SST variability. Analysis of the
model variability shows that the mechanism involves
atmosphere-ocean and tropical-midlatitude
interactions, with a crucial element being
wind-forced ocean Rossby waves near 20 degrees N and
25 degrees S in the Pacific whose transit times set
the decadal time scale. At the western boundary, the
Rossby waves reflect into the equatorial Pacific to
affect thermocline depth. The resulting
feedbacks. involving surface temperature. winds, and
the strength of the subtropical cells, produce SST
anomalies and associated precipitation and
convective heating anomalies. These anomalies are
associated with atmospheric Rossby waves and
resulting anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns
in the midlatitude North and South
Pacific. Consequent surface wind stress anomalies
extend equatorward into the Tropics and help force
ocean Rossby waves near 20 degrees N and 25 degrees
S. and so on. Though there are some common elements
with various ENSO processes, this decadal mechanism
is physically distinct mainly because the surface
wind stress anomalies near 20 degrees N and 25
degrees S supplement the wave reflections at the
eastern boundary to force the ocean Rossby waves
that provide the decadal time scale. These wind
anomalies are closely tied to the anomalous
midlatitude atmospheric circulation that is a
product of teleconnections from the multidecadal SST
and tropical convective heating
anomalies. themselves linked to precipitation
anomalies in the southwestern United States and
south Asia associated with megadroughts.},

abstract = {Historical temperature measurements are the basis of global climate datasets like HadCRUT4. This dataset contains many missing values, particularly for periods before the mid-twentieth century, although recent years are also incomplete. Here we demonstrate that artificial intelligence can skilfully fill these observational gaps when combined with numerical climate model data. We show that recently developed image inpainting techniques perform accurate monthly reconstructions via transfer learning using either 20CR (Twentieth-Century Reanalysis) or the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) experiments. The resulting global annual mean temperature time series exhibit high Pearson correlation coefficients (≥0.9941) and low root mean squared errors (≤0.0547 °C) as compared with the original data. These techniques also provide advantages relative to state-of-the-art kriging interpolation and principal component analysis-based infilling. When applied to HadCRUT4, our method restores a missing spatial pattern of the documented El Ni{\~{n}}o from July 1877. With respect to the global mean temperature time series, a HadCRUT4 reconstruction by our method points to a cooler nineteenth century, a less apparent hiatus in the twenty-first century, an even warmer 2016 being the warmest year on record and a stronger global trend between 1850 and 2018 relative to previous estimates. We propose image inpainting as an approach to reconstruct missing climate information and thereby reduce uncertainties and biases in climate records. An artificial intelligence-based method may infill gaps in historical temperature data more effectively than conventional techniques. Application of this method reveals a stronger global warming trend between 1850 and 2018 than estimated previously.},

Inter-comparisons are done for the periods of overlap from 2003 to 2013. Results show that ICESat sea ice is thicker than APP-x and PIOMAS overall, particularly along the north coast of Greenland and Canadian Archipelago. The relative differences of APP-x and PIOMAS with ICESat are −0.48 m and −0.31 m, respectively. APP-x underestimates thickness relative to CryoSat-2, with a mean difference of −0.19 m. The biases for APP-x, PIOMAS, and CryoSat-2 relative to IceBridge thicknesses are 0.18 m, 0.18 m, and 0.29 m. The mean difference between SMOS and CryoSat-2 for 0{\~{}}1 m thick ice is 0.13 m in March and −0.24 m in October. All satellite-retrieved ice thickness products and PIOMAS overestimate the thickness of thin ice (1 m or less) compared to IceBridge for which SMOS has the smallest bias (0.26 m).

However, unpacking the contribution of different environmental stressors remains elusive in large-scale observational settings in part because of the lack of an extensive long-term network of soil moisture measurements and the common seasonal concurrence of droughts and heat waves. In this study, we link state-of-the-art land surface model data and fine-scale weather information with a long panel of county-level yields for six major US crops (1981-2017) to unpack their historical and future climatic drivers. To this end, we develop a statistical approach that flexibly characterizes the distinct intra-seasonal yield sensitivities to high-frequency fluctuations of soil moisture and temperature. In contrast with previous statistical evidence, we directly elicit an important role of water stress in explaining historical yields. However, our models project the direct effect of temperature - which we interpret as heat stress - remains the primary climatic driver of future yields under climate change.},

All three models have weak trends in their surface winds and one model lacks ice dynamics altogether, implying that trends in the atmosphere or ice circulation are not necessary to produce a relatively high rate of thinning over the central Arctic or a thickness change that increases with the initial thickness.

abstract = {A common approach to sampling the space of a prediction is the generation of an ensemble of potential outcomes, where the ensemble's distribution reveals the statistical structure of the prediction space. For example, the US National Hurricane Center generates multiple day predictions for a storm's path, size, and wind speed, and then uses a Monte Carlo approach to sample this prediction into a large ensemble of potential storm outcomes. Various forms of summary visualizations are generated from such an ensemble, often using spatial spread to indicate its statistical characteristics. However, studies have shown that changes in the size of such summary glyphs, representing changes in the uncertainty of the prediction, are frequently confounded with other attributes of the phenomenon, such as its size or strength. In addition, simulation ensembles typically encode multivariate information, which can be difficult or confusing to include in a summary display. This problem can be overcome by directly displaying the ensemble as a set of annotated trajectories, however this solution will not be effective if ensembles are densely overdrawn or structurally disorganized. We propose to overcome these difficulties by selectively sampling the original ensemble, constructing a smaller representative and spatially well organized ensemble. This can be drawn directly as a set of paths that implicitly reveals the underlying spatial uncertainty distribution of the prediction. Since this approach does not use a visual channel to encode uncertainty, additional information can more easily be encoded in the display without leading to visual confusion. To demonstrate our argument, we describe the development of a visualization for ensembles of tropical cyclone forecast tracks, explaining how their spatial and temporal predictions, as well as other crucial storm characteristics such as size and intensity, can be clearly revealed. We verify the effectiveness of this visualization approach through a cognitive study exploring how storm damage estimates are affected by the density of tracks drawn, and by the presence or absence of annotating information on storm size and intensity.},

abstract = {We document the development and simulation characteristics of the next generation modeling system for seasonal to decadal prediction and projection at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). SPEAR (Seamless System for Prediction and EArth System Research) is built from component models recently developed at GFDL—the AM4 atmosphere model, MOM6 ocean code, LM4 land model, and SIS2 sea ice model. The SPEAR models are specifically designed with attributes needed for a prediction model for seasonal to decadal time scales, including the ability to run large ensembles of simulations with available computational resources. For computational speed SPEAR uses a coarse ocean resolution of approximately 1.0° (with tropical refinement). SPEAR can use differing atmospheric horizontal resolutions ranging from 1° to 0.25°. The higher atmospheric resolution facilitates improved simulation of regional climate and extremes. SPEAR is built from the same components as the GFDL CM4 and ESM4 models but with design choices geared toward seasonal to multidecadal physical climate prediction and projection. We document simulation characteristics for the time mean climate, aspects of internal variability, and the response to both idealized and realistic radiative forcing change. We describe in greater detail one focus of the model development process that was motivated by the importance of the Southern Ocean to the global climate system. We present sensitivity tests that document the influence of the Antarctic surface heat budget on Southern Ocean ventilation and deep global ocean circulation. These findings were also useful in the development processes for the GFDL CM4 and ESM4 models.},

abstract = {Forecast graphics depicting a hurricane track and uncertainty cone have become pervasive in the communication of hurricane risk. This study examined whether the effect of hurricane tracks on risk perception is influenced by the consistency and optimistic bias. Specifically, it focused on the differences between forecasts that remain consistent compared to those that veer away for a forecast period. To answer the research question, this study conducted online surveys in which respondents from two coastal universities were asked risk perception questions based on a series of forecast graphics. Other variables measured included dispositional optimism, general hurricane risk perception, and hurricane information use. Optimistic bias was calculated from two of the risk perception questions. Results did not indicate strong support for an influence of optimistic bias or changing forecast track on risk perception. There was limited evidence that a veering track scenario may lead to differences in risk judgments about another location, but most measures of personal risk estimation were not influenced by the track. Dispositional optimism was not related to optimistic bias or many of the risk perception variables tested, including general hurricane risk perception. There did appear to be an interaction between track scenario and optimistic bias with more relationships being significant among those who received the consistent track scenario.},

abstract = {Cloud phase improvements in a state-of-the-art climate model produce a large 1.5 K increase in equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS, the surface warming in response to instantaneously doubled CO2) via extratropical shortwave cloud feedbacks. Here we show that the same model improvements produce only a small surface warming increase in a realistic 21st century emissions scenario. The small 21st century warming increase is attributed to extratropical ocean heat uptake. Southern Ocean mean-state circulation takes up heat while a slowdown in North Atlantic circulation acts as a feedback to slow surface warming. Persistent heat uptake by extratropical oceans implies that extratropical cloud biases may not be as important to 21st century warming as biases in other regions. Observational constraints on cloud phase and shortwave radiation that produce a large ECS increase do not imply large changes in 21st century warming.},

@article{Aaron-Morrison2017,
abstract = {In 2016, the dominant greenhouse gases released into Earth's atmosphere-carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide-continued to increase and reach new record highs. The 3.5 ± 0.1 ppm rise in global annual mean carbon dioxide from 2015 to 2016 was the largest annual increase observed in the 58-year measurement record. The annual global average carbon dioxide concentration at Earth's surface surpassed 400 ppm (402.9 ± 0.1 ppm) for the first time in the modern atmospheric measurement record and in ice core records dating back as far as 800000 years. One of the strongest El Ni{\~{n}}o events since at least 1950 dissipated in spring, and a weak La Ni{\~{n}}a evolved later in the year. Owing at least in part to the combination of El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions early in the year and a long-term upward trend, Earth's surface observed record warmth for a third consecutive year, albeit by a much slimmer margin than by which that record was set in 2015. Above Earth's surface, the annual lower troposphere temperature was record high according to all datasets analyzed, while the lower stratospheric temperature was record low according to most of the in situ and satellite datasets. Several countries, including Mexico and India, reported record high annual temperatures while many others observed near-record highs. A week-long heat wave at the end of April over the northern and eastern Indian peninsula, with temperatures surpassing 44°C, contributed to a water crisis for 330 million people and to 300 fatalities. In the Arctic the 2016 land surface temperature was 2.0°C above the 1981-2010 average, breaking the previous record of 2007, 2011, and 2015 by 0.8°C, representing a 3.5°C increase since the record began in 1900. The increasing temperatures have led to decreasing Arctic sea ice extent and thickness. On 24 March, the sea ice extent at the end of the growth season saw its lowest maximum in the 37-year satellite record, tying with 2015 at 7.2{\%} below the 1981-2010 average. The September 2016 Arctic sea ice minimum extent tied with 2007 for the second lowest value on record, 33{\%} lower than the 1981-2010 average. Arctic sea ice cover remains relatively young and thin, making it vulnerable to continued extensive melt. The mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet, which has the capacity to contribute ∼7 m to sea level rise, reached a record low value. The onset of its surface melt was the second earliest, after 2012, in the 37-year satellite record. Sea surface temperature was record high at the global scale, surpassing the previous record of 2015 by about 0.01°C. The global sea surface temperature trend for the 21st centuryto-date of +0.162°C decade-1 is much higher than the longer term 1950-2016 trend of +0.100°C decade-1. Global annual mean sea level also reached a new record high, marking the sixth consecutive year of increase. Global annual ocean heat content saw a slight drop compared to the record high in 2015. Alpine glacier retreat continued around the globe, and preliminary data indicate that 2016 is the 37th consecutive year of negative annual mass balance. Across the Northern Hemisphere, snow cover for each month from February to June was among its four least extensive in the 47-year satellite record. Continuing a pattern below the surface, record high temperatures at 20-m depth were measured at all permafrost observatories on the North Slope of Alaska and at the Canadian observatory on northernmost Ellesmere Island. In the Antarctic, record low monthly surface pressures were broken at many stations, with the southern annular mode setting record high index values in March and June. Monthly high surface pressure records for August and November were set at several stations. During this period, record low daily and monthly sea ice extents were observed, with the November mean sea ice extent more than 5 standard deviations below the 1981-2010 average. These record low sea ice values contrast sharply with the record high values observed during 2012-14. Over the region, springtime Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion was less severe relative to the 1991-2006 average, but ozone levels were still low compared to pre-1990 levels. Closer to the equator, 93 named tropical storms were observed during 2016, above the 1981-2010 average of 82, but fewer than the 101 storms recorded in 2015. Three basins-the North Atlantic, and eastern and western North Pacific-experienced above-normal activity in 2016. The Australian basin recorded its least active season since the beginning of the satellite era in 1970. Overall, four tropical cyclones reached the Saffir-Simpson category 5 intensity level. The strong El Ni{\~{n}}o at the beginning of the year that transitioned to a weak La Ni{\~{n}}a contributed to enhanced precipitation variability around the world. Wet conditions were observed throughout the year across southern South America, causing repeated heavy flooding in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Wetter-than-usual conditions were also observed for eastern Europe and central Asia, alleviating the drought conditions of 2014 and 2015 in southern Russia. In the United States, California had its first wetter-than-average year since 2012, after being plagued by drought for several years. Even so, the area covered by drought in 2016 at the global scale was among the largest in the post-1950 record. For each month, at least 12{\%} of land surfaces experienced severe drought conditions or worse, the longest such stretch in the record. In northeastern Brazil, drought conditions were observed for the fifth consecutive year, making this the longest drought on record in the region. Dry conditions were also observed in western Bolivia and Peru; it was Bolivia's worst drought in the past 25 years. In May, with abnormally warm and dry conditions already prevailing over western Canada for about a year, the human-induced Fort McMurray wildfire burned nearly 590000 hectares and became the costliest disaster in Canadian history, with {\$}3 billion (U.S. dollars) in insured losses.},

abstract = {The causes and global context of the North American
drought between 1998 and 2004 are examined using
atmospheric reanalyses and ensembles of atmosphere
model simulations variously forced by global SSTs or
tropical Pacific SSTs alone. The drought divides
into two distinct time intervals. Between 1998 and
2002 it coincided with a persistent La Ni (n) over
tildea-like state in the tropical Pacific, a cool
tropical troposphere, poleward shifted jet streams,
and, in the zonal mean, eddy-driven descent in
midlatitudes. During the winters reduced
precipitation over North America in the climate
models was sustained by anomalous subsidence and
reductions of moisture convergence by the stationary
flow and transient eddies. During the summers
reductions of evaporation and mean flow moisture
convergence drove the precipitation reduction, while
transient eddies acted diffusively to oppose
this. During these years the North American drought
fitted into a global pattern of circulation and
hydroclimate anomalies with noticeable zonal and
hemispheric symmetry. During the later period of
the drought, from 2002 to 2004, weak El Ni (n) over
tildeo conditions prevailed and, while the global
climate adjusted accordingly, western North America
remained, uniquely among midlatitude regions, in
drought. The ensemble mean of the climate model
simulations did not simulate the continuation of the
drought in these years, suggesting that the
termination of the drought was largely unpredictable
in terms of global ocean conditions. The global
context of the most recent, turn of the century,
drought is compared to the five prior persistent
North American droughts in the instrumental record
from the mid-nineteenth century on. A classic La Ni
(n) over tildea pattern of ocean temperature in the
Pacific is common to all. A cold Indian Ocean, also
typical of La Ni (n) over tildea, is common to all
five prior droughts, but not the most recent
one. Except in southern South America the global
pattern of precipitation anomalies of the turn of
the century drought is similar to that during the
five prior droughts. These comparisons suggest that
the earlier period of this most recent drought is
the latest in a series of multiyear droughts forced
by persistent changes in tropical Pacific Ocean
temperatures. Warm tropical North Atlantic Ocean
temperatures may play a secondary role.},

The proposed approach estimates the response to Arctic sea ice loss with low-latitude ocean temperatures fixed and vice versa. The sea ice response includes a high northern latitude easterly zonal wind response, an equatorward shift of the eddy-driven jet, a weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex, an anticyclonic sea level pressure anomaly over coastal Eurasia, a cyclonic sea level pressure anomaly over the North Pacific, and increased wintertime precipitation over the west coast of North America.

A prerequisite is however for the model to be able to explain itself, e.g. by highlighting which input features it uses to support its prediction. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is a technique that brings such explainability and scales to potentially highly complex deep neural networks. It operates by propagating the prediction backward in the neural network, using a set of purposely designed propagation rules. In this chapter, we give a concise introduction to LRP with a discussion of (1) how to implement propagation rules easily and efficiently, (2) how the propagation procedure can be theoretically justified as a ‘deep Taylor decomposition', (3) how to choose the propagation rules at each layer to deliver high explanation quality, and (4) how LRP can be extended to handle a variety of machine learning scenarios beyond deep neural networks.},

white spruce chronologies for the Seward Peninsula

dating from 1358 to 2001 AD. A composite chronology
derived from these data correlates positively and
significantly with summer temperatures at Nome from
1910 to 1970, after which there is some loss of
positive temperature response. There is inferred
cooling during periods within the Little Ice Age
(LIA) from the early to middle 1600s and late 1700s
to middle 1800s; and warming from the middle 1600s
to early 1700s. We also present a larger composite
data set covering 978-2001 AD, utilizing the SP
ring-width data in combination with archaeological
wood measurements and other recent collections from
northwestern Alaska. The Regional Curve
Standardization (RCS) method was employed to
maximize potential low-frequency information in this
data set. The RCS chronology shows intervals of
persistent above-average growth around the time of
the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) early in the
millennium, which are comparable to growth levels in
recent centuries. There is a more sustained cold
interval during the LIA inferred from the RCS record
as compared to the SP ring-width series. The
chronologies correlate significantly with Bering and
Chukchi Sea sea surface temperatures and with the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. These
atmosphere-ocean linkages probably account for the
differences between these records and large-scale
reconstructions of Arctic and Northern Hemisphere
temperatures based largely on continental interior
proxy data.},

reconstructed SST data show that the late 20th

temperature shifts are more pronounced for winters,
implying a close effect of the west Pacific warm

former is a primary force controlling the climatic
system of the region. Results of this study and
previously published data indicate a close link of
temperature shifts between the boreal summer and the

In contrast to the satellite data, which exhibit a slight increase in SIE, the mean SIE of the models over 1979–2005 shows a decrease in each month, with the greatest multimodel mean percentage monthly decline of 13.6{\%} decade−1 in February and the greatest absolute loss of ice of −0.40 × 106 km2 decade−1 in September.

abstract = {Reducing loss of life and harm when a hurricane threatens depends on people receiving hurricane risk information that they can interpret and use in protective decisions. To understand and improve hurricane risk communication, this article examines how National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters at the National Hurricane Center and local weather forecast offices, local emergency managers, and local television and radio media create and convey hurricane risk information. Data from in-depth interviews and observational sessions with members of these groups from Greater Miami were analyzed to examine their roles, goals, and interactions, and to identify strengths and challenges in how they communicate with each other and with the public. Together, these groups succeed in partnering with each other to make information about approaching hurricane threats widely available. Yet NWS forecasters sometimes find that the information they provide is not used as they intended; media personnel want streamlined information from NWS and emergency managers that emphasizes the timing of hazards and the recommended response and protective actions; and emergency managers need forecast uncertainty information that can help them plan for different scenarios. Thus, we recommend that warning system partners 1) build understanding of each other's needs and constraints; 2) ensure formalized, yet flexible mechanisms exist for exchanging critical information; 3) improve hurricane risk communication by integrating social science knowledge to design and test messages with intended audiences; and 4) evaluate, test, and improve the NWS hurricane-related product suite in collaboration with social scientists. {\textcopyright}2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Objective measures of climate model performance are proposed and used to assess simulations of the 20th century, which are available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) archive. The primary focus of this analysis is on the climatology of atmospheric fields. For each variable considered, the models are ranked according to a measure of relative error. Based on an average of the relative errors over all fields considered, some models appear to perform substantially better than others. Forming a single index of model performance, however, can be misleading in that it hides a more complex picture of the relative merits of different models. This is demonstrated by examining individual variables and showing that the relative ranking of models varies considerably from one variable to the next. A remarkable exception to this finding is that the so-called "mean model" consistently outperforms all other models in nearly every respect. The usefulness, limitations and robustness of the metrics defined here are evaluated 1) by examining whether the information provided by each metric is correlated in any way with the others, and 2) by determining how sensitive the metrics are to such factors as observational uncertainty, spatial scale, and the domain considered (e.g., tropics versus extra-tropics). An index that gauges the fidelity of model variability on interannual time-scales is found to be only weakly correlated with an index of the mean climate performance. This illustrates the importance of evaluating a broad spectrum of climate processes and phenomena since accurate simulation of one aspect of climate does not guarantee accurate representation of other aspects. Once a broad suite of metrics has been developed to characterize model performance it may become possible to identify optimal subsets for various applications.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} There are heated debates on the existence of the global warming slowdown during the early 21 {\textless}sup{\textgreater}st{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} century. Although efforts have been made to clarify or reconcile the controversy over the issue, it is not explicitly addressed, restricting the understanding of global temperature change particularly under the background of increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations. Here, using extensive temperature datasets, we comprehensively reexamine the existence of the slowdown under all existing definitions during all decadal-scale periods spanning 1990-2017. Results show that the short-term linear-trend dependent definitions of slowdown make its identification severely suffer from the period selection bias, which largely explains the controversy over its existence. Also, the controversy is further aggravated by the significant impacts of the differences between various datasets on the recent temperature trend and the different baselines for measuring slowdown prescribed by various definitions. However, when the focus is shifted from specific periods to the probability of slowdown events, we find the probability is significantly higher in the 2000s than in the 1990s, regardless of which definition and dataset are adopted. This supports a slowdown during the early 21 {\textless}sup{\textgreater}st{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} century relative to the warming surge in the late 20 {\textless}sup{\textgreater}th{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} century, despite higher greenhouse-gas concentrations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this decadal-scale slowdown is not incompatible with the centennial-scale anthropogenic warming trend, which has been accelerating since 1850 and never pauses or slows. This work partly reconciles the controversy over the existence of the warming slowdown and the discrepancy between the slowdown and anthropogenic warming. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {During late February and early March 2018, an unusual polynya was observed off the north coast of Greenland. This period was also notable for the occurrence of a sudden stratospheric warming. Here we use satellite and in situ data, a reanalysis and an ice-ocean model to document the evolution of the polynya and its synoptic forcing. We show that its magnitude was unprecedented and that it was associated with the transient response to the sudden stratospheric warming leading to anomalous warm southerly flow in north Greenland. Indeed, regional wind speeds and temperatures were the highest during February going back to the 1960s. There is evidence that the thinning sea ice has increased its wind-driven mobility. However, we show that the polynya would have developed under thicker ice conditions representative of the late 1970s and that even with the predicted trend toward thinner sea ice, it will only open during enhanced southerly flow.},

abstract = {It is argued from SST observations for the period
1950-90 that the tropical Indo-Pacific
ocean-atmosphere system may be described as a stable
linear dynamical system driven by spatially coherent
Gaussian white noise. Evidence is presented that the
predictable component of SST anomaly growth is
associated with the constructive interference of
several damped normal modes after an optimal initial
structure is set up by the white noise forcing. In
particular, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
growth is associated with an interplay of at least
three damped normal modes, with periods longer than
two years and decay times of 4 to 8 months, rather
than the manifestation of a single unstable mode
whose growth is arrested by
nonlinearities. Interestingly, the relevant modes
are; not the three least damped modes of the
system. Rather, mode selection, and the
establishment of the optimal initial structure from
which growth occurs, are controlled by the
stochastic forcing. Experiments conducted with an
empirical stochastic-dynamical model show that
stochastic forcing not only adds energy to the
system, but also plays a role in setting up the
optimal structure. It is shown that growth from
modal interference can occur for as long as 18
months, which within the confines of this model
defines a predictability limit for growth
events. Growth associated with the stochastic
forcing is also possible, but is unpredictable. The
timescale on which the predictable and unpredictable
components of SST growth become comparable to each
other gives a more conservative predictability limit
of 15 months. The above scenario is based on
empirical evidence obtained from SST anomalies
alone. From the results of several tests based on
statistical properties of linear and nonlinear
dynamical systems, one may conclude that much of the
ENSO cycle in nature is dominated by stable, forced
dynamics.},

The dipole anomaly corresponds to the second-leading mode of EOF of monthly mean sea level pressure (SLP) north of 70°N during the winter season (October–March) and accounts for 13{\%} of the variance. One of its two anomalous centers is stably occupied between the Kara Sea and Laptev Sea; the other is situated from the Canadian Archipelago through Greenland extending southeastward to the Nordic seas.

abstract = {Many problems in climate science require the identification of signals obscured by both the “noise” of internal climate variability and differences across models. Following previous work, we train an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the year of a given map of annual-mean temperature (or precipitation) from forced climate model simulations. This prediction task requires the ANN to learn forced patterns of change amidst a background of climate noise and model differences. We then apply a neural network visualization technique (layerwise relevance propagation) to visualize the spatial patterns that lead the ANN to successfully predict the year. These spatial patterns thus serve as “reliable indicators” of the forced change. The architecture of the ANN is chosen such that these indicators vary in time, thus capturing the evolving nature of regional signals of change. Results are compared to those of more standard approaches like signal-to-noise ratios and multilinear regression in order to gain intuition about the reliable indicators identified by the ANN. We then apply an additional visualization tool (backward optimization) to highlight where disagreements in simulated and observed patterns of change are most important for the prediction of the year. This work demonstrates that ANNs and their visualization tools make a powerful pair for extracting climate patterns of forced change.},

The $\delta$18O of speleothem calcite at this Puerto Rican location varies primarily in response to changes in the amount of summer-time precipitation. The speleothem documents multi-decadal to centennial length oscillations in $\delta$18O that point to large variations in rainfall that have not been manifest in the short instrumental period. Since AD 1850, variations in $\delta$18O have tracked shifts in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).

We test for 'pauses', both in the normally understood meaning of the term to mean no warming trend, as well as for a 'pause' defined as a substantially slower trend in GMST. The tests are carried out with the historical versions of GMST that existed for each pause-interval tested, and with current versions of each of the GMST datasets. The tests are conducted following the common (but questionable) practice of breaking the linear fit at the start of the trend interval ('broken' trends), and also with trends that are continuous with the data bordering the trend interval. We also compare results when appropriate allowance is made for the selection bias problem. The results show that there is little or no statistical evidence for a lack of trend or slower trend in GMST using either the historical data or the current data. The perception that there was a 'pause' in GMST was bolstered by earlier biases in the data in combination with incomplete statistical testing.},

well as their partitioning into the within-month
transient and quasi-stationary components. The
latter includes the long-term mean and interannual

corresponds to the large-scale overturning global

quasi-stationary planetary waves, which are
primarily a factor in the Northern Hemisphere
winter. In addition to the mean annual cycle,
results are presented for the interannual
variability. In the extratropics, poleward
transports of both latent and dry static energy
reinforce one another. However, the results
highlight strong cancellations between the
transports of latent and dry static energy in the
Tropics as moisture is converted into latent heat,
and also between quasi-stationary and transient
components in the extratropics. Hence the total
energy transports and divergences are fairly
seamless with latitude and the total interannual
variability is substantially less than that of the
components. The strong interplay between the
transient and quasi-stationary waves in the
atmosphere highlights the symbiotic relationship
between them, as the stationary waves determine the
location and intensity of the storm tracks while the
transient disturbances help maintain the stationary
waves. These results highlight that observationally
there is a very strong constraint that the global

Current estimates suggest that, for the Arctic as a whole, nearly one-half of the observed loss of summer sea ice cover is not due to anthropogenic forcing but rather is due to internal variability. Using the 40 members of the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), our analysis provides the first regional assessment of the role of internal variability on the observed sea ice loss. The CESM-LE is one of the best available models for such an analysis, because it performs better than other CMIP5 models for many metrics of importance. Our study reveals that the local contribution of internal variability has a large range and strongly depends on the month and region in question. We find that the pattern of internal variability is highly nonuniform over the Arctic, with internal variability accounting for less than 10{\%} of late summer (August–September) East Siberian Sea sea ice loss but more than 60{\%} of the Kara Sea sea ice loss. In contrast, spring (April–May) sea ice loss, notably in the Barents Sea, has so far been dominated by internal variability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As in previous research, risk perception and the perceived vulnerability of one's home were motivating factors for hurricane evacuation. Local television news was the most important source for hurricane information. Trust in local news and viewing a weathercast in the last twenty-four hours were related to risk perception. This study was the first to examine the one-sided parasocial relationship (PSR) that develops between a viewer and a local television news or weathercaster and the viewer's response to a hurricane. Although PSR was not related to hurricane risk perception or protective actions as anticipated, this article explores reasons that may have led to this surprising result including changes in the media landscape, or the potential for the weathercaster to play different roles in different extreme weather events. The findings contribute to our understanding of information use during a hurricane. It also raises questions about the future of media influence on decision-making.},

abstract = {A database of monthly climate observations from
meteorological stations is constructed. The database
includes six climate elements and extends over the
global land surface. The database is checked for
inhomogeneities in the station records using an
automated method that refines previous methods by
using incomplete and partially overlapping records
and by detecting inhomogeneities with opposite signs
in different seasons. The method includes the
development of reference series using neighbouring
stations. Information from different sources about a
single station may be combined, even without an
overlapping period, using a reference series. Thus,
a longer station record may be obtained and
fragmentation of records reduced. The reference
series also enables 1961-90 normals to be calculated
for a larger proportion of stations. The station
anomalies are interpolated onto a 0.5 degrees grid
covering the global land surface (excluding
Antarctica) and combined with a published normal
from 1961-90. Thus, climate grids are constructed
for nine climate variables (temperature, diurnal
temperature range, daily minimum and maximum
temperatures, precipitation, wet-day frequency,
frost-day frequency, vapour pressure, and cloud
cover) for the period 1901-2002. This dataset is
known as CRU TS 2.1 and is publicly available

@article{Crameri2018b,
abstract = {Abstract. Today's geodynamic models can, often do and sometimes have to become very complex. Their underlying, increasingly elaborate numerical codes produce a growing amount of raw data. Post-processing such data is therefore becoming more and more important, but also more challenging and time-consuming. In addition, visualising processed data and results has, in times of coloured figures and a wealth of half-scientific software, become one of the weakest pillars of science, widely mistreated and ignored. Efficient and automated geodynamic diagnostics and sensible scientific visualisation preventing common pitfalls is thus more important than ever. Here, a collection of numerous diagnostics for plate tectonics and mantle dynamics is provided and a case for truly scientific visualisation is made. Amongst other diagnostics are a most accurate and robust plate-boundary identification, slab-polarity recognition, plate-bending derivation, surface-topography component splitting and mantle-plume detection. Thanks to powerful image processing tools and other elaborate algorithms, these and many other insightful diagnostics are conveniently derived from only a subset of the most basic parameter fields. A brand new set of scientific quality, perceptually uniform colour maps including devon, davos, oslo and broc is introduced and made freely available (http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps, last access: 25 June 2018). These novel colour maps bring a significant advantage over misleading, non-scientific colour maps like rainbow, which is shown to introduce a visual error to the underlying data of up to 7.5 {\%}. Finally, StagLab (http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/StagLab, last access: 25 June 2018) is introduced, a software package that incorporates the whole suite of automated geodynamic diagnostics and, on top of that, applies state-of-the-art scientific visualisation to produce publication-ready figures and movies, all in the blink of an eye and all fully reproducible. StagLab, a simple, flexible, efficient and reliable tool made freely available to everyone, is written in MATLAB and adjustable for use with geodynamic mantle convection codes.},

@article{trenberth05_water_vapor,
abstract = {An analysis and evaluation has been performed of
global datasets on column-integrated water vapor
(precipitable water). For years before 1996, the
Ross and Elliott radiosonde dataset is used for
validation of European Centre for Medium-range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalyses ERA-40. Only
the special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) dataset
from remote sensing systems (RSS) has credible
means, variability and trends for the oceans, but it
is available only for the post-1988 period. Major
problems are found in the means, variability and
trends from 1988 to 2001 for both reanalyses from
National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)
and the ERA-40 reanalysis over the oceans, and for
the NASA water vapor project (NVAP) dataset more
generally. NCEP and ERA-40 values are reasonable
over land where constrained by
radiosondes. Accordingly, users of these data should
take great care in accepting results as real. The
problems highlight the need for reprocessing of
data, as has been done by RSS, and reanalyses that
adequately take account of the changing observing
system. Precipitable water variability for 1988-2001
is dominated by the evolution of ENSO and especially
the structures that occurred during and following
the 1997-98 El Nino event. The evidence from SSM/I
for the global ocean suggests that recent trends in
precipitable water are generally positive and, for
1988 through 2003, average 0.40 +/- 0.09 mm per
decade or 1.3 +/- 0.3{\%} per decade for the ocean as
a whole, where the error bars are 95{\%} confidence
intervals. Over the oceans, the precipitable water
variability relates very strongly to changes in
SSTs, both in terms of spatial structure of trends
and temporal variability (with regression
coefficient for 30 degrees N-30 degrees S of 7.8{\%}
K-1) and is consistent with the assumption of fairly
constant relative humidity. In the tropics, the
trends are also influenced by changes in rainfall
which, in turn, are closely associated with the mean
flow and convergence of moisture by the trade
winds. The main region where positive trends are not
very evident is over Europe, in spite of large and
positive trends over the North Atlantic since
1988. A much longer time series is probably required
to obtain stable patterns of trends over the oceans,
although the main variability could probably be
deduced from past SST and associated precipitation
variations.},

abstract = {Artificial neural-networks have the potential to emulate cloud processes with higher accuracy than the semi-empirical emulators currently used in climate models. However, neural-network models do not intrinsically conserve energy and mass, which is an obstacle to using them for long-term climate predictions. Here, we propose two methods to enforce linear conservation laws in neural-network emulators of physical models: Constraining (1) the loss function or (2) the architecture of the network itself. Applied to the emulation of explicitly-resolved cloud processes in a prototype multi-scale climate model, we show that architecture constraints can enforce conservation laws to satisfactory numerical precision, while all constraints help the neural-network better generalize to conditions outside of its training set, such as global warming.},

@article{Zhang2014,
abstract = {In this study, the authors investigate the connection between the South Pacific atmospheric variability and the tropical Pacific climate in models of different degrees of coupling between the atmosphere and ocean. A robust mode of variability, defined as the South Pacific meridional mode (SPMM), is identified in a multimodel ensemble of climate model experiments where the atmosphere is only thermodynamically coupled to a slab ocean mixed layer. The physical interpretation of the SPMM is nearly identical to the North Pacific meridional mode (NPMM) with the off-equatorial southeast trade wind variability altering the latent heat flux and sea surface temperature (SST) and initiating a wind-evaporation-SST feedback that propagates signals into the tropics. The authors also show that a positive cloud feedback plays a role in the development of this mode, but this effect is model dependent. While physically analogous to the NPMM, theSPMMhas a stronger expression in the equatorial Pacific and directly perturbs the zonal gradients of SST and sea level pressure (SLP) on the equator, thus leading to ENSO-like variability despite the lack of ocean-atmosphere dynamical coupling. Further analysis suggests that the SPMM is also active in fully coupled climate models and observations. This study highlights the important role of the Southern Hemisphere in tropical climate variability and suggests that including observations from the data-poor South Pacific could improve the ENSO predictability. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

The phase of the QBO had little effect on the results in the weak wave (100 m) cases, which did not produce warmings, and the strong wave (400 m) cases, which produced major sudden warmings. At intermediate forcing amplitudes (particularly around 250 m), large wave amplitudes and stratospheric warmings occurred in both westerly and easterly QBO simulations. The warmings occurred earlier, however, and wave variability was stronger for the easterly phase, in qualitative agreement with observations.},

Time-series of elevation changes will enable determination of the present-day mass balance of the ice sheets, study of associations between observed ice changes and polar climate, and estimation of the present and future contributions of the ice sheets to global sea level rise. Other scientific objectives of ICESat include: global measurements of cloud heights and the vertical structure of clouds and aerosols; precise measurements of land topography and vegetation canopy heights; and measurements of sea ice roughness, sea ice thickness, ocean surface elevations, and surface reflectivity. The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on ICESat has a 1064 nm laser channel for surface altimetry and dense cloud heights and a 532 nm lidar channel for the vertical distribution of clouds and aerosols. The predicted accuracy for the surface-elevation measurements is 15 cm, averaged over 60 m diameter laser footprints spaced at 172 m along-track. The orbital altitude will be around 600 km at an inclination of 94° with a 183-day repeat pattern. The on-board GPS receiver will enable radial orbit determinations to better than 5 cm, and star-trackers will enable footprints to be located to 6 m horizontally. The spacecraft attitude will be controlled to point the laser beam to within±35 m of reference surface tracks at high latitudes. ICESat is designed to operate for 3–5 years and should be followed by successive missions to measure ice changes for at least 15 years.},

It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850-near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: How does the Earth system respond to forcing What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

abstract = {Large initial condition ensembles of a climate model simulation provide many different realizations of internal variability noise superimposed on an externally forced signal. They have been used to estimate signal emergence time at individual grid points, but are rarely employed to identify global fingerprints of human influence. Here we analyze 50- and 40-member ensembles performed with 2 climate models; each was run with combined human and natural forcings. We apply a pattern-based method to determine signal detection time td in individual ensemble members. Distributions of td are characterized by the median td{\{}m{\}} and range td{\{}r{\}}, computed for tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures over 1979 to 2018. Lower stratospheric cooling—primarily caused by ozone depletion—yields td{\{}m{\}} values between 1994 and 1996, depending on model ensemble, domain (global or hemispheric), and type of noise data. For greenhouse-gas–driven tropospheric warming, larger noise and slower recovery from the 1991 Pinatubo eruption lead to later signal detection (between 1997 and 2003). The stochastic uncertainty td{\{}r{\}} is greater for tropospheric warming (8 to 15 y) than for stratospheric cooling (1 to 3 y). In the ensemble generated by a high climate sensitivity model with low anthropogenic aerosol forcing, simulated tropospheric warming is larger than observed; detection times for tropospheric warming signals in satellite data are within td{\{}r{\}} ranges in 60{\%} of all cases. The corresponding number is 88{\%} for the second ensemble, which was produced by a model with even higher climate sensitivity but with large aerosol-induced cooling. Whether the latter result is physically plausible will require concerted efforts to reduce significant uncertainties in aerosol forcing.},

Here, we show a first analysis indicating that the models in the new ensemble agree better with observations than those in older ones and that the poorest models have been eliminated. Most models are strongly tied to their predecessors, and some also exchange ideas and code with other models, thus supporting an earlier hypothesis that the models in the new ensemble are neither independent of each other nor independent of the earlier generation. On the basis of one atmosphere model, we show how statistical methods can identify similarities between model versions and complement process understanding in characterizing how and why a model has changed.

It is shown that changes in August/September sea ice concentration impact on tropospheric and stratospheric geopotential heights in the following winter. During low ice phases a negative tropospheric Arctic Oscillation pattern is found, which is connected to a weakened stratospheric polar vortex and warmer stratospheric temperatures. Furthermore, the analysis reveals enhanced upward EP fluxes due to planetary waves for low ice conditions. Strong stratospheric anomalies in the Atlantic/European region are associated with a weaker polar vortex. Low ice periods are connected with additional tropospheric wave energy excitation in the Pacific/North America region and influence the stratosphere through three-dimensional planetary wave propagation.

On all timescales examined (2-50+ years), the most extreme negative observed late 20th century trends cannot be explained by modeled natural variability alone. Modeled late 20th century ice extent loss also cannot be explained by natural causes alone, but the six available CCSM4 ensemble members exhibit a large spread in their late 20th century ice extent loss. Comparing trends from the CCSM4 ensemble to observed trends suggests that internal variability explains approximately half of the observed 1979-2005 September Arctic sea ice extent loss. In a warming world, CCSM4 shows that multi-decadal negative trends increase in frequency and magnitude, and that trend variability on 2-10 year timescales increases. Furthermore, when internal variability counteracts anthropogenic forcing, positive trends on 2-20 year timescales occur until the middle of the 21st century.

abstract = {This article applies formal detection and
attribution techniques to investigate the nature of
observed shifts in the timing of streamflow in the
western United States. Previous studies have shown
that the snow hydrology of the western United States
has changed in the second half of the twentieth
century. Such changes manifest themselves in the
form of more rain and less snow, in reductions in
the snow water contents, and in earlier snowmelt and
associated advances in streamflow ``center'' timing
(the day in the ``water-year'' on average when half
the water-year flow at a point has passed). However,
with one exception over a more limited domain, no
other study has attempted to formally attribute
these changes to anthropogenic increases of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using the
observations together with a set of global climate
model simulations and a hydrologic model (applied to
three major hydrological regions of the western
United States-the California region, the upper
Colorado River basin, and the Columbia River basin),
it is found that the observed trends toward earlier
``center'' timing of snowmelt-driven streamflows in
the western United States since 1950 are detectably
different from natural variability (significant at
the p {\textless} 0.05 level). Furthermore, the nonnatural
parts of these changes can be attributed confidently
to climate changes induced by anthropogenic
greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, and land use. The
signal from the Columbia dominates the analysis, and
it is the only basin that showed a detectable signal
when the analysis was performed on individual
basins. It should be noted that although climate
change is an important signal, other climatic
processes have also contributed to the hydrologic
variability of large basins in the western United
States.},

abstract = {Despite the pervasive impact of drought on human and natural systems, the large-scale mechanisms conducive to regional drying remain poorly understood. Here we use a multivariate approach1,2 to identify two distinct externally forced fingerprints from multiple ensembles of Earth system model simulations. The leading fingerprint, FM1(x), is characterized by global warming, intensified wet–dry patterns3 and progressive large-scale continental aridification, largely driven by multidecadal increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The second fingerprint, FM2(x), captures a pronounced interhemispheric temperature contrast4,5, associated meridional shifts in the intertropical convergence zone6–9 and correlated anomalies in precipitation and aridity over California10, the Sahel11,12 and India. FM2(x) exhibits nonlinear temporal behaviour: the intertropical convergence zone moves southwards before 1975 in response to increases in hemispherically asymmetric sulfate aerosol emissions, and it shifts northwards after 1975 due to reduced sulfur dioxide emissions and the GHG-induced warming of Northern Hemisphere landmasses. Both fingerprints are statistically identifiable in observations of joint changes in temperature, rainfall and aridity during 1950–2014. We show that the reliable simulation of these changes requires combined forcing by GHGs, direct and indirect effects of aerosols, and large volcanic eruptions. Our results suggest that GHG-induced aridification may be modulated regionally by future reductions in sulfate aerosol emissions.},

Details on the coding implementa- tion, along with in-depth information on running the CAM 3.0 code, are given in a separate technical report entitled "User's Guide to NCAR CAM 3.0" [Kluzek et al., 2002]. As before, it is our objective that this model provide NCAR and the university research community with a reliable, well documented atmospheric general circulation model. This version of the CAM 3.0 incorporates significant improvements to the physics package (e.g. generalized cloud overlap for radiation calculations), new capabilities such as the incorporation of thermodynamic sea ice, and a number of enhancements to the implementation (e.g. clean separation between physics and dynamics). We believe that collectively these improvements provide the research community with a significantly improved atmospheric modeling capability.},

@article{mathieu02,
abstract = {[1] Incorporating stable isotope physics in a
general circulation model (GCM) provides a promising
means to study isotopic variability in
precipitation, including the processes that cause
isotopic variability in paleoclimatic archives such
as ice cores. This paper describes the
implementation and validation of stable isotope
tracers in the GENESIS 2.0 GCM. The model reproduces
the main features of present-day isotopic fields and
the characteristic large-scale isotope-climate
relationships. Global delta(18)O-deltaD,
temperature-delta(18)O, and precipitation-delta(18)O
relationships are well simulated, and the modeled
regional patterns associated with continental vapor
recycling over Europe and vertical gradients agree
well with observations. In GENESIS a more
sophisticated parameterization of interactions
between precipitation and atmospheric vapor
contributes to a better simulation of isotopic
variations in dry climates. The standard model
underestimates the global mean deuterium excess
(deltaD-8delta(18)O) in precipitation, although a
heuristic sensitivity test suggests this may be
remedied by accounting for nonneutral stratification
in isotopic evaporative fractionation over
ocean. Errors in simulated isotopic fields are
analyzed to determine whether they are caused by
local climatic biases in the GCM or by inaccurate
parameterizations of isotope physics. Using the
results of sensitivity experiments and comparisons
with other isotopic GCM results, we identify key
isotopic and climatic processes at the origin of the
main errors and suggest additional studies to
improve isotope simulations.},

abstract = {The origins of the delayed increases in global surface temperature accompanying El Ni{\~{n}}o events and the implications for the role of diabatic processes in El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are explored. The evolution of global mean surface temperatures, zonal means and fields of sea surface temperatures, land surface temperatures, precipitation, outgoing longwave radiation, vertically integrated diabatic heating and divergence of atmospheric energy transports, and ocean heat content in the Pacific is documented using correlation and regression analysis. For 1950-1998, ENSO linearly accounts for 0.06°C of global surface temperature increase. Warming events peak 3 months after SSTs in the Ni{\~{n}}o 3.4 region, somewhat less than is found in previous studies. Warming at the surface progressively extends to about ±30° latitude with lags of several months. While the development of ocean heat content anomalies resembles that of the delayed oscillator paradigm, the damping of anomalies through heat fluxes into the atmosphere introduces a substantial diabatic component to the discharge and recharge of the ocean heat content. However, most of the delayed warming outside of the tropical Pacific comes from persistent changes in atmospheric circulation forced from the tropical Pacific. A major part of the ocean heat loss to the atmosphere is through evaporation and thus is realized in the atmosphere as latent heating in precipitation, which drives teleconnections. Reduced precipitation and increased solar radiation in Australia, Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and northern South America contribute to surface warming that peaks several months after the El Ni{\~{n}}o event. Teleconnections contribute to the extensive warming over Alaska and western Canada through a deeper Aleutian low and stronger southerly flow into these regions 0-12 months later. The 1976/1977 climate shift and the effects of two major volcanic eruptions in the past 2 decades are reflected in different evolution of ENSO events. At the surface, for 1979-1998 the warming in the central equatorial Pacific develops from the west and progresses eastward, while for 1950-1978 the anomalous warming begins along the coast of South America and spreads westward. The eastern Pacific south of the equator warms 4-8 months later for 1979-1998 but cools from 1950 to 1978.},

Anomalous Rossby waves forced by the sea ice anomalies penetrate into the stratosphere in February and weaken the stratospheric polar vortex, resulting in negative anomalies of the northern annular mode (NAM) that propagate downward during the following weeks, especially over the North Pacific. The seasonality of the response is attributed to timing of the phasing between the forced and climatological waves.

This long-term regional warming is an order of magnitude smaller than temperature anomalies observed during the event, indicating that most of the extreme warmth must be explained by other factors. Several lines of evidence strongly implicate natural variations as the primary cause for the extreme event. The 2012 temperature anomalies had a close analog in an exceptionally warm U.S. March occurring over 100 years earlier, providing observational evidence that an extreme event similar to March 2012 could be produced through natural variability alone.

The latter coefficient, which is of the order of 70 ly day−1 (°C)−1, varies with latitude by as much as 20{\%}. It is suggested that the use of the above relation as a flux-type thermal boundary condition would allow for large-scale thermal coupling of ocean and atmosphere.

Summary: The popularity of and controversies surrounding this topic have spurred a multitude of approaches and often-conflicting studies that have widened the envelope of our understanding but hindered a scientific consensus.

abstract = {Using experiments with an atmospheric general
circulation model, the climate impacts of a
basin-scale warming or cooling of the North Atlantic
Ocean are investigated. Multidecadal fluctuations
with this pattern were observed during the twentieth
century, and similar variations-but with larger
amplitude-are believed to have occurred in the more
distant past. It is found that in all seasons the
response to warming the North Atlantic is strongest,
in the sense of highest signal-to-noise ratio, in
the Tropics. However there is a large seasonal cycle
in the climate impacts. The strongest response is
found in boreal summer and is associated with
suppressed precipitation and elevated temperatures
over the lower-latitude parts of North and South
America. In August-September-October there is a
significant reduction in the vertical shear in the
main development region for Atlantic hurricanes. In
winter and spring, temperature anomalies over land
in the extratropics are governed by dynamical
changes in circulation rather than simply reflecting
a thermodynamic response to the warming or cooling
of the ocean. The tropical climate response is
primarily forced by the tropical SST anomalies, and
the major features are in line with simple models of
the tropical circulation response to diabatic
heating anomalies. The extratropical climate
response is influenced both by tropical and
higher-latitude SST anomalies and exhibits nonlinear
sensitivity to the sign of the SST
forcing. Comparisons with multidecadal changes in
sea level pressure observed in the twentieth century
support the conclusion that the impact of North
Atlantic SST change is most important in summer, but
also suggest a significant influence in lower
latitudes in autumn and winter. Significant climate
impacts are not restricted to the Atlantic basin,
implying that the Atlantic Ocean could be an
important driver of global decadal variability. The
strongest remote impacts are found to occur in the
tropical Pacific region in June-August and
September-November. Surface anomalies in this region
have the potential to excite coupled
ocean-atmosphere feedbacks, which are likely to play
an important role in shaping the ultimate climate
response.},

abstract = {A suite of divalent metal (Ca, Cd, Ba) carbonates
was synthesized over the temperature range 10-40
degrees C by the classical method of slowly bubbling
N-2 through a bicarbonate solution. It was
discovered that carbonates could be precipitated
reproducibly in or out of isotopic equilibrium with
the environmental solution by varying the
concentrations of bicarbonate and cation,
Precipitation rate had little or no influence on the
isotopic composition of the product. Relatively high
initial concentrations of up to 25 mM in both
bicarbonate and cation were prepared by adding solid
metal chlorides to solutions of NaHCO3. On the basis
of results of equilibrium experiments and a new
determination of the acid fractionation factor, a
new expression is proposed for the oxygen isotope
fractionation between calcite and water at low
temperatures: 10001n alpha(Calcite-H2O) =
18.03(10(3)T(-1))-32.42 where alpha is the
fractionation factor, and T is in kelvins. Combining
new data for low-temperature precipitations and the
high-temperature equilibrium fractionations
published by O'Neil et al. (1969) results in a
revised expression for the oxygen isotope
fractionation between octavite (CdCO3) and water
from 0 degrees to 500 degrees C: 10001n
alpha(CdCO3-H2O) = 2.76(10(6)T(-2))-3.96 The ability
to produce nonequilibrium carbonates allowed
assessment to be made, for the first time, of the
temperature dependence of nonequilibrium stable
isotope fractionations in mineral systems. The
temperature coefficients of cu(carbonate-water) for
nonequilibrium divalent metal carbonates are greater
than those for equilibrium carbonates, a finding
that may bear on the interpretation of analyses of
biogenic carbonates forming out of isotopic
equilibrium in nature. New determinations of acid
fractionation factors (10001n alpha) at 25 degrees C
for calcite (10.44 +/- 0.10), aragonite (11.01 +/-
0.01), and witherite (10.57 +/- 0.16) are mildly to
strongly different from those published by Sharma
and Clayton (1965) and point to a control on this
fractionation by some physical property of the
mineral. Reproducible values for octavite (CdCO3)
varied from 11.18 to 13.60 depending on the
conditions of preparation of the carbonate. These
new values need to be considered in determinations
of absolute O-18/O-16 ratios of international
reference standards and in relating analyses of
carbonates to those of waters, silicates, and
oxides. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

from the western and central US suggest that climate
between approximately 500 and 1350 A.D. was marked
by generally arid conditions with episodes of severe
centennial-scale drought, elevated incidence of wild
fire, cool sea surface temperatures (SSTs) along the
California coast, and dune mobilization in the
western plains. This Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA)
was followed by wetter conditions and warming
coastal SSTs during the transition into the "Little
Ice Age" (LIA). Proxy records from the tropical
Pacific Ocean show contemporaneous changes
indicating cool central and eastern tropical Pacific
SSTs during the MCA, with warmer than modern
temperatures in the western equatorial Pacific. This
pattern of mid-latitude and tropical climate
conditions is consistent with the hypothesis that
the dry MCA in the western US resulted (at least in
part) from tropically forced changes in winter NH
circulation patterns like those associated with
modern La Nina episodes. We examine this hypothesis,
and present other analyses showing that the imprint
of MCA climate change appears in proxy records from
widely distributed regions around the planet, and in
many cases is consistent with a cool medieval
tropical Pacific. One example, explored with
numerical model results, is the suggestion of
increased westerlies and warmer winter temperatures

abstract = {The glaciers of western Canada and the conterminous
United States have dominantly retreated since the
end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the nineteenth
century, although average rates of retreat varied
from strong in the first-half of the twentieth
century, with glaciers stabilizing or even advancing
until 1980, and then resuming consistent
recession. This retreat has been accompanied by
statistically detectable declines in late-summer
streamflow from glacier-fed catchments over much of
the Study area, although there is some geographical
variation: over recent decades, glaciers in
northwest BC and southwest Yukon have lost mass
dominantly by thinning with relatively low rates of
terminal retreat, and glacier-fed streams in that
region have experienced increasing flows. In many
valleys, glacier retreat has produced geomorphic
hazards, including outburst floods from
moraine-dammed lakes, mass failures from
oversteepened valley walls and debris flows
generated on moraines. In addition to these
hydrologic and geomorphic changes, evidence is
presented that glacier retreat will result in higher
stream temperatures, possibly transient increases in
suspended sediment fluxes and concentrations, and
changes in water chemistry. With climate projected
to continue warming over the twenty-first century,
current trends in hydrology, geomorphology and water
quality should continue, with a range of
implications for water resources availability and
management and hydroecology, particularly for cool
and cold-water species such as salmonids. Copyright

abstract = {Future intensification of Amazon drought resulting from climate change may cause increased fire activity, tree mortality, and emissions of carbon to the atmosphere across large areas of Amazonia. To provide a basis for addressing these issues, we examine properties of recent and future meteorological droughts in the Amazon in 35 climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). We find that the CMIP5 climate models, as a group, simulate important properties of historical meteorological droughts in the Amazon. In addition, this group of models reproduces observed relationships between Amazon precipitation and regional sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans. Assuming the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario for future drivers of climate change, the models project increases in the frequency and geographic extent of meteorological drought in the eastern Amazon, and the opposite in the West. For the region as a whole, the CMIP5 models suggest that the area affected by mild and severe meteorological drought will nearly double and triple, respectively, by 2100. Extremes of wetness are also projected to increase after 2040. Specifically, the frequency of periods of unusual wetness and the area affected by unusual wetness are projected to increase after 2040 in the Amazon as a whole, including in locations where annual mean precipitation is projected to decrease. Our analyses suggest that continued emissions of greenhouse gases will increase the likelihood of extreme events that have been shown to alter and degrade Amazonian forests.},

abstract = {T he Arctic is currently warming on average more than twice the global mean, with some regions experiencing even higher rates. Additionally, sea-ice extent is decreasing in all months, which is accompanied by significant sea-ice thinning 1-4. This ongoing change has both local and remote impacts on the climate system, influencing the local surface energy budget as well as large-scale ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns 5-14 and ecosystems 15,16. Is the speed of recent observed Arctic change unprecedented? How do these trends compare with the most pronounced abrupt changes recorded in the palaeoclimate record? Are there similarities between current and past changes in terms of triggering mechanisms? We present answers to these questions by comparing ongoing and projected change with examples of abrupt changes recorded in Greenland ice cores. Estimated current rates of change and the spatial patterns of trends in ongoing Arctic warming can be obtained by analysing ERA-Interim reanalysis data 17. Annual mean temperature trends over the Arctic during the past 40 years show that over this period, where satellite data are available, major portions have warmed by more than 1 °C per decade (Fig. 1a, red colours and outlined portion ; a warming of 4 °C within 40 years is hereafter referred to as 1 °C per decade). The most pronounced warming is seen over the Eurasian sector of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent land areas, with the highest rates of change in the Barents Sea and over Svalbard, where rates of change are twice the mean of the Eurasian Arctic. The spatial pattern of the warming can be compared with the trend in Arctic sea-ice cover over the same period (Fig. 1b). Areas with high rates of temperature change closely match the regions with high rates of sea-ice loss, emphasizing the expected link between high-amplitude warming, high rates of temperature change and concurrent sea-ice retreat. A natural question that follows from this observation is are these rates of change comparable to the abrupt changes identified in the palaeoclimate record? Abrupt climate changes, as seen in Greenland We next turn to the records of abrupt change in the Greenland ice-core record and compare these with modern Arctic changes. Last glacial DO events. During the last glacial period (120,000-11,000 years ago), more than 20 abrupt periods of warming, known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, took place 18,19. Their impacts can be detected globally in palaeo-archives 20 , but their most marked expression is seen in the deep Greenland ice-core records 21-23. These are the classic and most discussed examples of abrupt climate change, characterized by a series of rapid and high-amplitude warming events over Greenland followed by a more gradual return to cold conditions 18,19. They show that key elements of the climate system are capable of changing abruptly-in particular, in the Arctic region-but with major repercussions throughout the climate system 24-26. Here, we compare present rates of change with those of the past, acknowledging the differences in background climate state (last glacial versus modern era of global warming), differences between their forcing mechanisms (greenhouse gas-driven change in the contemporary Arctic versus unforced change in the past) and differences in the geographical positioning of the changes. In addition, we note that many of the proposed mechanisms driving DO events involve sudden changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and associated ocean-atmosphere heat flux 27,28 , with sea-ice retreat a critical aspect driving the event rapidity and amplitude 29-33. Here, however, we focus primarily on the rates of change rather than the physical mechanisms of the processes involved. A recent review of the dynamics can be found in ref. 34. Quantifying the amplitude of the abrupt warmings recorded in ice cores is done by calibrating the water isotope palaeothermom-eter with absolute temperature change estimates derived from measurements of gas fractionation 35-37. The most comprehensive Abrupt climate change is a striking feature of many climate records, particularly the warming events in Greenland ice cores. These abrupt and high-amplitude events were tightly coupled to rapid sea-ice retreat in the North Atlantic and Nordic Seas, and observational evidence shows they had global repercussions. In the present-day Arctic, sea-ice loss is also key to ongoing warming. This Perspective uses observations and climate models to place contemporary Arctic change into the context of past abrupt Greenland warmings. We find that warming rates similar to or higher than modern trends have only occurred during past abrupt glacial episodes. We argue that the Arctic is currently experiencing an abrupt climate change event, and that climate models underestimate this ongoing warming.

abstract = {Abstract. Thermodynamic profiles are affected by both the large-scale dynamics and the local processes, such as radiation, cloud formation and turbulence. Based on ERA5 reanalysis, radiosoundings and cloud cover observations from winters 2009–2018, this study demonstrates manifold impacts of large-scale circulation on temperature and specific humidity profiles in the circumpolar Arctic north of 65∘ N. Characteristic wintertime circulation types are allocated using self-organizing maps (SOMs). The study shows that influence of different large-scale flows must be viewed as a progressing set of processes: (1) horizontal advection of heat and moisture, driven by circulation, lead to so-called first-order effects on thermodynamic profiles and turbulent surface fluxes, and (2) the advection is followed by transformation of the air through various physical processes, causing second-order effects. An example of second-order effects is the associated cloud formation, which shifts the strongest radiative cooling from the surface to the cloud top. The temperature and specific humidity profiles are most sensitive to large-scale circulation over the Eurasian land west of 90∘ E and the Arctic Ocean sea ice, whereas impacts over North America and Greenland are more ambiguous. Eurasian land, between 90 and 140∘ E, occasionally receives warm and moist air from the northern North Atlantic, which, with the support of radiative impacts of clouds, weakens the otherwise strong temperature and specific humidity inversions. Altitudes of maximum temperature and specific humidity in a profile and their variability between the circulation types are good indicators of the depth of the layer impacted by surface–atmosphere processes interacting with the large-scale circulation. Different circulation types typically cause variations of a few hundred metres to this altitude, and the layer impacted is deepest over north-eastern Eurasia and North America.},

abstract = {The easterly Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) is a
prominent climate feature over the Intra-America
Seas, and it is associated with much of the water
vapor transport from the tropical Atlantic into the
Caribbean Basin. In this study, the North American
Regional Reanalysis (NARR) is analyzed to improve
the understanding of the dynamics of the CLLJ and
its relationship to regional rainfall
variations. Horizontal momentum balances are
examined to understand how jet variations on both
diurnal and seasonal time scales are controlled. The
jet is geostrophic to the first order. Its
previously documented semidiurnal cycle (with minima
at about 0400 and 1600 LT) is caused by semidiurnal
cycling of the meridional geopotential height
gradient in association with changes in the westward
extension of the North Atlantic subtropical high
(NASH). A diurnal cycle is superimposed, associated
with a meridional land-sea breeze (solenoidal
circulation) onto the north coast of South America,
so that the weakest jet velocities occur at 1600
LT. The CLLJ is present throughout the year, and it
is known to vary in strength semiannually. Peak
magnitudes in July are related to the seasonal cycle
of the NASH, and a second maximum in February is
caused by heating over northern South America. From
May through September, zonal geopotential gradients
associated with summer heating over Central America
and Mexico induce meridional flow. The CLLJ splits
into two branches, including a southerly branch that
connects with the Great Plains low-level jet (GPLLJ)
bringing moisture into the central United
States. During the rest of the year, the flow
remains essentially zonal across the Caribbean Basin
and into the Pacific. A strong (weak) CLLJ is
associated with reduced (enhanced) rainfall over the
Caribbean Sea throughout the year in the NARR. The
relationship with precipitation over land depends on
the season. Despite the fact that the southerly
branch of the CLLJ feeds into the meridional GPLLJ
in May through September, variations in the CLLJ
strength during these months do not impact
U.S. precipitation, because the CLLJ strength is
varying in response to regional-scale forcing and
not to changes in the large-scale
circulation. During the cool season, there are
statistically significant correlations between the
CLLJ index and rainfall over the United States. When
the CLLJ is strong, there is anomalous northward
moisture transport across the Gulf of Mexico into
the central United States and pronounced rainfall
increases over Louisiana and Texas. A weak jet is
associated with anomalous westerly flow across the
southern Caribbean region and significantly reduced
rainfall over the south-central United States. No
connection between the intensity of the CLLJ and
drought over the central United States is
found. There are only three drought summers in the
NARR period (1980, 1988, and 2006), and the CLLJ was
extremely weak in 1988 but not in 1980 or 2006.},

abstract = {The impacts of a freshening of surface waters in
high latitudes on the deep, slow, thermohaline
circulation have received enormous attention,
especially the possibility of a shutdown in the
meridional overturning that involves sinking of
surface waters in the northern Atlantic Ocean. A
recent study by Fedorov et al. has drawn attention
to the effects of a freshening on the other main
component of the oceanic circulation-the swift,
shallow, wind-driven circulation that varies on
decadal time scales and is closely associated with
the ventilated thermocline. That circulation too
involves meridional overturning, but its variations
and critical transitions affect mainly the
Tropics. A surface freshening in mid- to high
latitudes can deepen the equatorial thermocline to
such a degree that temperatures along the equator
become as warm in the eastern part of the basin as
they are in the west, the tropical zonal sea surface
temperature gradient virtually disappears, and
permanently warm conditions prevail in the
Tropics. In a model that has both the wind-driven
and thermohaline components of the circulation,

abstract = {A large retreat of sea-ice in the ‘stormy' Atlantic Sector of the Arctic Ocean has become evident through a series of record minima for the winter maximum sea-ice extent since 2015. Results from the Norwegian young sea ICE (N-ICE2015) expedition, a five-month-long (Jan-Jun) drifting ice station in first and second year pack-ice north of Svalbard, showcase how sea-ice in this region is frequently affected by passing winter storms. Here we synthesise the interdisciplinary N-ICE2015 dataset, including independent observations of the atmosphere, snow, sea-ice, ocean, and ecosystem. We build upon recent results and illustrate the different mechanisms through which winter storms impact the coupled Arctic sea-ice system. These short-lived and episodic synoptic-scale events transport pulses of heat and moisture into the Arctic, which temporarily reduce radiative cooling and henceforth ice growth. Cumulative snowfall from each sequential storm deepens the snow pack and insulates the sea-ice, further inhibiting ice growth throughout the remaining winter season. Strong winds fracture the ice cover, enhance ocean-ice-atmosphere heat fluxes, and make the ice more susceptible to lateral melt. In conclusion, the legacy of Arctic winter storms for sea-ice and the ice-associated ecosystem in the Atlantic Sector lasts far beyond their short lifespan.},

@article{Pithan2014,
abstract = {Climate change is amplified in the Arctic region. Arctic amplification has been found in past warm 1 and glacial 2 periods, as well as in historical observations 3,4 and climate model experiments 5,6 . Feedback eeects associated with tem-perature, water vapour and clouds have been suggested to contribute to amplified warming in the Arctic, but the surface albedo feedback—the increase in surface absorption of solar radiation when snow and ice retreat—is often cited as the main contributor 7–10 . However, Arctic amplification is also found in models without changes in snow and ice cover 11,12 . Here we analyse climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archive to quantify the contributions of the various feedbacks. We find that in the simulations, the largest contribution to Arctic amplification comes from a temperature feedbacks: as the surface warms, more energy is radiated back to space in low latitudes, compared with the Arctic. This eeect can be attributed to both the diierent vertical structure of the warming in high and low latitudes, and a smaller increase in emitted blackbody radiation per unit warming at colder temperatures. We find that the surface albedo feedback is the second main contributor to Arctic amplification and that other contributions are substantially smaller or even oppose Arctic amplification. A quantitative understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying Arctic amplification is key to developing confidence in and constraining model projections of Arctic climate change, and to focusing research efforts and model–data comparisons on the most important processes. It is well established that Arctic amplification is in part caused by the surface albedo feedback 5,11,13 . Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fourth assessment report stated that it was not clear whether the surface albedo feedback was the main cause of Arctic amplification 14 , many recent studies indicate or assume that surface albedo feedback is the main cause 7–10 . However, Arctic amplification does occur in models without surface albedo feedback 11,12 and Arctic amplification in coupled climate models (Fig. 1) has been shown to be primarily caused by feedbacks acting on terrestrial longwave radiation 15 . The latter implies that the surface albedo feedback, which changes the absorption of solar shortwave radiation, can play only a secondary role in causing Arctic amplification. Important contributions to Arctic amplification have been suggested to result from the water vapour feedback caused by the greenhouse effect of additional water vapour 12 , the cloud feedback due to changes in the effect of clouds on the Earth's radiative balance 16 and the lapse-rate feedback associated with the vertical structure of warming 5,17 . Changes in atmospheric 18 and oceanic heat transport 6,19,20 are also thought to contribute to Arctic amplification. The direct impact of rising temperatures on outgoing longwave radiation at the top of atmosphere (TOA; temperature feedback) can be decomposed into a contribution from vertically uniform warming of the surface and troposphere (Planck feedback) and a contribution from tropospheric warming that deviates from the vertically uniform profile (lapse-rate feedback). The lapse-rate feedback connected to the vertical structure of atmospheric warming is known to contribute to stronger Arctic than tropical warming 5,17 . In the tropics, air parcels rising in deep convective clouds create a tight coupling between surface and upper-tropospheric temperatures. In a warming climate, these air parcels release more latent heat, steepening the moist adiabatic lapse rate and thus causing greater warming in the upper troposphere than at the surface. Under this top-heavy warming profile, a smaller increase in surface temperatures is required to offset a given TOA imbalance. In the Arctic, cold dense air close to the surface is hardly mixed with the lighter air aloft, leaving radiation as the primary coupling mechanism. Radiative coupling does not impose a certain lapse rate and surface-based warming remains confined to the lowermost parts of the atmosphere. Under this bottom-heavy warming profile, a larger increase in surface temperatures is required to offset a given TOA imbalance. The lapse-rate feedback is therefore negative in the tropics and positive in the Arctic. The Planck feedback is generally overlooked as a contributor to Arctic amplification, even though the underlying physics is well established 21 . The longwave radiation (R) emitted by the Earth's surface rises with temperature (T) following R = $\sigma$ T 4 , where is the surface emissivity close to unity and $\sigma$ the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. Thus, a given increase in emitted radiation requires a larger temperature increase at colder background temperatures. For example, at 30 • C, an external forcing of 1 W m −2 can be balanced by a 0.16 • C warming, whereas at −30 • C a 0.31 • C warming is required to balance the same forcing. As the Arctic is colder than the tropics, the Planck feedback in itself causes Arctic amplification. The local temperature change required to offset the radiative imbalance caused by a given forcing or feedback corresponds to that mechanism's warming contribution. We assess indi-vidual contributions to Arctic amplification as the difference between contributions to Arctic and tropical warming (Fig. 2). Beyond the simple example quoted above, and accounting for the effects of atmosphere and clouds, the radiative flux change at the surface and TOA associated to a known surface temperature change can be computed from radiative kernels 22 . We here invert the kernel method to compute the local warming contributions of the feedbacks. The contribution of the Planck feedback's spatial structure to the spatial structure of warming is estimated as the difference between the warm-ing response for a globally averaged and for the local Planck feedback (Methods).},

abstract = {An evaluation is carried out of the moisture fields,
the precipitation P and evaporation E, and the
moisture transport and divergence in the atmosphere
from the global atmospheric National Centers for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-NCAR reanalyses
produced with four-dimensional-data
assimilation. The moisture fields are summarized by
the precipitable water which is compared with
analyzed fields from NVAP based primarily on Special
Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) over the oceans and
rawinsonde measurements over land, plus TIROS
Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). The moisture
budgets are evaluated through computation of the
freshwater flux at the surface E - P from the
divergence of the total moisture transport, and this
is compared with the reanalysis E - P that is based
upon a 6-hour integration of the assimilating model
and thus depends on the model parametrizations. The
P field is evaluated using Xie-Arkin global
precipitation estimates which, although containing
considerable uncertainties, are believed to be
reliable and good enough to show that there are
substantial biases in the NCEP P. There are many
fields of interest and which are improved over
previous information available. On an annual mean
basis the largest evaporation of over 6 mm/day is in
the subtropical Indian Ocean. However, the NCEP
moisture fields are shown to contain large and
significant biases in the tropics. The tropical
structures are less well defined and values are
generally smaller where they should be high and
higher where they should be low. In addition, the
NCEP moisture fields contain less variability from
year to year. The NCEP model P generally reveals a
double intertropical convergence zone in the central
Pacific and the location of the South Pacific
Convergence Zone is not well captured. Rainfall
amounts are lower than observed in the oceanic
tropical convergence zones. The variability in the
central tropical Pacific of P associated with El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is underestimated
in the NCEP reanalyses and, moreover, is not very
well correlated with the Xie-Arkin product. A bias
for too much rainfall in the model over the
southeastern USA and southeast Asia is also present
in northern summer. The comparison of E - P from the
moisture budget with the model results reveal some
strong systematic differences. In particular,
remarkably, many island stations show up as
bull's-eyes in the difference held. These are
identified as originating from small but systematic
differences in vertical moisture profiles from those
in the surrounding oceans, raising questions about
the influence radius of rawinsonde moisture
observations. Biases in E are inferred from the E -
P differences in some places implying some spurious
land moisture sources. While usually better, the
residual method E - P estimates are inferior to
those from the model parametrizations in some
places. Both estimates are affected by biases in
moisture, as analyzed, and the moisture divergence
depends critically on the velocity divergence
held. The model estimates also depend upon the
parametrizations of subgrid scale processes, such as
convection, that influence E and P. A discussion is
given of sources of errors contributing to the
moisture budgets.},

The trend was consistent with a simulation of the response to the phase-out schedule of anthropogenic emissions under the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, suggesting that a decrease in CH3Br abundance in the Northern Hemisphere of as much as 40{\%} from the level of the early 1990s would be possible by the completion date of the program.},

abstract = {A wide range of hydrological cycles and general
circulations was simulated with an idealized general
circulation model (GCM) by varying the optical
thickness of the longwave absorber. While the
idealized GCM does not capture the full complexity
of the hydrological cycle, the wide range of
climates simulated allows the systematic development
and testing of theories of how precipitation and
moisture transport change as the climate
changes. The simulations show that the character of
the response of the hydrological cycle to variations
in longwave optical thickness differs in different
climate regimes. The global-mean precipitation
increases linearly with surface temperature for
colder climates, but it asymptotically approaches a
maximum at higher surface temperatures. The basic
features of the precipitation-temperature relation,
including the rate of increase in the linear regime,
are reproduced in radiative-convective equilibrium
simulations. Energy constraints partially account
for the precipitation-temperature relation but are
not quantitatively accurate. Large-scale
condensation is most important in the midlatitude
storm tracks, and its behavior is accounted for
using a stochastic model of moisture advection and
condensation. The precipitation associated with
large-scale condensation does not scale with mean
specific humidity, partly because the condensation
region moves upward and meridionally as the climate
warms, and partly because the mean condensation rate
depends on isentropic specific humidity gradients,
which do not scale with the specific humidity
itself. The local water vapor budget relates local
precipitation to evaporation and meridional moisture
fluxes, whose scaling in the subtropics and
extratropics is examined. A delicate balance between
opposing changes in evaporation and moisture flux
divergence holds in the subtropical dry zones. The
extratropical precipitation maximum follows the
storm track in warm climates but lies equatorward of
the storm track in cold climates.},

of African rainfall trends since 1950 are found to
be deducible from the atmosphere's response to the
known variations of global sea surface temperatures

confirmed through the diagnosis of 80 separate 50-yr
climate simulations across a suite of atmospheric
general circulation models. Drying over the Sahel
during boreal summer is shown to be a response to
warming of the South Atlantic relative to North
Atlantic SST, with the ensuing anomalous
interhemispheric SST contrast favoring a more
southern position of the Atlantic intertropical
convergence zone. Southern African drying during
austral summer is shown to be a response to Indian
Ocean warming, with enhanced atmospheric convection
over those warm waters driving subsidence drying
over Africa. The ensemble of greenhouse-gas-forced
experiments, conducted as part of the Fourth
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, fails to simulate the pattern or
amplitude of the twentieth-century African drying,
indicating that the drought conditions were likely
of natural origin. For the period 2000-49, the
ensemble mean of the forced experiments yields a wet
signal over the Sahel and a dry signal over southern
Africa. These rainfall changes are physically
consistent with a projected warming of the North

The results show that the slow modes of variability with the largest impact on decadal GMST anomalies are focused in high-latitude ocean regions, where they have a minimal impact on global TOA radiation. When these regions warm, positive shortwave cloud and sea ice–albedo feedbacks largely cancel the negative feedback of outgoing longwave radiation, resulting in a weak net radiative feedback. As a consequence of the weak net radiative feedback, less energy is required to sustain these long-lived temperature anomalies. In contrast to these weakly radiating high-latitude modes, El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a large impact on the global energy budget, such that it remains the dominant influence on global TOA radiation out to decadal and longer time scales, despite its primarily interannual time scale. These results show that on decadal and longer time scales, different processes control internal variability in GMST than control internal variability in global TOA radiation. The results are used to quantify the impact of low-frequency internal variability and ENSO on estimates of climate sensitivity from historical GMST and TOA-radiative-imbalance anomalies.},

A way forward is through further investigation of atmospheric dynamic mechanisms. During several exceptionally warm Arctic winters since 2007, sea ice loss in the Barents and Kara Seas initiated eastward-propagating wave trains of high and low pressure. Anomalous high pressure east of the Ural Mountains advected Arctic air over central and eastern Asia, resulting in persistent cold spells. Blocking near Greenland related to low-level temperature anomalies led to northerly flow into eastern North America, inducing persistent cold periods. Potential Arctic connections in Europe are less clear. Variability in the North Pacific can reinforce downstream Arctic changes, and Arctic amplification...},

abstract = {Paleoclimate records from the tropical Pacific
suggest the early to mid-Holocene was a period of
reduced El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
variability, with a transition to modern, increased
ENSO frequency occurring some time in the last few
thousand years. However, the nature and timing of
this shift remains uncertain due to the
discontinuous nature and/or coarse resolution of
many ENSO proxies, as well as a lack of agreement
between previously published records. A new,
continuous, climate record from El Junco Crater Lake
in the Galdpagos Islands reveals several abrupt
changes in lake level and precipitation through the
Holocene. Hydroclimatic model simulations suggest
that El Junco lake level responds sensitively to
increases in precipitation associated with El Nino
events, rising during wet El Nino events and falling
during the intervening dry periods. Grain size data
from El Junco sediment cores indicate past lake
level variability, likely associated with changing
seasonal precipitation and ENSO frequency. The grain
size data suggest increased precipitation intensity
prior to 9000+/-120 cal years BP, and after
4200+/-130 cal years BR as well as a two-step
increase in precipitation at 3200+/-160 and
2000+/-100 cal years BP. Maximum Holocene
precipitation and inferred ENSO variability occurred
between 2000+/-100 and 1500+/-70 cal years BP,
during the same period that six other independent
proxy records suggest higher ENSO frequency and
longer, stronger El Nino events. Decreasing sediment
carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios in El Junco sediments
indicate rising lake levels from the early Holocene
to present, corroborating the grain size data. The
inferred increase in precipitation at 4200+/-130 cal
years BP and at 2000 +/- 100 cal years BP coincides
with decreasing Southwest Asian and East Asian
Monsoon intensity, suggesting tropical Pacific
climate and the Asian monsoon were interconnected
systems at centennial to millennial timescales
during the Holocene. A weakening trend in the Asian
monsoon and the trend toward wetter conditions at El
Junco also coincide with a trend toward cooler and
drier conditions inferred from Cariaco Basin
sediment proxies from the mid-Holocene to present,
suggesting the migration of the Intertropical
Convergence Zone (ITCZ) likely influenced
hydrological changes in both the eastern tropical
Pacific and the Asian Monsoon region during the

abstract = {Using high-resolution ice core and tree ring proxies for sea ice extent (SIE), we reconstructed a robust time series of autumn SIE over the Barents-Kara (B-K) sector of the Arctic from AD1289–1993. After intercomparing the results and statistical parameters using the ordinary least squares regression (OLSR), the principle component regression (PCR) and the partial least squares regression (PLSR) methods, SIE time series were synthesized into a more robust series using the weighted average method, which used the explained variances as weights. The results showed that from the end of the 13th century to the end of 18th century, the autumn B-K SIE was large, with large variations and a slightly expanding trend overall. This reflected significant multidecadal oscillations under the Little Ice Age (LIA) background. The B-K SIE began to decrease at the end of the 18th century, and a shrinking trend became significant during the second half of the 19th century, which lasted into the 1930s–1940s. The 1930s–1940s was a period with a relatively low SIE in the B-K Sea, and the SIE had a short period of expansion from the 1940s–1970s. However, the B-K SIE has continuously and significantly shrank since the 1970s. The reduction in the B-K SIE since the end of the 18th century has been unprecedented in both duration and speed over the last 700 years. The B-K SIE has retreated significantly since the 1970s, with a speed 6.18 times greater than the former mean retreating speed. The industrial revolution may be a dominant factor in this result. The Arctic SIE in recent years may be the lowest it has been over the last millennium.},

An exciting and relatively recent development is the uptake of machine learning in the natural sciences, where the major goal is to obtain novel scientific insights and discoveries from observational or simulated data. A prerequisite for obtaining a scientific outcome is domain knowledge, which is needed to gain explainability, but also to enhance scientific consistency. In this article we review explainable machine learning in view of applications in the natural sciences and discuss three core elements which we identified as relevant in this context: transparency, interpretability, and explainability. With respect to these core elements, we provide a survey of recent scientific works that incorporate machine learning and the way that explainable machine learning is used in combination with domain knowledge from the application areas.},

abstract = {The sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) constitutes the latest update on expected future climate change based on a new generation of climate models. To extract reliable estimates of future warming and related uncertainties from these models, the spread in their projections is often translated into probabilistic estimates such as the mean and likely range. Here, we use a model weighting approach, which accounts for the models' historical performance based on several diagnostics as well as model interdependence within the CMIP6 ensemble, to calculate constrained distributions of global mean temperature change. We investigate the skill of our approach in a perfect model test, where we use previous-generation CMIP5 models as pseudo-observations in the historical period. The performance of the distribution weighted in the abovementioned manner with respect to matching the pseudo-observations in the future is then evaluated, and we find a mean increase in skill of about 17{\%} compared with the unweighted distribution. In addition, we show that our independence metric correctly clusters models known to be similar based on a CMIP6 "family tree", which enables the application of a weighting based on the degree of inter-model dependence. We then apply the weighting approach, based on two observational estimates (the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Retrospective Analysis-ERA5, and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2-MERRA-2), to constrain CMIP6 projections under weak (SSP1-2.6) and strong (SSP5-8.5) climate change scenarios (SSP refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). Our results show a reduction in the projected mean warming for both scenarios because some CMIP6 models with high future warming receive systematically lower performance weights. The mean of end-of-century warming (2081-2100 relative to 1995-2014) for SSP5-8.5 with weighting is 3.7g C, compared with 4.1gC without weighting; the likely (66{\%}) uncertainty range is 3.1 to 4.6gC, which equates to a 13{\%} decrease in spread. For SSP1-2.6, the weighted end-of-century warming is 1gC (0.7 to 1.4gC), which results in a reduction of-0.1 gC in the mean and-24 {\%} in the likely range compared with the unweighted case.},

This work proposes a general solution to the problem of understanding classification decisions by pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers. We introduce a methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks. These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only verify the validity of the classification decision, but also focus further analysis on regions of potential interest.We evaluate our method for classifiers trained on PASCAL VOC 2009 images, synthetic image data containing geometric shapes, the MNIST handwritten digits data set and for the pre-trained ImageNet model available as part of the Caffe open source package.},

abstract = {Nobody anticipated that El Nino would be weak and
prolonged in 1992, but brief and intense in
1997/98. Why are various El Nino episodes so
different, and so difficult to predict? The answer
involves the important role played by random
atmospheric disturbances (such as westerly wind
bursts) in sustaining the weakly damped Southern
Oscillation, whose complementary warm and cold
phases are, respectively, El Nino and La Nina. As in
the case of a damped pendulum sustained by modest
blows at random times, so the predictability of El
Nino is limited, not by the amplification of errors
in initial conditions as in the case of weather, but
mainly by atmospheric disturbances interacting with
the Southern Oscillation. Given the statistics of
the wind fluctuations, the probability distribution
function of future sea surface temperature
fluctuations in the eastern equatorial Pacific can
be determined by means of an ensemble of
calculations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere
model. Each member of the ensemble starts from the
same initial conditions and has, superimposed, a
different realization of the noise. Such a
prediction, made at the end of 1996, would have
assigned a higher likelihood to a moderate event
than to the extremely strong event that actually
occurred in 1997. (The rapid succession of several
westerly wind bursts in early 1997 was a relatively
rare phenomenon.) In late 2001, conditions were
similar to those in 1996, which suggested a
relatively high probability of El Nino appearing in
2002. Whether the event will be weak or intense
depends on the random disturbances that materialize
during the year.},

has recently been developed and released to the
climate community. CCSM3 is a coupled climate model
with components representing the atmosphere, ocean,
sea ice, and land surface connected by a flux
coupler. CCSM3 is designed to produce realistic
simulations over a wide range of spatial
resolutions, enabling inexpensive simulations
lasting several millennia or detailed studies of
continental-scale dynamics, variability, and climate
change. This paper will show results from the
configuration used for climate-change simulations
with a T85 grid for the atmosphere and land and a
grid with approximately 1 degrees resolution for the
ocean and sea ice. The new system incorporates
several significant improvements in the physical
parameterizations. The enhancements in the model
physics are designed to reduce or eliminate several
systematic biases in the mean climate produced by
previous editions of CCSM. These include new
treatments of cloud processes, aerosol radiative
forcing, land-atmosphere fluxes, ocean mixed layer
processes, and sea ice dynamics. There are
significant improvements in the sea ice thickness,
polar radiation budgets, tropical sea surface
temperatures, and cloud radiative effects. CCSM3 can
produce stable climate simulations of millennial
duration without ad hoc adjustments to the fluxes
exchanged among the component models. Nonetheless,
there are still systematic biases in the
ocean-atmosphere fluxes in coastal regions west of
continents, the spectrum of ENSO variability, the
spatial distribution of precipitation in the
tropical oceans, and continental precipitation and
surface air temperatures. Work is under way to
extend CCSM to a more accurate and comprehensive

abstract = {We compare observed decadal trends in global mean surface temperature with those predicted using a modelling system that encompasses observed initial condition information, externally forced response (due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosol precursors), and internally generated variability. We consider retrospective decadal forecasts for nine cases, initiated at five year intervals, with the first beginning in 1961 and the last in 2001. Forecast ensembles of size thirty are generated from differing but similar initial conditions. We concentrate on the trends that remain after removing the following natural signals in observations and hindcasts: dynamically induced atmospheric variability, El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the effects of explosive volcanic eruptions. We show that ensemble mean errors in the decadal trend hindcasts are smaller than in a parallel set of uninitialized free running climate simulations. The ENSO signal, which is skillfully predicted out to a year or so, has little impact on our decadal trend predictions, and our modelling system possesses skill, independent of ENSO, in predicting decadal trends in global mean surface temperature.

abstract = {Increasingly, the risk assessment community has recognized the social and cultural aspects of vulnerability to hurricanes and other hazards that impact planning and public communication. How individuals and communities understand and react to natural hazard risk communications can be driven by a number of different cognitive, cultural, economic, and political factors. The social sciences have seen an increased focus over the last decade on studying hurricane understanding and responses from a social, cognitive, or decision science perspective, which, broadly defined, includes a number of disparate fields. This paper is a cross-disciplinary and critical review of those efforts as they are relevant to hurricane risk communication devel-opment. We focus on two areas that, on the basis of a comprehensive literature review and discussions with experts in the field, have received comparatively little attention from the hazards community: 1) research concerning visual communications and the way in which individuals process, understand, and make decisions regarding them and 2) the way in which vulnerable communities understand and interact with hurricane warning communications. We go on to suggest areas that merit increased research and draw lessons or guidance from the broader hazards/social science research realm that has implications for hurricane planning and risk communication, particularly the development and dissemination of hurricane forecast products.},

abstract = {Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) require sea ice for capturing seals and are expected to decline range-wide as global warming and sea-ice loss continue 1,2. Estimating when different subpopulations will likely begin to decline has not been possible to date because data linking ice availability to demographic performance are unavailable for most sub-populations 2 and unobtainable a priori for the projected but yet-to-be-observed low ice extremes 3. Here, we establish the likely nature, timing and order of future demographic impacts by estimating the threshold numbers of days that polar bears can fast before cub recruitment and/or adult survival are impacted and decline rapidly. Intersecting these fasting impact thresholds with projected numbers of ice-free days, estimated from a large ensemble of an Earth system model 4 , reveals when demographic impacts will likely occur in different subpopulations across the Arctic. Our model captures demographic trends observed during 1979-2016, showing that recruitment and survival impact thresholds may already have been exceeded in some subpopulations. It also suggests that, with high greenhouse gas emissions, steeply declining reproduction and survival will jeopardize the persistence of all but a few high-Arctic subpopulations by 2100. Moderate emissions mitigation prolongs persistence but is unlikely to prevent some subpopulation extirpations within this century. Polar bears occur in 19 subpopulations across four arctic ecore-gions 1,2 (Fig. 1). In the southernmost ecoregion (that is, the Seasonal Ice Ecoregion (SIE)), complete sea-ice melt forces bears ashore each summer 1,2 , where they rely on body energy reserves for survival and lactation due to the absence of energetically adequate food 5. Prolonged ice absence from productive continental shelf waters now also forces increasingly long fasts in parts of the other ecore-gions (that is, the Divergent Ice Ecoregion (DIE), Convergent Ice Ecoregion (CIE) and Archipelago Ecoregion (AE)) 6-areas where bears historically continued foraging on perennial ice through summer 1. Although polar bears can fast for months, limits are imposed by the amount of energy bears can store in body reserves before periods of food deprivation 3,5,7. Lengthening fasts have already lowered body condition, reproduction, survival and abundance in some SIE and DIE subpopulations 8-13 , and similar trends are expected throughout the Arctic as ice loss continues 1,2. However, it remains unclear how long bears can fast before substantial declines in lacta-tion (and therefore cub recruitment) and/or adult survival occur. Information on when such fasting thresholds might be exceeded in different subpopulations, or how rapidly demographic rates would decline following threshold exceedance, is also lacking. Estimating timelines for the anticipated declines is challenging because data quantifying sea ice-demography relationships are lacking in most subpopulations 2. Indeed, even in the best-studied subpopulations, abundance projections currently rely on extremely limited data (for example, in the Southern Beaufort Sea, where projections used a threshold of 127 ice-free days to distinguish between good and bad years, based on only 5 years of demographic data 14). Moreover, today's sea-ice conditions differ substantially from anticipated low ice extremes, thus precluding empirical measurements of how reproduction and survival will change before these changes occur 3. Previous projections for the future range and abundance of polar bears attempted to overcome such data gaps with expert judgement 1 and/or extrapolations from a few well-studied subpopu-lations 2 , and consequently could only offer limited spatial and temporal forecast resolution with large uncertainties. Timelines for declining survival and recruitment can be projected , however, even in subpopulations where demographic information is absent, by calculating the energetic needs of fasting polar bears and estimating when longer fasts will preclude meeting those needs 3,15. Moln{\'{a}}r et al. used such energy budget calculations to estimate the likely magnitude of future litter size 15 and adult male survival declines 3 in the Western Hudson Bay subpopulation, but other projections 16,17 incorrectly applied the estimates of Moln{\'{a}}r et al., assuming, for example, a universal 180-d persistence threshold , without performing the necessary energy budget calculations, model tests or uncertainty analyses, to justify this choice and/or extrapolations beyond the Western Hudson Bay subpopulation. Here, we describe dynamic energy budget (DEB) estimates of fasting thresholds that limit offspring recruitment and adult survival. We test whether our estimated thresholds capture reported demographic changes in subpopulations where observations are available , project likely timelines for recruitment and survival declines in all SIE, DIE and CIE subpopulations ({\~{}}80{\%} of Earth's polar bears; Fig. 1) and evaluate the uncertainty surrounding these timelines. The impacts of fasting on recruitment and survival depend on: the energy reserves of bears at fast initiation; their energy expenditures while fasting; and fast duration. We established base-lines for each of these with measurements from bears that were already forced to fast annually for extended periods in the Western Hudson Bay subpopulation (SIE; Fig. 1), and applied sensitivity analyses to these baselines to assess associated uncertainties and},

This difference in approach makes the text ideal as a tutorial guide for senior undergraduates and research students, in science and engineering. After explaining the basic principles of Bayesian probability theory, their use is illustrated with a variety of examples ranging from elementary parameter estimation to image processing. With its central emphasis on a few fundamental rules, this book takes the mystery out of statistics by providing a clear rationale for some of the most widely-used procedures.},

abstract = {Robust projections and predictions of climate variability and change, particularly at regional scales, rely on the driving processes being represented with fidelity in model simulations. The role of enhanced horizontal resolution in improved process representation in all components of the climate system is of growing interest, particularly as some recent simulations suggest both the possibility of significant changes in large-scale aspects of circulation as well as improvements in small-scale processes and extremes. However, such high-resolution global simulations at climate timescales, with resolutions of at least 50 km in the atmosphere and 0.25° in the ocean, have been performed at relatively few research centres and generally without overall coordination, primarily due to their computational cost. Assessing the robustness of the response of simulated climate to model resolution requires a large multi-model ensemble using a coordinated set of experiments. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) is the ideal framework within which to conduct such a study, due to the strong link to models being developed for the CMIP DECK experiments and other model intercomparison projects (MIPs). Increases in high-performance computing (HPC) resources, as well as the revised experimental design for CMIP6, now enable a detailed investigation of the impact of increased resolution up to synoptic weather scales on the simulated mean climate and its variability. The High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) presented in this paper applies, for the first time, a multi-model approach to the systematic investigation of the impact of horizontal resolution. A coordinated set of experiments has been designed to assess both a standard and an enhanced horizontal-resolution simulation in the atmosphere and ocean. The set of HighResMIP experiments is divided into three tiers consisting of atmosphere-only and coupled runs and spanning the period 1950-2050, with the possibility of extending to 2100, together with some additional targeted experiments. This paper describes the experimental set-up of HighResMIP, the analysis plan, the connection with the other CMIP6 endorsed MIPs, as well as the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations. HighResMIP thereby focuses on one of the CMIP6 broad questions, "what are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?", but we also discuss how it addresses the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) grand challenges.},

abstract = {The representation of nonlinear subgrid processes, especially clouds, has been a major source of uncertainty in climate models for decades. Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be run globally but only for short-term simulations of at most a few years because of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all atmospheric subgrid processes in a climate model by learning from a multiscale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural network then replaces the traditional subgrid parameterizations in a global general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multiyear simulations are stable and closely reproduce not only the mean climate of the cloud-resolving simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to. Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning for climate model parameterization. In a broader context, we anticipate that data-driven Earth system model development could play a key role in reducing climate prediction uncertainty in the coming decade.},

correlation between the records of precipitation at

the most recent decades. This relationship accounts
for up to 40{\%} of the variability on interannual to
decadal timescales, and seems to be driven by the
meridional circulation south of Australia that
simultaneously produces a northward flow of
relatively cool, dry air to southwest Western
Australia and a southward flow of warm, moist air to
East Antarctica. This pattern of meridional flow is
consistent with some projections of circulation
changes arising from anthropogenic climate
change. The precipitation anomaly of the past few
decades in Law Dome is the largest in 750 years, and
lies outside the range of variability for the record

abstract = {Droughts are one of the most devastating natural
hazards faced by the United States today. Severe
droughts of the twentieth century have had large
impacts on economies, society, and the environment,
especially in the Great Plains. However, the
instrumental record of the last 100 years contains
only a limited subset of drought realizations. One
must turn to the paleoclimatic record to examine the
full range of past drought variability, including
the range of magnitude and duration, and thus gain
the improved understanding needed for society to
anticipate and plan for droughts of the
future. Historical documents, tree rings,
archaeological remains, lake sediment, and
geomorphic data make it clear that the droughts of
the twentieth century, including those of the 1930s
and 1950s, were eclipsed several times by droughts
earlier in the last 2000 years, and as recently as
the late sixteenth century. In general, some
droughts prior to 1600 appear to be characterized by
longer duration (i.e., multidecadal) and greater
spatial extent than those of the twentieth
century. The authors' assessment of the full range
of past natural drought variability, deduced from a
comprehensive review of the paleoclimatic
literature, suggests that droughts more severe than
those of the 1930s and 1950s are likely to occur in
the future, a likelihood that might be exacerbated
by greenhouse warming in the next
century. Persistence conditions that lead to
decadal-scale drought may be related to

knowledge of past climate dynamics is critical for
assessing present and future constraints on the

initial results from two drill cores extracted from
the present-day edge of Lake Elsinore, southern
California's largest natural lake. Using a
multiproxy approach including lithologic

first-order forcing mechanisms that drive this
change, which include presence/absence of
continental ice sheets, insolation, and complex
ocean-atmosphere interactions. Our results indicate
four distinct millennial-scale climate modes over
the past 19 250 calendar years. These modes include
a wet Last Glacial Maximum (19 250-17 120 cal. yr

Holocene (9450-7670 cal. yr BP), and a highly
variable mid-to-late Holocene climate (i.e.,
alternating wet/dry cycles; 7670 cal. yr
BP-present). We attribute the mid-to-late Holocene

abstract = {Most historical sea surface temperature (SST) estimates indicate warmer World War II SSTs than expected from forcing and internal climate variability. If real, this World War II warm anomaly (WW2WA) has important implications for decadal variability, but the WW2WA may also arise from incomplete corrections of biases associated with bucket and engine room intake (ERI) measurements. To better assess the origins of the WW2WA, we develop five different historical SST estimates (reconstructions R1–R5). Using uncorrected SST measurements from the International Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) version 3.0 (R1) gives a WW2WA of 0.418C. In contrast, using only buckets (R2) or ERI observations (R3) gives WW2WAs of 0.188 and 0.088C, respectively, implying that uncorrected biases are the primary source of the WW2WA. We then use an extended linear-mixed-effect method to quantify systematic differences between subsets of SSTs and develop groupwise SST adjustments based on differences between pairs of nearby SST measurements. Using all measurements after applying groupwise adjustments (R4) gives a WW2WA of 0.138C [95{\%} confidence interval (c.i.): 0.018–0.268C] and indicates that U.S. and U.K. naval observations are the primary cause of the WW2WA. Finally, nighttime bucket SSTs are found to be warmer than their daytime counterparts during WW2, prompting a daytime-only reconstruction using groupwise adjustments (R5) that has a WW2WA of 0.098C (95{\%} c.i.: 20.018 to 0.188C). R5 is consistent with the range of internal variability found in either the CMIP5 (95{\%} c.i.: 20.108 to 0.108C) or CMIP6 ensembles (95{\%} c.i.: 20.118 to 0.108C). These results support the hypothesis that the WW2WA is an artifact of observational biases, although further data and metadata analyses will be important for confirmation.},

The authors also study the SAL simulated in the National Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmosphere Model, version 3 (CAM3), coupled with dust radiative effect. It is found that higher AOT is associated with warmer and dryer anomalies below 700 hPa, which increases the atmospheric stability.

abstract = {Under rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, the Arctic exhibits amplified warming relative to the globe. This Arctic amplification is a defining feature of global warming. However, the Arctic is also home to large internal variability, which can make the detection of a forced climate response difficult. Here we use results from seven model large ensembles, which have different rates of Arctic warming and sea ice loss, to assess the time of emergence of anthropogenically-forced Arctic amplification. We find that this time of emergence occurs at the turn of the century in all models, ranging across the models by a decade from 1994–2005. We also assess transient changes in this amplified signal across the 21st century and beyond. Over the 21st century, the projections indicate that the maximum Arctic warming will transition from fall to winter due to sea ice reductions that extend further into the fall. Additionally, the magnitude of the annual amplification signal declines over the 21st century associated in part with a weakening albedo feedback strength. In a simulation that extends to the 23rd century, we find that as sea ice cover is completely lost, there is little further reduction in the surface albedo and Arctic amplification saturates at a level that is reduced from its 21st century value.},

abstract = {An assessment is made of the global energy and
hydrological cycles from eight current atmospheric
reanalyses and their depiction of changes over
time. A brief evaluation of the water and energy
cycles in the latest version of the NCAR climate
model referred to as CCSM4 is also given. The focus
is on the mean ocean, land, and global precipitation
P; the corresponding evaporation E; their difference
corresponding to the surface freshwater flux E-P;
and the vertically integrated atmospheric moisture
transports. Using the model based P and E, the
time-and area-average E-P for the oceans, P-E for
land, and the moisture transport from ocean to land
should all be identical but are not close in most
reanalyses, and often differ significantly from
observational estimates of the surface return flow
based on net river discharge into the oceans. Their
differences reveal outstanding issues with
atmospheric models and their biases, which are
manifested as analysis increments in the
reanalyses. The NCAR CCSM4, along with most
reanalysis models, the exception being MERRA, has
too-intense water cycling (P and E) over the ocean
although ocean-to-land transports are very close to
observed. Precipitation from reanalyses that
assimilate moisture from satellite observations
exhibits large changes identified with the changes
in the observing system, as new and improved
temperature and water vapor channels are assimilated
and, while P improves after about 2002, E-P does
not. Discrepancies among hydrological cycle
components arise from analysis increments that can
add or subtract moisture. The large-scale moisture
budget divergences are more stable in time and
similar across reanalyses than model-based estimates
of E-P. Results are consistent with the view that
recycling of moisture is too large in most models
and the lifetime of moisture is too short. For the
energy cycle, most reanalyses have spurious
imbalances of similar to 10 W m(-2) within the
atmosphere, and similar to 5-10 W m(-2) in net
fluxes into the surface and to space. Major
improvements are needed in model treatment and
assimilation of moisture, and surface fluxes from
reanalyses should only be used with great caution.},

abstract = {The Bosumtwi impact crater in Ghana, arguably the
best-preserved complex young impact structure known
on Earth, displays a pronounced rim and is almost
completely filled by Lake Bosumtwi, a hydrologically
closed basin. It is the source crater of the Ivory
Coast tektites. The structure was excavated in
2.1-2.2 Gyr old metasediments and metavolcanics of
the Birimian Supergroup. A drilling project was
conceived that would combine two major scientific
interests in this crater: 1) to obtain a complete
paleoenvironmental record from the time of crater
formation about one million years ago, at a
near-equatorial location in Africa for which very
few data are available so far, and 2) to obtain a
complete record of impactites at the central uplift
and in the crater moat, for ground truthing and
comparison with other structures. Within the
framework of an international and multidisciplinary
drilling project led by the International
Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP), 16
drill cores were obtained from June to October 2004
at six locations within Lake Bosumtwi, which is 8.5
kin in diameter. The 14 sediment cores are currently
being investigated for paleoenvironmental
indicators. The two impactite cores LB-07A and
LB-08A were drilled into the deepest section of the
annular moat (540 in) and the flank of the central
uplift (450 in), respectively. They are the main
subject of this special issue of Meteoritics {\&}
Planetary Science, which represents the first
detailed presentations of results from the deep
drilling into the Bosumtwi impactite
sequence. Drilling progressed in both cases through
the impact breccia, layer into fractured
bedrock. LB-07A comprises lithic (in the uppermost
part) and suevitic impact breccias with appreciable
amounts of impact melt fragments. The lithic clast
content is dominated by graywacke, besides various
metapelites, quartzite, and a carbonate target
component. Shock deformation in the form of quartz
grains with planar microdeformations is
abundant. First chemical results indicate a number
of suevite samples that are strongly enriched in
siderophile elements and Mg, but the presence of a
definite meteoritic component in these samples
cannot be confirmed due to high indigenous
values. Core LB-08A comprises suevitic breccia in
the uppermost part, followed with depth by a thick
sequence of graywacke-dominated metasediment with
suevite and a few granitoid dike intercalations. It
is assumed that the metasediment package represents
bedrock intersected in the flank of the central
uplift. Both 7A and 8A suevite intersections differ
from suevites outside of the northern crater rim.
Deep drilling results confirmed the gross structure
of the crater as imaged by the pre-drilling seismic
surveys. Borehole geophysical studies conducted in
the two boreholes confirmed the low seismic
velocities for the post-impact sediments (less than
1800 m/s) and the impactites (2600-3300 m/s). The
impactites exhibit very high porosities (up to 30
vol{\%}), which has important implications for
mechanical rock stability. The statistical analysis
of the velocities and densities reveals a
seismically transparent impactite sequence (free of
prominent internal reflections). Petrophysical core
analyses provide no support for the presence of a
homogeneous magnetic unit (= melt breccia) within
the center of the structure. Borehole vector
magnetic data point to a patchy distribution of
highly magnetic rocks within the impactite sequence.
The lack of a coherent melt sheet, or indeed of any
significant amounts of melt rock in the crater fill,
is in contrast to expectations from modeling and
pre-drilling geophysics, and presents an interesting
problem for comparative studies and requires
re-evaluation of existing data from other
terrestrial impact craters, as well as modeling
parameters.},

abstract = {Decadal Sahelian rainfall variability was mainly
driven by sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during the
twentieth century. At the same time SSTs showed a
marked long-term global warming (GW)
trend. Superimposed on this long-term trend decadal
and multi-decadal variability patterns are observed
like the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and
the inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Using
an atmospheric general circulation model we
investigate the relative contribution of each
component to the Sahelian precipitation
variability. To take into account the uncertainty
related to the use of different SST data sets, we
perform the experiments using HadISST1 and ERSSTv3
reconstructed sets. The simulations show that all
three SST signals have a significant impact over
West Africa: the positive phases of the GW and the
IPO lead to drought over the Sahel, while a positive
AMO enhances Sahel rainfall. The tropical SST
warming is the main cause for the GW impact on Sahel
rainfall. Regarding the AMO, the pattern of
anomalous precipitation is established by the SSTs
in the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. In turn,
the tropical SST anomalies control the impact of the
IPO component on West Africa. Our results suggest
that the low-frequency evolution of Sahel rainfall
can be interpreted as the competition of three
factors: the effect of the GW, the AMO and the
IPO. Following this interpretation, our results show
that 50{\%} of the SST-driven Sahel drought in the
1980s is explained by the change to a negative phase
of the AMO, and that the GW contribution was
10{\%}. In addition, the partial recovery of Sahel
rainfall in recent years was mainly driven by the
AMO.},

In the warm Arctic winter, DLR and precipitable water (PW) are increasing over the entire Arctic; however, the major drivers for such increases differ regionally. In areas such as the northern Greenland Sea, increasing DLR and PW are caused mainly by convergence of atmospheric energy transport from lower latitudes. In regions of maximum sea-ice retreat (e.g., northern Barents–Kara seas), continued sea-ice melting from previous seasons drive the DLR and PW increases, consistent with the positive ice-insulation feedback. Distinct local feedbacks between open-water and ice-retreat regions were further compared. In open-water regions, a reduced ocean–atmosphere temperat...},

abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are characterized by intense moisture transport, which, on landfall, produce precipitation which can be both beneficial and destructive. ARs in California, for example, are known to have ended drought conditions but also to have caused substantial socio-economic damage from landslides and flooding linked to extreme precipitation. Understanding how AR characteristics will respond to a warming climate is, therefore, vital to the resilience of communities affected by them, such as the western USA, Europe, East Asia and South Africa. In this Review, we use a theoretical framework to synthesize understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic responses of ARs to anthropogenic warming and connect them to observed and projected changes and impacts revealed by observations and complex models. Evidence suggests that increased atmospheric moisture (governed by Clausius–Clapeyron scaling) will enhance the intensity of AR-related precipitation — and related hydrological extremes — but with changes that are ultimately linked to topographic barriers. However, due to their dependency on both weather and climate-scale processes, which themselves are often poorly constrained, projections are uncertain. To build confidence and improve resilience, future work must focus efforts on characterizing the multiscale development of ARs and in obtaining observations from understudied regions, including the West Pacific, South Pacific and South Atlantic. Due to their intense moisture transport, atmospheric rivers are associated with hydrological hazards such as extreme rainfall and flooding. This Review discusses how atmospheric-river characteristics and impacts may change with warming, synthesizing physical theory, observations and modelling.},

Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

abstract = {In 2005, large sections of southwestern Amazonia
experienced one of the most intense droughts of the
last hundred years. The drought severely affected
human population along the main channel of the
Amazon River and its western and southwestern
tributaries, the Solimoes (also known as the Amazon
River in the other Amazon countries) and the Madeira
Rivers, respectively. The river levels fell to
historic low levels and navigation along these
rivers had to be suspended. The drought did not
affect central or eastern Amazonia, a pattern
different from the El Nino-related droughts in 1926,
1983, and 1998. The choice of rainfall data used
influenced the detection of the drought. While most
datasets (station or gridded data) showed negative
departures from mean rainfall, one dataset exhibited
above-normal rainfall in western Amazonia. The
causes of the drought were not related to El Nino
but to (i) the anomalously warm tropical North
Atlantic, (ii) the reduced intensity in northeast
trade wind moisture transport into southern Amazonia
during the peak summertime season, and (iii) the
weakened upward motion over this section of
Amazonia, resulting in reduced convective
development and rainfall. The drought conditions
were intensified during the dry season into
September 2005 when humidity was lower than normal
and air temperatures were 3 degrees-5 degrees C
warmer than normal. Because of the extended dry
season in the region, forest fires affected part of
southwestern Amazonia. Rains returned in October
2005 and generated flooding after February 2006.},

recovered from Saanicb Inlet have been analysed
using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy

processes. Sediment flux comprises alternating
diatom ooze/diatomaceous mud deposited during spring
through autumn and a silty-clay deposited during
winter. The latter may be sporadically punctuated by
clay-rich laminae. Identification of some 2000
individual consecutive laminae, based on fabric and
diatom assemblage, has allowed the construction of
time series data for spectral analysis. Laminae
types analysed include: early spring Thalassiosira
spp., late spring/early summer Skeletonema costatum,
multiple summer/autumn Chaetoceros spp. diatom oozes
and sporadically present clay-rich winter flood
deposits. Sub-decadal periods have been identified
and linked to the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO)
and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and decadal
periods to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
(PDO). Comparison of spectral analysis results with
modem analogues suggests associations may exist
between: early spring Pialassiosira spp. laminae and
stronger La Nina events; late spring/early summer
S. costatum laminae and El Nino events;
summer/autumn Chaetoceros spp. multiple laminae and
negative Pacific Northwest Index (PNI) regimes; and
sporadically present winter clay-rich laminae and
PNI-regimes. The average period for an ENSO cycle
was 3.6 years, QBO 2.5 years and PDO 14.8
years. Spectral analysis of the more recent PNI

abstract = {The Arctic has experienced a warming rate higher than the global mean in the past decades, but previous studies show that there are large uncertainties associated with future Arctic temperature projections. In this study, nearsurface mean temperatures in the Arctic are analyzed from 22 models participating in phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Compared with the ERA5 reanalysis, most CMIP6 models underestimate the observed mean temperature in the Arctic during 1979-2014. The largest cold biases are found over the Greenland Sea the Barents Sea, and the Kara Sea. Under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, the multimodel ensemble mean of 22 CMIP6 models exhibits significant Arctic warming in the future and the warming rate is more than twice that of the global/Northern Hemisphere mean. Model spread is the largest contributor to the overall uncertainty in projections, which accounts for 55.4{\%} of the total uncertainty at the start of projections in 2015 and remains at 32.9{\%} at the end of projections in 2095. Internal variability uncertainty accounts for 39.3{\%} of the total uncertainty at the start of projections but decreases to 6.5{\%} at the end of the twenty-first century, while scenario uncertainty rapidly increases from 5.3{\%} to 60.7{\%} over the period from 2015 to 2095. It is found that the largest model uncertainties are consistent cold bias in the oceanic regions in the models, which is connected with excessive sea ice area caused by the weak Atlantic poleward heat transport. These results suggest that large intermodel spread and uncertainties exist in the CMIP6 models' simulation and projection of the Arctic nearsurface temperature and that there are different responses over the ocean and land in the Arctic to greenhouse gas forcing. Future research needs to pay more attention to the different characteristics and mechanisms of Arctic Ocean and land warming to reduce the spread.},

All 24 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 models agree on these changes and, over the twenty-first century, average a phase delay of 5 days and an amplitude decrease of 5{\%} for the global mean ocean surface temperature. Evidence is provided that the changes are mainly driven by sea ice loss: as sea ice melts during the twenty-first century, the previously unexposed open ocean increases the effective heat capacity of the surface layer, slowing and damping the temperature response. From the tropics to the midlatitudes, changes in phase and amplitude are smaller and less spatially uniform than near the poles but are still preva...},

abstract = {We discuss 3D global simulations of the early martian climate that we have performed assuming a faint young Sun and denser CO2 atmosphere. We include a self-consistent representation of the water cycle, with atmosphere–surface interactions, atmospheric transport, and the radiative effects of CO2 and H2O gas and clouds taken into account. We find that for atmospheric pressures greater than a fraction of a bar, the adiabatic cooling effect causes temperatures in the southern highland valley network regions to fall significantly below the global average. Long-term climate evolution simulations indicate that in these circumstances, water ice is transported to the highlands from low-lying regions for a wide range of orbital obliquities, regardless of the extent of the Tharsis bulge. In addition, an extended water ice cap forms on the southern pole, approximately corresponding to the location of the Noachian/Hesperian era Dorsa Argentea Formation. Even for a multiple-bar CO2 atmosphere, conditions are too cold to allow long-term surface liquid water. Limited melting occurs on warm summer days in some locations, but only for surface albedo and thermal inertia conditions that may be unrealistic for water ice. Nonetheless, meteorite impacts and volcanism could potentially cause intense episodic melting under such conditions. Because ice migration to higher altitudes is a robust mechanism for recharging highland water sources after such events, we suggest that this globally sub-zero, ‘icy highlands' scenario for the late Noachian climate may be sufficient to explain most of the fluvial geology without the need to invoke additional long-term warming mechanisms or an early warm, wet Mars.},

Through model experimentation, the first step in this chain is examined by quantifying contributions of various physical factors to October–December (OND) mean Arctic tropospheric warming since 1979. The results indicate that the main factors responsible for Arctic tropospheric warming are recent decadal fluctuations and long-term changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), both located outside the Arctic.

Further, given the relationship between the North Pacific jet stream and North American weather regimes, we also examine the changes in surface temperature variability over North America. The four climate models investigated here exhibit robust agreement in both sign and structure of the atmospheric responses, with a strengthened wintertime North Pacific jet, an increase in anomalously strong and extended jet events, and a decreased frequency of weakened and equatorward-shifted jet events in response to reduced Arctic sea ice. The models also show changes in wintertime, North American surface temperature patterns that are consistent with the zonal wind changes seen in the North Pacific. There is an increase in the frequency of occurrence of the North American temperature dipole pattern, defined as anomalously warm temperatures in the west or northwest and anomalously cold temperatures in the east or southeast, and a decrease in the frequency of anomalously cold temperatures over North America.},

Although it is possible to calculate Arctic sea ice thickness using measurements acquired by CryoSat-2, the latency of the final release data set is typically 1 month due to the time required to determine precise satellite orbits. We use a new fast-delivery CryoSat-2 data set based on preliminary orbits to compute Arctic sea ice thickness in near real time (NRT), and analyse this data for one sea ice growth season from October 2014 to April 2015. We show that this NRT sea-ice-thickness product is of comparable accuracy to that produced using the final release CryoSat-2 data, with a mean thickness difference of 0.9 cm, demonstrating that the satellite orbit is not a critical factor in determining sea ice freeboard. In addition, the CryoSat-2 fast-delivery product also provides measurements of Arctic sea ice thickness within 3 days of acquisition by the satellite, and a measurement is delivered, on average, within 14, 7 and 6 km of each location in the Arctic every 2, 14 and 28 days respectively. The CryoSat-2 NRT sea-ice-thickness data set provides an additional constraint for short-term and seasonal predictions of changes in the Arctic ice cover and could support industries such as tourism and transport through assimilation in operational models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {No current tree ring (TR) based reconstruction of
extratropical Northern Hemisphere (ENH) temperatures
that extends into the 1990s captures the full range
of late 20th century warming observed in the
instrumental record. Over recent decades, a
divergence between cooler reconstructed and warmer
instrumental large-scale temperatures is
observed. We hypothesize that this problem is partly
related to the fact that some of the constituent
chronologies used for previous reconstructions show
divergence against local temperatures in the recent
period. In this study, we compiled TR data and
published local/regional reconstructions that show
no divergence against local temperatures. These data
have not been included in other large-scale
temperature reconstructions. Utilizing this data
set, we developed a new, completely independent
reconstruction of ENH annual temperatures
(1750-2000). This record is not meant to replace
existing reconstructions but allows some degree of
independent validation of these earlier studies as
well as demonstrating that TR data can better model
recent warming at large scales when careful
selection of constituent chronologies is made at the
local scale. Although the new series tracks the
increase in ENH annual temperatures over the last
few decades better than any existing reconstruction,
it still slightly under predicts values in the
post-1988 period. We finally discuss possible
reasons why it is so difficult to model
post-mid-1980s warming, provide some possible
alternative approaches with regards to the
instrumental target and detail several
recommendations that should be followed in future
large-scale reconstruction attempts that may result
in more robust temperature estimates.},

abstract = {According to tree ring and other records, a series
of severe droughts that lasted for decades afflicted
western North America during the Medieval period
resulting in a more arid climate than in subsequent
centuries. A review of proxy evidence from around
the world indicates that North American megadroughts
were part of a global pattern of Medieval
hydroclimate that was distinct from that of
today. In particular, the Medieval hydroclimate was
wet in northern South America, dry in mid-latitude
South America, dry in eastern Africa but with strong
Nile River floods and a strong Indian monsoon. This
pattern is similar to that accompanying persistent
North American droughts in the instrumental
era. This pattern is compared to that associated
with familiar climate phenomena. The best fit comes
from a persistently La Ni (n) over tildea-like
tropical Pacific and the warm phase of the so-called
Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. A positive North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) also helps to explain the
Medieval hydroclimate pattern. Limited sea surface
temperature reconstructions support the contention
that the tropical Pacific was cold and the
subtropical North Atlantic was warm, ideal
conditions for North American drought. Tentative
modeling results indicate that a multi-century La Ni
(n) over tildea-like state could have arisen as a
coupled atmosphere-ocean response to high irradiance
and weak volcanism during the Medieval period and
that this could in turn have induced a persistently
positive NAO state. A La Ni (n) over tildea-like
state could also induce a strengthening of the North
Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and
hence warming of the North Atlantic Ocean, by (i)
the ocean response to the positive NAO and by
shifting the southern mid-latitude westerlies
poleward which (ii) will increase the salt flux from
the Indian Ocean into the South Atlantic and (iii)
drive stronger Southern Ocean upwelling. (C) 2007

ITCZ and the associated monsoon front at the time of
the Younger Dryas. Two drought episodes occurred at
8.4 and 7.5 cal kyr BP, and are also interpreted as
a southward shift in the monsoon front. The first of
these events appears to have preceded and been more
significant than the 8.2 cal kyr BP. Precipitation
declined after 6.8 cal kyr BP, although we do not
see an abrupt end to the African Humid Period. This

around 11.0 and 6.2 ka, tropical diatoms and

central Gulf, as relatively cooler and fresher
surface waters resembling those of the modem
northern Gulf were present in the central

probably did not occur until after about 5.4 ka,
when tropical diatoms and silicoflagellates became
relatively common in the central Gulf. Modem
east-west contrasts, which arise from late
winter-early spring coastal upwelling on the

western side of the Gulf, commenced between 6.2 and
5.4 ka, possibly due to a shift in the direction of
late winter-early spring winds more towards the
southeast, or down the axis of the Gulf This
proposed wind shift might have ultimately been due
to a late Holocene strengthening of ENSO-like

region. A formal model-based detection and
attribution (D-A) study of these reductions is
performed. The detection variable is the ratio of 1
April snow water equivalent (SWE) to
water-year-to-date precipitation (P), chosen to
reduce the effect of P variability on the
results. Estimates of natural internal climate
variability are obtained from 1600 years of two
control simulations performed with fully coupled
ocean-atmosphere climate models. Estimates of the
SWE/P response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases,
ozone, and some aerosols are taken from
multiple-member ensembles of perturbation
experiments run with two models. The D-A shows the
observations and anthropogenically forced models
have greater SWE/P reductions than can be explained
by natural internal climate variability alone.
Model-estimated effects of changes in solar and
volcanic forcing likewise do not explain the SWE/P
reductions. The mean model estimate is that about
half of the SWE/P reductions observed in the west
from 1950 to 1999 are the result of climate changes
forced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, and

abstract = {This study examines the response of the tropical
atmospheric and oceanic circulation to increasing
greenhouse gases using a coordinated set of
twenty-first-century climate model experiments
performed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The
strength of the atmospheric overturning circulation
decreases as the climate warms in all IPCC AR4
models, in a manner consistent with the
thermodynamic scaling arguments of Held and
Soden. The weakening occurs preferentially in the
zonally asymmetric (i.e., Walker) rather than
zonal-mean (i.e., Hadley)component of the tropical
circulation and is shown to induce substantial
changes to the thermal structure and circulation of
the tropical oceans. Evidence suggests that the
overall circulation weakens by decreasing the
frequency of strong updrafts and increasing the
frequency of weak updrafts, although the robustness
of this behavior across all models cannot be
confirmed because of the lack of data. As the
climate warms, changes in both the atmospheric and
ocean circulation over the tropical Pacific Ocean
resemble "El Nino-like" conditions; however, the
mechanisms are shown to be distinct from those of El
Nino and are reproduced in both mixed layer and full
ocean dynamics coupled climate models. The character
of the Indian Ocean response to global warming
resembles that of Indian Ocean dipole mode
events. The consensus of model results presented
here is also consistent with recently detected
changes in sea level pressure since the
mid-nineteenth century.},

abstract = {The CSIRO Mark 2 coupled global climatic model has
been used to generate a 10,000-year simulation for
'present' climatic conditions. The model output has
been analysed to identify sustained climatic
fluctuations, such as those attributed to the
Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age
(LIA). Since no external forcing was permitted
during the model run all such fluctuations are
attributed to naturally occurring climatic
variability associated with the nonlinear processes
inherent in the climatic system. Comparison of
simulated climatic time series for different
geographical locations highlighted the lack of
synchronicity between these series. The model was
found to be able to simulate climatic extremes for
selected observations for century timescales, as
well as identifying the associated spatial
characteristics. Other examples of time series
simulated by the model for the USA and eastern
Russia had similar characteristics to those
attributed to the MWP and the LIA, but smaller
amplitudes, and clearly defined spatial patterns. A
search for the frequency of occurrence of specified
surface temperature anomalies, defined via duration
and mean value, revealed that these were primarily
confined to polar regions and northern latitudes of
Europe, Asia and North America. Over the majority of
the oceans and southern hemisphere such climatic
fluctuations could not be sustained, for reasons
explained in the paper. Similarly, sustained sea-ice
anomalies were mainly confined to the northern
hemisphere. An examination of mechanisms associated
with the sustained climatic fluctuations failed to
identify a role for the North Atlantic Oscillation,
the El Nino-Southern Oscillation or the Pacific
Decadal Oscillation. It was therefore concluded that
these fluctuations were generated by stochastic
processes intrinsic to the nonlinear climatic
system. While a number of characteristics of the MWP
and the LIA could have been partially caused by
natural processes within the climatic system, the
inability of the model to reproduce the observed
hemispheric mean temperature anomalies associated
with these events indicates that external forcing
must have been involved. Essentially the unforced
climatic system is unable to sustain the generation
of long-term climatic anomalies.},

This study evaluates the spatial and temporal variability in Arctic sea ice thickness using the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS). Additionally, the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble Project (LENS) is used to quantify the forced response and internal variability in the model. A dipole spatial pattern of sea ice thickness variability is shown in both PIOMAS and LENS with opposite signs of polarity between the East Siberian Sea and near the Fram Strait. As future sea ice thins, this dipole structure of variability is reduced, and the largest interannual variability is found only along the northern Greenland coastline. Under a high-emissions scenario (RCP8.5) projection, average September sea ice thickness falls below 0.5 m by the end of the twenty-first cent...},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We introduce a diagnostic tool to assess a climatological framework of the optimal propagation conditions for stationary planetary waves. Analyzing 50 winters using NCEP/NCAR (National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research) reanalysis data we derive probability density functions (PDFs) of positive vertical wave number as a function of zonal and meridional wave numbers. We contrast this quantity with classical climatological means of the vertical wave number. Introducing a membership value function (MVF) based on fuzzy logic, we objectively generate a modified set of PDFs (mPDFs) and demonstrate their superior performance compared to the climatological mean of vertical wave number and the original PDFs. We argue that mPDFs allow an even better understanding of how background conditions impact wave propagation in a climatological sense. As expected, probabilities are decreasing with increasing zonal wave numbers. In addition we discuss the meridional wave number dependency of the PDFs which is usually neglected, highlighting the contribution of meridional wave numbers 2 and 3 in the stratosphere. We also describe how mPDFs change in response to strong vortex regime (SVR) and weak vortex regime (WVR) conditions, with increased probabilities of the wave propagation during WVR than SVR in the stratosphere. We conclude that the mPDFs are a convenient way to summarize climatological information about planetary wave propagation in reanalysis and climate model data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Analysis of data sets based upon observations reveals a 1.11 K per decade surface warming trend in the Arctic (70°–90°N) during 1979–2020 cold season (October–February) that is five times higher than the corresponding global mean. Based on surface energy budget analysis, we show that the largest contribution (∼82{\%}) to this cold season warming trend is attributed to changes in clear-sky downward longwave radiation. In contrast to that in Arctic summer and over tropics, a reduction in lower-tropospheric inversions plays a unique role in explaining the reduction of the downward longwave radiation associated with atmospheric nonuniform temperature and corresponding moisture changes. Our analyses also suggest that Arctic lower-tropospheric stability should be considered in conjunction with sea-ice decline during the preceding warm season to explain AA.},

abstract = {Rapid changes are occurring in the Arctic, including a reduction in sea ice thickness and coverage and a shift towards younger and thinner sea ice. Snow and sea ice models are often used to study these ongoing changes in the Arctic, and are typically forced by atmospheric reanalyses in absence of observations. ERA5 is a new global reanalysis that will replace the widely used ERA-Interim (ERA-I). In this study, we compare the 2{\&}thinsp;m air temperature (T2M), snowfall (SF) and total precipitation (TP) from ERA-I and ERA5, and evaluate these products using buoy observations from Arctic sea ice for the years 2010 to 2016. We further assess how biases in reanalyses can influence the snow and sea ice evolution in the Arctic, when used to force a thermodynamic sea ice model. We find that ERA5 is generally warmer than ERA-I in winter and spring (0-1.2{\&}thinsp;C), but colder than ERA-I in summer and autumn (0-0.6{\&}thinsp;C) over Arctic sea ice. Both reanalyses have a warm bias over Arctic sea ice relative to buoy observations. The warm bias is smaller in the warm season, and larger in the cold season, especially when the T2M is below -25C in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors. Interestingly, the warm bias for ERA-I and new ERA5 is on average 3.4 and 5.4{\&}thinsp;C (daily mean), respectively, when T2M is lower than -25C. The TP and SF along the buoy trajectories and over Arctic sea ice are consistently higher in ERA5 than in ERA-I. Over Arctic sea ice, the TP in ERA5 is typically less than 10{\&}thinsp;mm snow water equivalent (SWE) greater than in ERA-I in any of the seasons, while the SF in ERA5 can be 50{\&}thinsp;mm SWE higher than in ERA-I in a season. The largest increase in annual TP (40-100{\&}thinsp;mm) and SF (100-200{\&}thinsp;mm) in ERA5 occurs in the Atlantic sector. The SF to TP ratio is larger in ERA5 than in ERA-I, on average 0.6 for ERA-I and 0.8 for ERA5 along the buoy trajectories. Thus, the substantial anomalous Arctic rainfall in ERA-I is reduced in ERA5, especially in summer and autumn. Simulations with a 1-D thermodynamic sea ice model demonstrate that the warm bias in ERA5 acts to reduce thermodynamic ice growth. The higher precipitation and snowfall in ERA5 results in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat loss to the atmosphere. Thus, the larger winter warm bias and higher precipitation in ERA5, compared with ERA-I, result in thinner ice thickness at the end of the growth season when using ERA5; however the effect is small during the freezing period..},

abstract = {The response of marine and terrestrial environments to global changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentrations will likely be governed by both responses to direct environmental forcing and responses to Earth-system feedbacks induced by that forcing. It has been proposed that anthropogenic greenhouse forcing will intensify coastal upwelling in eastern boundary current regions [Bakun, A. (1990) Science 247, 198-201]. Focusing on the California Current, we show that biophysical land-cover-atmosphere feedbacks induced by CO(2) radiative forcing enhance the radiative effects of CO(2) on land-sea thermal contrast, resulting in changes in eastern boundary current total seasonal upwelling and upwelling seasonality. Specifically, relative to CO(2) radiative forcing, land-cover-atmosphere feedbacks lead to a stronger increase in peak- and late-season near-shore upwelling in the northern limb of the California Current and a stronger decrease in peak- and late-season near-shore upwelling in the southern limb. Such changes will impact both marine and terrestrial communities [Bakun, A. (1990) Science 247, 198-201; Soto, C. G. (2001) Rev. Fish Biol. Fish. 11, 181-195; and Agostini, V. N. {\&} Bakun, A.

@article{lean05,
abstract = {An array of empirical evidence in the space era, and
in the past, suggests that climate responds to solar
activity. The response mechanisms are thought to be
some combination of direct surface heating, indirect
processes involving UV radiation and the
stratosphere, and modulation of internal climate
system oscillations. A quantitative physical
description is, as yet, lacking to explain the
empirical evidence in terms of the known magnitude
of solar radiative output changes and of climate
sensitivity to these changes. Reproducing
solar-induced decadal climate change requires faster
and larger responses than general circulation models
allow. Nor is the indirect climatic impact of
solar-induced stratospheric change adequately
understood, in part because of uncertainties in the
vertical coupling of the stratosphere and
troposphere. Accounting for solar effects on
pre-industrial surface temperatures requires larger
irradiance variations than present in the
contemporary database, but evidence for significant
secular irradiance change is ambiguous. Essential
for future progress are reliable, extended
observations of the solar radiative output changes
that produce climate forcing. Twenty-five years
after the beginning of continuous monitoring of the
Sun's total radiative output, the Solar Radiation
and Climate Experiment (SORCE) commences a new
generation of solar irradiance measurements with
much expanded capabilities. Relative to historical
solar observations SORCE monitors both total and
spectral irradiance with significantly reduced
uncertainty and increased repeatability, especially
on long time scales. Spectral coverage expands
beyond UV wavelengths to encompass the visible and
near-IR regions that dominate the Sun's radiative
output. The space-based irradiance record, augmented
now with the spectrum of the changes, facilitates
improved characterization of magnetic sources of
irradiance variability, and the detection of
additional mechanisms. This understanding provides a
scientific basis for estimating past and future
irradiance variations, needed for detecting and
predicting climate change.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to quantify climatic
controls on the area burned by. re in different
vegetation types in the western United States. We
demonstrate that wild. re area burned (WFAB) in the
American West was controlled by climate during the
20th century (1916-2003). Persistent
ecosystem-specific correlations between climate and
WFAB are grouped by vegetation type
(ecoprovinces). Most mountainous ecoprovinces
exhibit strong year-of-fire relationships with low
precipitation, low Palmer drought severity index
(PDSI), and high temperature. Grass-and
shrub-dominated ecoprovinces had positive
relationships with antecedent precipitation or
PDSI. For 1977-2003, a few climate variables explain
33-87{\%} (mean = 64{\%}) of WFAB, indicating strong
linkages between climate and area burned. For
1916-2003, the relationships are weaker, but climate
explained 25-57{\%} (mean = 39{\%}) of the
variability. The variance in WFAB is proportional to
the mean squared for different data sets at
different spatial scales. The importance of
antecedent climate (summer drought in forested
ecosystems and antecedent winter precipitation in
shrub and grassland ecosystems) indicates that the
mechanism behind the observed. re-climate
relationships is climatic preconditioning of large
areas of low fuel moisture via drying of existing
fuels or fuel production and drying. The impacts of
climate change on. re regimes will therefore vary
with the relative energy or water limitations of
ecosystems. Ecoprovinces proved a useful compromise
between ecologically imprecise state-level and
localized gridded fire data. The differences in
climate . re relationships among the ecoprovinces
underscore the need to consider ecological context
(vegetation, fuels, and seasonal climate) to
identify specific climate drivers of WFAB. Despite
the possible influence of. re suppression,
exclusion, and fuel treatment, WFAB is still
substantially controlled by climate. The
implications for planning and management are that
future WFAB and adaptation to climate change will
likely depend on ecosystem-specific, seasonal
variation in climate. In fuel-limited ecosystems,
fuel treatments can probably mitigate. re
vulnerability and increase resilience more readily
than in climate-limited ecosystems, in which large

We describe a set of national indicators that reflect sub-seasonal to seasonal drivers and responses of terrestrial physical and biological systems to climate change and variability at the national scale. Proposed indicators and metrics include seasonality of surface climate conditions (e.g., frost and freeze dates and durations), seasonality of freeze/thaw in freshwater systems (e.g., timing of stream runoff and durations of lake/river ice), seasonality in ecosystem disturbances (e.g., wildfire season timing and duration), seasonality in vegetated land surfaces (e.g., green-up and brown-down of landscapes), and seasonality of organismal life-history stages (e.g., timings of bird migration).

abstract = {Despite the increasingly successful application of neural networks to many problems in the geosciences, their complex and nonlinear structure makes the interpretation of their predictions difficult, which limits model trust and does not allow scientists to gain physical insights about the problem at hand. Many different methods have been introduced in the emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aim at attributing the network's prediction to specific features in the input domain. XAI methods are usually assessed by using benchmark datasets (like MNIST or ImageNet for image classification), or through deletion/insertion techniques. In either case, however, an objective, theoretically-derived ground truth for the attribution is lacking, making the assessment of XAI in many cases subjective. Also, benchmark datasets for problems in geosciences are rare. Here, we provide a framework, based on the use of additively separable functions, to generate attribution benchmark datasets for regression problems for which the ground truth of the attribution is known a priori. We generate a long benchmark dataset and train a fully-connected network to learn the underlying function that was used for simulation. We then compare estimated attribution heatmaps from different XAI methods to the ground truth in order to identify examples where specific XAI methods perform well or poorly. We believe that attribution benchmarks as the ones introduced herein are of great importance for further application of neural networks in the geosciences, and for accurate implementation of XAI methods, which will increase model trust and assist in discovering new science.},

Here we apply causal discovery algorithms to sea level pressure data from a large set of climate model simulations and, as a proxy for observations, meteorological reanalyses. We demonstrate how the resulting causal networks (fingerprints) offer an objective pathway for process-oriented model evaluation. Models with fingerprints closer to observations better reproduce important precipitation patterns over highly populated areas such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, East Asia, Europe and North America. We further identify expected model interdependencies due to shared development backgrounds. Finally, our network metrics provide stronger relationships for constraining precipitation projections under climate change as compared to traditional evaluation metrics for storm tracks or precipitation itself. Such emergent relationships highlight the potential of causal networks to constrain longstanding uncertainties in climate change projections. Algorithms to assess causal relationships in data sets have seen increasing applications in climate science in recent years. Here, the authors show that these techniques can help to systematically evaluate the performance of climate models and, as a result, to constrain uncertainties in future climate change projections.},

@article{lean00_solar_indices,
abstract = {Indices of solar activity relevant for understanding
and modelling solar irradiance variability are
identified, and their temporal characteristics
compared. Reproducing observed solar irradiance
variability requires a minimum of two different
types of indices - an index for irradiance depletion
by sunspots and an index for global irradiance
enhancement by faculae and network. When combined
with appropriate wavelength-dependent
parameterizations of sunspot and facular contrasts
and center-to-limb functions, these indices permit
the construction of empirical models of daily,
monthly and annual solar total and spectral
irradiances. The models are compared with
observations at selected wavelengths and for the
total irradiance. While the models replicate much of
the rotational and 11-year cycle variance in
contemporary irradiance databases, differences exist
because of either the presence of variability
mechanisms additional to solar magnetism, or of
unresolved instrumental effects in the
databases. The reconstruction of solar irradiance in
the past requires speculation about the extent of
intercycle fluctuations in the global facular index,
or in other, as yet unspecified, variability
mechanisms.},

abstract = {Previous studies have extensively investigated the impact of Arctic sea ice anomalies on the midlatitude circulation and associated surface climate in winter. However, there is an ongoing scientific debate regarding whether and how sea ice retreat results in the observed cold anomaly over the adjacent continents. We present a robust “cold Siberia” pattern in the winter following sea ice loss over the Barents-Kara seas in late autumn in an advanced atmospheric general circulation model, with a well-resolved stratosphere. Additional targeted experiments reveal that the stratospheric response to sea ice forcing is crucial in the development of cold conditions over Siberia, indicating the dominant role of the stratospheric pathway compared with the direct response within the troposphere. In particular, the downward influence of the stratospheric circulation anomaly significantly intensifies the ridge near the Ural Mountains and the trough over East Asia. The persistently intensified ridge and trough favor more frequent cold air outbreaks and colder winters over Siberia. This finding has important implications for improving seasonal climate prediction of midlatitude cold events. The results also suggest that the model performance in representing the stratosphere-troposphere coupling could be an important source of the discrepancy between recent studies.},

abstract = {Recent observational and modeling studies have demonstrated a link between eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (TPO) warming associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the negative phase of the wintertime northern annular mode (NAM). The TPO–NAM link involves a Rossby wave teleconnection from the tropics to the extratropics, and an increase in polar stratospheric wave driving that in turn induces a negative NAM anomaly in the stratosphere and troposphere. Previous work further suggests that tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) warming is associated with a positive NAM anomaly, which is of opposite sign to the TPO case. The TIO case is, however, difficult to interpret because the TPO and TIO warmings are not independent. To better understand the dynamics of tropical influences on the NAM, the current study investigates the NAM response to imposed TPO and TIO warmings in a general circulation model.

@article{seager05,
abstract = {The causes of persistent droughts and wet periods,
or pluvials, over western North America are examined
in model simulations of the period from 1856 to
2000. The simulations used either (i) global sea
surface temperature data as a lower boundary
condition or (ii) observed data in just the tropical
Pacific and computed the surface ocean temperature
elsewhere with a simple ocean model. With both
arrangements, the model was able to simulate many
aspects of the low-frequency (periods greater than 6
yr) variations of precipitation over the Great
Plains and in the American Southwest including much
of the nineteenth-century variability, the droughts
of the 1930s (the "Dust Bowl") and 1950s, and the
very wet period in the 1990s. Results indicate that
the persistent droughts and pluvials were ultimately
forced by persistent variations of tropical Pacific
surface ocean temperatures. It is argued that ocean
temperature variations outside of the tropical
Pacific, but forced from the tropical Pacific, act
to strengthen the droughts and pluvials. The
persistent precipitation variations are part of a
pattern of global variations that have a strong
hemispherically and zonally symmetric component,
which is akin to interannual variability, and that
can be explained in terms of interactions between
tropical ocean temperature variations, the
subtropical jets, transient eddies, and the
eddy-driven mean meridional circulation. Rossby wave
propagation poleward and eastward from the tropical
Pacific heating anomalies disrupts the zonal
symmetry, intensifying droughts and pluvials over
North America. Both mechanisms of tropical driving
of extratropical precipitation variations work in
summer as well as winter and can explain the
year-round nature of the precipitation
variations. In addition, land-atmosphere
interactions over North America appear important by
(i) translating winter precipitation variations into
summer evaporation and, hence, precipitation
anomalies and (ii) shifting the northward flow of
moisture around the North Atlantic subtropical
anticyclone eastward from the Plains and Southwest
to the eastern seaboard and western Atlantic Ocean.},

One surprising outcome is that locally weighted partial least squares regression offers the best average results, thus outperforming even factor analysis, the theoretically most appealing of our candidate techniques.},

participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project phase 3 and used for the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report
are analyzed by computing differences between 2046
and 2065 and 1961 and 2000. The contributions to
changes in precipitation minus evaporation, P-E,
caused thermodynamically by changes in specific
humidity, dynamically by changes in circulation, and
by changes in moisture transports by transient
eddies are evaluated. The thermodynamic and dynamic
contributions are further separated into advective
and divergent components. The nonthermodynamic
contributions are then related to changes in the
mean and transient circulation. The projected change
in P-E involves an intensification of the existing
pattern of P-E with wet areas [the intertropical
convergence zone (ITCZ) and mid-to high latitudes]
getting wetter and arid and semiarid regions of the
subtropics getting drier. In addition, the
subtropical dry zones expand poleward. The
accentuation of the twentieth-century pattern of P-E
is in part explained by increases in specific
humidity via both advection and divergence
terms. Weakening of the tropical divergent
circulation partially opposes the thermodynamic
contribution by creating a tendency to decreased P-E
in the ITCZ and to increased P-E in the descending
branches of the Walker and Hadley cells. The
changing mean circulation also causes decreased P 2
E on the poleward flanks of the subtropics because
the descending branch of the Hadley Cell expands and
the midlatitude meridional circulation cell shifts
poleward. Subtropical drying and poleward moistening
are also contributed to by an increase in poleward
moisture transport by transient eddies. The
thermodynamic contribution to changing P-E, arising
from increased specific humidity, is almost entirely
accounted for by atmospheric warming under fixed
relative humidity.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a bias problem in the estimate
of wavelet power spectra for atmospheric and oceanic
datasets. For a time series comprised of sine waves
with the same amplitude at different frequencies the
conventionally adopted wavelet method does not
produce a spectrum with identical peaks, in contrast
to a Fourier analysis. The wavelet power spectrum in
this definition, that is, the transform coefficient
squared (to within a constant factor), is equivalent
to the integration of energy (in physical space)
over the influence period (time scale) the series
spans. Thus, a physically consistent definition of
energy for the wavelet power spectrum should be the
transform coefficient squared divided by the scale
it associates. Such adjusted wavelet power spectrum
results in a substantial improvement in the spectral
estimate, allowing for a comparison of the spectral
peaks across scales. The improvement is validated
with an artificial time series and a real coastal
sea level record. Also examined is the previous
example of the wavelet analysis of the Nino-3 SST

past temperature have been essentially biased to the
extratropics owing to a paucity of proxy data in
tropical regions. Herein we describe the first
coral-based reconstruction of sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) for the whole of the tropics (30
degrees N-30 degrees S). It was developed from 14
disparate coral records located in the Indian and
Pacific oceans. Over the most replicated period, the
reconstruction explains 57{\%} of the tropical SST
variance. However, the strength of this signal
weakens markedly as the number of coral records
decreases. The reconstruction is robust between 1850
and 1993, but some fidelity is indicated back as far
as the mid 18th century. These results suggest that
ambiguities in the low frequency domain of delta
O-18 measurements can be partially overcome by
pooling together multiple time series from different
locations around the tropics. Agreement with
simulations from two general circulation models
indicates that the late 20th century is likely the
warmest period in the tropics for the last 250
years, and that this recent warming can only be
explained by anthropogenic forcing. The high
frequency variability is dominated by the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation. The reconstruction, owing
to the small number of coral records, is
unfortunately restricted both in time and
space. Therefore we hope that this study will spur
the palaeoclimate community to develop new and
longer proxy series to improve the current meager
data-base of temperature sensitive series in the
tropics.},

abstract = {Neural networks are increasingly used in environmental science applications. Furthermore, neural network models are trained by minimizing a loss function, and it is crucial to choose the loss function very carefully for environmental science applications, as it determines what exactly is being optimized. Standard loss functions do not cover all the needs of the environmental sciences, which makes it important for scientists to be able to develop their own custom loss functions so that they can implement many of the classic performance measures already developed in environmental science, including measures developed for spatial model verification. However, there are very few resources available that cover the basics of custom loss function development comprehensively, and to the best of our knowledge none that focus on the needs of environmental scientists. This document seeks to fill this gap by providing a guide on how to write custom loss functions targeted toward environmental science applications. Topics include the basics of writing custom loss functions, common pitfalls, functions to use in loss functions, examples such as fractions skill score as loss function, how to incorporate physical constraints, discrete and soft discretization, and concepts such as focal, robust, and adaptive loss. While examples are currently provided in this guide for Python with Keras and the TensorFlow backend, the basic concepts also apply to other environments, such as Python with PyTorch. Similarly, while the sample loss functions provided here are from meteorology, these are just examples of how to create custom loss functions. Other fields in the environmental sciences have very similar needs for custom loss functions, e.g., for evaluating spatial forecasts effectively, and the concepts discussed here can be applied there as well.

abstract = {F or more than 20 years, detection and attribution techniques have been used to identify human influence on global temperature changes and to quantify the contributions of individual forcings to observed changes 1-3. The commitment of parties to the Paris Agreement 4 to "holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels", and the Global Stocktake process, which aims to monitor progress towards the Paris Agreement goals, give new relevance to efforts to quantify human climate influence so far. While the Paris Agreement is not explicit about the meaning of either 'global average temperature' or 'pre-industrial levels' , much of the climate impacts literature on which assessment of dangerous anthropogenic interference in climate is based has used globally complete global mean near-surface air temperature (GSAT) from climate models to assess future climate impacts. Therefore, we primarily assess human influence on GSAT in this Article. Recent literature has demonstrated that, in climate models, this metric of global mean temperature warms more than blended sea surface temperatures over ocean and near-surface air temperature over land, masked with observational coverage (global mean surface temperature (GMST)) 5-7. Previous attribution studies have typically estimated attributable trends over the past 50-60 years in GMST 8 , but estimates of warming relative to pre-industrial levels are more relevant to monitoring progress towards Paris Agreement goals. While multiple possible periods over the Holocene could be chosen as pre-industrial base periods 9 , we follow the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (ref. 10 ; SR1.5) and choose 1850-1900. Comparison of global mean temperature metrics Annual means of global mean temperature anomalies in the fourth Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit Temperature (HadCRUT4) 11 dataset relative to 1850-1900 and based on an area-weighted global mean of monthly mean anomalies are shown in Fig. 1a. These are compared with global mean blended sea surface temperatures over ocean and near-surface air temperatures over land and ice masked with HadCRUT4 coverage 5 (GMST, Methods) in individual Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) 12 historical simulations merged with Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 (SSP2-4.5) 13 simulations (historical-ssp245 simulations hereafter). The simulated warming in 2010-2019 is on average 17{\%} (5-95{\%} ensemble range of 10{\%}-24{\%}) stronger in globally complete GSAT than in HadCRUT4-masked GMST (Fig. 1a) (similar to previous results based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations 14,15), demonstrating the importance of the choice of metric for assessing attributable warming. Comparing globally complete versions of GSAT and GMST, the simulated warming in GSAT is only 6{\%} stronger (5-95{\%} range of 2-8{\%}). Therefore, the largest contribution to the enhanced warming in globally complete GSAT versus HadCRUT4-masked GMST comes from the observational masking. Multiplying the observed 2010-2019 warming in HadCRUT4 GMST of 0.94 °C (5-95{\%} range of 0.90-0.99 °C, Supplementary Table 1) by the ratio of simulated warming in globally complete GSAT to HadCRUT4-masked GMST (1.17), we infer a best estimate of observed 2010-2019 warming in GSAT of 1.10 °C (5-95{\%} range of 1.01-1.20 °C). Similar calculations using HadCRUT5 Parties to the Paris Agreement agreed to holding global average temperature increases "well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels". Monitoring the contributions of human-induced climate forcings to warming so far is key to understanding progress towards these goals. Here we use climate model simulations from the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project, as well as regularized optimal fingerprinting, to show that anthropogenic forcings caused 0.9 to 1.3 °C of warming in global mean near-surface air temperature in 2010-2019 relative to 1850-1900, compared with an observed warming of 1.1 °C. Greenhouse gases and aerosols contributed changes of 1.2 to 1.9 °C and −0.7 to −0.1 °C, respectively, and natural forcings contributed negligibly. These results demonstrate the substantial human influence on climate so far and the urgency of action needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals.

abstract = {We review the growing evidence for a widespread inconsistency between the low strength of predictable signals in climate models and the relatively high level of agreement they exhibit with observed variability of the atmospheric circulation. This discrepancy is particularly evident in the climate variability of the Atlantic sector, where ensemble predictions using climate models generally show higher correlation with observed variability than with their own simulations, and higher correlations with observations than would be expected from their small signal-to-noise ratios, hence a ‘signal-to-noise paradox'. This unusual behaviour has been documented in multiple climate prediction systems and in the response to a number of different sources of climate variability. However, we also note that the total variance in the models is often close in magnitude to the observed variance, and so it is not a simple matter of models containing too much variability. Instead, the proportion of Atlantic climate variance that is predictable in climate models appears to be too weak in amplitude by a factor of two, or perhaps more. In this review, we provide a range of examples from existing studies to build the case for a problem that is common across different climate models, common to several different sources of climate variability and common across a range of timescales. We also discuss the wider implications of this intriguing paradox.},

abstract = {Understanding and estimating regional climate change under different anthropogenic emission scenarios is pivotal for informing societal adaptation and mitigation measures. However, the high computational complexity of state-of-the-art climate models remains a central bottleneck in this endeavour. Here we introduce a machine learning approach, which utilises a unique dataset of existing climate model simulations to learn relationships between short-term and long-term temperature responses to different climate forcing scenarios. This approach not only has the potential to accelerate climate change projections by reducing the costs of scenario computations, but also helps uncover early indicators of modelled long-term climate responses, which is of relevance to climate change detection, predictability, and attribution. Our results highlight challenges and opportunities for data-driven climate modelling, especially concerning the incorporation of even larger model datasets in the future. We therefore encourage extensive data sharing among research institutes to build ever more powerful climate response emulators, and thus to enable faster climate change projections. npj Climate and Atmospheric Science (2020) 3:44 ; https://doi.},

abstract = {In recent years the global warming trend has plateaued, despite increasing anthropogenic emissions. Now research attributes this plateau to an increase in ocean heat uptake, through retrospective predictions of up to 5 years in length. The ability to hindcast this warming plateau strengthens our confidence in the robustness of climate models. Despite a sustained production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, the Earth's mean near-surface temperature paused its rise during the 2000–2010 period1. To explain such a pause, an increase in ocean heat uptake below the superficial ocean layer2,3 has been proposed to overcompensate for the Earth's heat storage. Contributions have also been suggested from the deep prolonged solar minimum4, the stratospheric water vapour5, the stratospheric6 and tropospheric aerosols7. However, a robust attribution of this warming slowdown has not been achievable up to now. Here we show successful retrospective predictions of this warming slowdown up to 5 years ahead, the analysis of which allows us to attribute the onset of this slowdown to an increase in ocean heat uptake. Sensitivity experiments accounting only for the external radiative forcings do not reproduce the slowdown. The top-of-atmosphere net energy input remained in the [0.5–1] W m−2 interval during the past decade, which is successfully captured by our predictions. Most of this excess energy was absorbed in the top 700 m of the ocean at the onset of the warming pause, 65{\%} of it in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Our results hence point at the key role of the ocean heat uptake in the recent warming slowdown. The ability to predict retrospectively this slowdown not only strengthens our confidence in the robustness of our climate models, but also enhances the socio-economic relevance of operational decadal climate predictions.},

amplitude of ENSO variability affects the occurrence

changes in ENSO amplitude is limited by the fact
that the instrumental record is too short to

resolved record of ENSO variability over the past

independent, ENSO-sensitive proxy records in the
Pacific and surrounding regions. Together, these
records indicate that ENSO amplitude exhibits a
quasi-regular cycle of 50-90 years that is closely
coupled to the tropical Pacific mean
state. Anomalously warm conditions in the eastern
Pacific are associated with enhanced ENSO

The long-term mean water property and circulation patterns are described, and the local signature of the large-scale 1976–1977 North Pacific climate regime shift is characterized. Changes associated with the climate shift include (1) significant warming in the upper 200–400m of the water column, a decrease in salinity in near-surface coastal waters, and an increase in salinity in subsurface offshore waters; (2) deeper density surfaces and increased stratification throughout the region, particularly within the Southern California Bight; (3) a subtle reorganization of the geostrophic flow structure, including an offshore shift of the California Current and increased nearshore poleward flow; and (4) a cross-shore dichotomy, with the nearshore regime changes occurring primarily during the upwelling season and the offshore variability being of lower frequency than nearer the coast. Changes in the vertical structure of the water column are of particular significance, as they have likely rendered upwelling less biologically effective. This is evident in the temperature and salinity changes, which were greatest (warming and freshening) just above the peak stability changes. There is evidence to suggest that another North Pacific-wide regime shift occurred following the 1997–1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o event, and large ecosystem changes are anticipated. The CalCOFI record is ideally suited for revealing the mechanisms of interdecadal physical–biological interactions in the coastal ocean.},

model ensembles produce consistent precipitation
projections over much of northern tropical Africa. A
moisture budget analysis is used to identify the
circulation changes that support future
precipitation anomalies. The projected midsummer
drought over the Guinean Coast region is related
partly to weakened monsoon flow. Since the rainfall
maximum demonstrates a southward bias in the control
simulation in July-August, this may be indicative of
future summer drying over the Sahel. Wetter
conditions in late summer over the Sahel are
associated with enhanced moisture transport by the
West African westerly jet, a strengthening of the
jet itself, and moisture transport from the
Mediterranean. Severe drought in East Africa during
August and September is accompanied by a weakened
Indian monsoon and Somali jet. Simulations with
projected and idealized SST forcing suggest that
overall SST warming in part supports this regional
model ensemble agreement, although changes in SST
gradients are important over West Africa in spring

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}![CDATA[Abstract. Most Earth system models (ESMs) are running under different high-performance computing (HPC) environments. This has several advantages, from allowing different groups to work with the same tool in parallel to leveraging the burden of ensemble climate simulations, but it also offers alternative solutions in the case of shutdown (expected or not) of any of the environments. However, for obvious scientific reasons, it is critical to ensure that ESMs provide identical results under changes in computing environment. While strict bit-for-bit reproducibility is not always guaranteed with ESMs, it is desirable that results obtained under one computing environment are at least statistically indistinguishable from those obtained under another environment, which we term a “replicability” condition following the metrology nomenclature. Here, we develop a protocol to assess the replicability of the EC-Earth ESM. Using two versions of EC-Earth, we present one case of non-replicability and one case of replicability. The non-replicable case occurs with the older version of the model and likely finds its origin in the treatment of river runoff along Antarctic coasts. By contrast, the more recent version of the model provides replicable results. The methodology presented here has been adopted as a standard test by the EC-Earth consortium (27 institutions in Europe) to evaluate the replicability of any new model version across platforms, including for CMIP6 experiments. To a larger extent, it can be used to assess whether other ESMs can safely be ported from one HPC environment to another for studying climate-related questions. Our results and experience with this work suggest that the default assumption should be that ESMs are not replicable under changes in the HPC environment, until proven otherwise.]]{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This paper is devoted to illustrating new wavelet
analysis methods in the field of hydrology. New
wavelet indicators are applied to long-term
hydrological and climatologic proxies. They are
first applied to four Atlantic large river monthly
discharges (Amazon, Parana, Orinoco and Congo) and
then applied to two well-known long-term
climatologic indexes: the Southern Oscillation and
the North Atlantic Oscillation. This approach makes
it possible to suggest physical explanations for
time-scale dependant relationships. Six-month
variability is present in all the rivers except in
the Parana. In the Congo River this signal is near
stationary with strong entropy. The strength of this
scale coincides with higher discharge variability
before 1920 and over the Orinoco basin with higher
discharge values between 1940 and 1955. An annual
cycle is present in all the rivers but is much
stronger, along with the entropy, in the rivers with
a large tropical basin, as in the Amazon and the
Orinoco. This annual signal is not permanent in the
Congo and much more intermittent in the Parana where
the annual recharge appears as very irregular. A
quasi biennial variability is apparent in all the
equator ward rivers and a nearly permanent 2-year
coherence is found between Sol and the Amazon
discharge. A 3-6year oscillation typical of ENSO
variability is observed in all the rivers. It is
intermittent, observed before 1930 in all the rivers
and after 1980 mostly in the Amazon River. These
peaks of activity correspond to periods of major Sol
variability. An 8-year variability is particularly
strong in the Parana River before 1940 and around
1970 and to a lesser extent in the Orinoco River
during the low NAO index period, between 1940 and
1970. The Congo River exhibits that time-scale
around 1970. A 13-year variability common to Sol,
NAO and the South Atlantic Ocean circulation is
observed in the Parana and Congo discharges. In all
the rivers the greatest entropy is observed at bi
and multi decadal time scales with the greatest
coherence with both NAO and Sol. A near 20-year
time-scale is observed in most of the series around
1970, although it is strongest in Amazon and Parana
discharges. Finally, a 30-year time-scale is

abstract = {Black box machine learning models are currently being used for high-stakes decision making throughout society, causing problems in healthcare, criminal justice and other domains. Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision. There has been a recent rise of interest in developing methods for ‘explainable AI', where models are created to explain how a first ‘black box' machine learning model arrives at a specific decision. It can be argued that instead efforts should be directed at building inherently interpretable models in the first place, in particular where they are applied in applications that directly affect human lives, such as in healthcare and criminal justice.},

We apply the model to six crops in the United States, and show that it outperforms traditional empirical models under cross-validation. The fitted model parameters provide evidence of considerable existing climate adaptation across counties. If crop locations are held constant in the future, total agriculture profits for the six crops will drop by 31{\%} for the temperature patterns of 2070 under RCP 8.5. When crop lands are reallocated to avoid yield decreases and take advantage of yield increases, half of these losses are avoided (16{\%} loss), but 57{\%} of counties are allocated crops different from those currently planted. Our results provide a framework for identifying crop adaptation opportunities, but suggest limits to their potential.},

abstract = {A stochastic model of climate variability is considered in which slow changes of climate are explained as the integral response to continuous random excitation by short period “weather” disturbances. The coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land system is divided into a rapidly varying “weather” system (essentially the atmosphere) and a slowly responding “climate” system (the ocean, cryosphere, land vegetation, etc.). In the usual Statistical Dynamical Model (SDM) only the average transport effects of the rapidly varying weather components are parameterised in the climate system. The resultant prognostic equations are deterministic, and climate variability can normally arise only through variable external conditions. The essential feature of stochastic climate models is that the non-averaged “weather” components are also retained. They appear formally as random forcing terms. The climate system, acting as an integrator of this short-period excitation, exhibits the same random-walk response characteristics as large particles interacting with an ensemble of much smaller particles in the analogous Brownian motion problem. The model predicts “red” variance spectra, in qualitative agreement with observations. The evolution of the climate probability distribution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the effect of the random weather excitation is represented by diffusion terms. Without stabilising feedback, the model predicts a continuous increase in climate variability, in analogy with the continuous, unbounded dispersion of particles in Brownian motion (or in a homogeneous turbulent fluid). Stabilising feedback yields a statistically stationary climate probability distribution. Feedback also results in a finite degree of climate predictability, but for a stationary climate the predictability is limited to maximal skill parameters of order 0.5.

abstract = {The intention of this research was to explore whether dendroclimatological relationships could be used to reconstruct long-term proxy records of Little Ice Age' glacier mass balance changes in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia. Tree-ring width chronologies from the Mt Waddington area were used in concert with historical glacier records to construct models spanning the past 450 years. The approach was to build models that were based on derived relationships between tree-ring growth and glacier mass balance: (1) warmer temperatures in the summer positively influence tree growth but are detrimental to glacier health; (2) colder temperatures during the winter and deeper snowpack have a negative impact on tree growth, whereas they are related to greater accumulation on the glacier during the winter season. Stepwise regression analyses were applied to tree-ring chronologies to predict glacier mass balance at local and regional scales. The models of net annual balance for the region (regional data set) show that periods of positive mass balance occurred in the AD 1750s, 1820s to 1830s and 1970s. Peaks of winter balance correspond closely to these periods, showing a sharp drop in winter mass balance towards the end of the nineteenth century. Wavelet analyses suggest that glacial mass balance regimes in the region respond synchronously to Pacific Ocean circulation systems such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.},

the United States during the 20th century, with the
largest increases observed in the fall. In this
study, we apply the multitaper method with singular
value decomposition (MTM-SVD) multivariate spectral
analysis to characterize the space-time variability
of fall precipitation over the United States from
1895 to 2004. MTM-SVD analysis of precipitation
demonstrates the presence of statistically
significant secular and decadal signals. The decadal
signal in fall precipitation, with a period of
approximately 12 years, is large and spatially
correlated across most of the central United
States. The secular signal, with a period greater
than 55 years, is weaker, much less spatially
correlated and is strongest in the eastern United
States. The decadal and secular variations increased
in magnitude after 1950, the period when many
previous studies have identified large linear
trends. Linear trends in fall precipitation are
found to be more spatially consistent with the
pattern of decadal variations than the secular
variations, suggesting that increasing decadal
variations in precipitation after 1950 have
contributed to large linear trends reported by
several previous studies. Our results suggest that
the strong spatial correlation in decadal
precipitation variations across the central United
States are associated with a large SLP gradient
across North America that is conducive for southerly
flow from the Gulf of Mexico. Secular variations in
SLP associated with precipitation over the United
States are located primarily in the high latitudes,
and are not consistent with correlated variations in
precipitation across the central United States.},

increasing demand and limited supply, and possibly
exacerbated by climate change. Two applications of
dendrochronology to the study of flow variability

reconstruction of annual flows of the Colorado River
at Lees Ferry, Arizona, USA: (1) identification and
climatological interpretation of rare flow events,
and (2) assessment of vulnerability of water-supply
systems to climatic variability. Analysis centers on
a sustained drought of the mid-1100s characterized
by persistent low flows on both the Colorado and
Sacramento Rivers. Analysis of geopotential height
anomalies during modern joint-droughts suggests more
than one mode of circulation might accompany
joint-drought in the two basins. Monte Carlo
simulation is used to demonstrate that a drought as
severe as that in the 1100s on the Colorado River
might be expected about once in every 4-6 centuries
by chance alone given the time-series properties of
the modern gaged flows. Application of a
river-management model suggests a mid-1100s-style
drought, were it to occur today, would drop
reservoir levels in Lake Mead to dead-pool within a
few decades. Uncertainty presents challenges to
accurately quantifying severe sustained droughts
from streamflow reconstructions, especially early in
the tree-ring record. Corroboration by multiple
proxy records is essential. Future improvements are
likely to require a combination of methodological
advancements and expanded basic data. (C) 2010

abstract = {[1] Three prominent quasi-global patterns of
variability and change are observed using the Met
Office's sea surface temperature (SST) analysis and
almost independent night marine air temperature
analysis. The first is a global warming signal that
is very highly correlated with global mean SST. The
second is a decadal to multidecadal fluctuation with
some geographical similarity to the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO). It is associated with the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and its
Pacific-wide manifestation has been termed the
Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). We present
model investigations of the relationship between the
IPO and ENSO. The third mode is an interhemispheric
variation on multidecadal timescales which, in view
of climate model experiments, is likely to be at
least partly due to natural variations in the
thermohaline circulation. Observed climatic impacts
of this mode also appear in model
simulations. Smaller-scale, regional atmospheric
phenomena also affect climate on decadal to
interdecadal timescales. We concentrate on one such
mode, the winter North Atlantic Oscillation
(NAO). This shows strong decadal to interdecadal
variability and a correspondingly strong influence
on surface climate variability which is largely
additional to the effects of recent regional
anthropogenic climate change. The winter NAO is
likely influenced by both SST forcing and
stratospheric variability. A full understanding of
decadal changes in the NAO and European winter
climate may require a detailed representation of the
stratosphere that is hitherto missing in the major
climate models used to study climate change.},

abstract = {Accounting for natural decadal variability allows better prediction of short-term trends. This study looks at the ability of individual models, which are in phase with the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, to simulate the current global warming slowdown. The authors highlight that the current trend could have been predicted in the 1990s with this technique and the need for consistent hindcast skills to allow reliable decadal predictions. The slowdown in the rate of global warming in the early 2000s is not evident in the multi-model ensemble average of traditional climate change projection simulations1. However, a number of individual ensemble members from that set of models successfully simulate the early-2000s hiatus when naturally-occurring climate variability involving the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) coincided, by chance, with the observed negative phase of the IPO that contributed to the early-2000s hiatus. If the recent methodology of initialized decadal climate prediction could have been applied in the mid-1990s using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 multi-models, both the negative phase of the IPO in the early 2000s as well as the hiatus could have been simulated, with the multi-model average performing better than most of the individual models. The loss of predictive skill for six initial years before the mid-1990s points to the need for consistent hindcast skill to establish reliability of an operational decadal climate prediction system.},

abstract = {An analysis of the spring-summer 1988 drought: and
1993 floods over North America reveals a reversal in
the sign of anomalies in several fields. Large sea
surface temperature anomalies of opposite signs
existed in the tropical Pacific with strong La Nina
conditions in 1988 and a mature EI Nino in 1993. The
distribution of tropical convection in the
convergence zones and associated latent healing of
the atmosphere were correspondingly altered,
implying a large scale switch in the anomalous
tropical heating and forcing of extratropical quasi
stationary waves in the atmosphere, influencing the
subtropical jet stream over the North Pacific and
across North America. In 1988 the jet stream and the
closely related storm track of high-frequency
disturbances in the upper troposphere were displaced
into Canada well north of the normal location-the
farthest north of any year from 1979 to 1993. in
1993 a broader jet stream and the storm track were
displaced well south of normal to a more springlike
location across the United States the farthest south
by over 200 km of any year from 1979 to
1993. High-frequency eddy activity in the
Pacific-North American storm track is shown to
reinforce the anomalous jet streams in both
years. An analysis of the moisture budgets reveals a
stronger river of atmospheric moisture flowing
across the Gulf of Mexico into the central and
eastern United States Ln 1993. Also, in the lower
atmosphere, the storm track in 1993 was mon active,
and its lower latitude allowed the cyclonic
disturbances to tap into the moisture source,
transport moisture into the upper Mississippi River
basin, and precipitate it out. It is deduced that
local evaporation may have enhanced the
precipitation and helped perpetuate and prolong the
conditions. In contrast, in 1988 disturbances were
weaker and displaced far enough north to avoid most
of the moisture source, and the drought was
perpetuated by the dry conditions. Consequently,
these effects should be viewed as feedbacks that
amplify and prolong the response, while from the
standpoint of the atmosphere, the anomalous tropical
Pacific sea surface temperatures are a notable (but
not the sole) external forcing of the patterns .},

A normalization estimates direct economic losses from a historical extreme event if that same event was to occur under contemporary societal conditions. Under the global indicator framework of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the reduction of direct economic losses as a proportion of total economic activity is identified as a key indicator of progress in the mitigation of disaster impacts. Understanding loss trends in the context of development can therefore aid in assessing sustainable development. This analysis provides a major update to the leading dataset on normalized US hurricane losses in the continental United States from 1900 to 2017. Over this period, 197 hurricanes resulted in 206 landfalls with about US{\$}2 trillion in normalized (2018) damage, or just under US{\$}17 billion annually. Consistent with observed trends in the frequency and intensity of hurricane landfalls along the continental United States since 1900, the updated normalized loss estimates also show no trend. A more detailed comparison of trends in hurricanes and normalized losses over various periods in the twentieth century to 2017 demonstrates a very high degree of consistency.},

The magnitude of the downwelling longwave radiation during the event was unprecedented compared to all other events detected by AIRS in December/January since 2003. An approximate budget scaling suggests that this anomalous SEB could have resulted in up to 10 cm of ice melt. Thinning of the ice pack in the region was supported by remotely sensed and modeled estimates of ice thickness change. Understanding the impact of this anomalous air mass on a thinner, weakened sea ice state is imperative for understanding future sea ice-atmosphere interactions in a warming Arctic.},

abstract = {To explore the vertical coherence of the vertical
temperature structure in the atmosphere, an analysis
is performed of the full three-dimensional spatial
structure of the temperature field monthly mean
anomalies from the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40)
for a core region of the Tropics from 30 degrees N
to 30 degrees S, with results projected
globally. The focus is on the first three empirical
orthogonal functions (EOFs), two of which have
primary relationships to El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and feature rather different
vertical structures. The second (EOF-2) also has a
weak ENSO signature but a very complex vertical
structure and reflects mainly nonlinear trends, some
real but also some in large part spurious and
associated with problems in assimilating satellite
data. The dominant pattern (EOF-1) in its positive
sign features highly coherent zonal mean warming
throughout the tropical troposphere from 30 degrees
N to 30 degrees S that increases in magnitude with
height to 300 hPa, drops to zero about 100 hPa at
the tropopause, and has reverse sign to 30 hPa with
peak negative values at 70 hPa. Spatially at low
levels it shows warmth throughout most of the
Tropics although with weak or slightly opposite sign
in the western tropical Pacific and a strong
reversed sign in the Pacific subtropics. Coherent
wave structures below 700 hPa at higher latitudes
cancel out in the zonal mean. However, the structure
becomes more zonal above about 700 hPa and features
off-equatorial maxima straddling the equator in the
eastern Pacific in the upper troposphere with
opposite sign at 100 hPa, as a signature of a forced
Rossby wave. The corresponding sea level pressure
pattern is similar to but more focused in equatorial
regions than the Southern Oscillation pattern. The
time series highlights the 1997/98 El Nino along
with those in 1982/83 and 1986/87, and the 1988/89
La Nina, and correlates strongly with global mean
surface temperatures. Missing, however, is the
prolonged sequence of three successive El Nino
events in the early 1990s, which are highlighted in
EOF-3 as part of a mainly lower-frequency decadal
variation that features modest zonal mean warming
below 700 hPa, cooling from 700 to 300 hPa, and
warming above 300 hPa, peaking at 100 hPa and
extending from 40 degrees N to 50 degrees
S. Spatially at the surface this pattern is
dominated by Southern Oscillation wave-1 structures
throughout the Tropics and especially the
subtropics. The regional temperature structures are
coherent throughout the troposphere, with strongest
values in the Pacific and extending well into the
extratropics, with a sign reversal at and above 100
hPa. Strong Rossby wave signatures are featured in
the troposphere with a distinctive quadrupole
pattern that reverses at 100 hPa. The vertical
coherence of all patterns suggests that they should
be apparent in broad-layer satellite temperature
records but that stratospheric anomalies are not
independent. The quite different three-dimensional
structure of these different patterns highlights the
need to consider the full structure outside of the
Pacific and at all vertical levels in accounting for
impacts of ENSO, and how they relate to the global
mean.},

Using a collection of coordinated atmospheric and coupled global climate model perturbation experiments, we find an emergent relationship between the high‐latitude 1000‐500 hPa thickness response and an enhancement of the Siberian High in winter. This wave‐number‐1‐like sea level pressure anomaly pattern is linked to an equatorward shift of the eddy‐driven jet and a dynamical cooling response in eastern Asia. Additional simulations, where AA is imposed directly into the model domain by nudging, demonstrate how the sea ice forcing is insufficient by itself to capture the vertical extent of the warming and by extension the amplitude of the response in the Siberian high. This study demonstrates the importance of the vertical extent of the tropospheric warming over the polar cap in revealing the "warm Arctic, cold Siberia" anomaly pattern in future projections.},

resolution from a topographically closed (but
hydrologically open) lake basin was used to
reconstruct changes in lake salinity and evaporative
intensity and to evaluate the reliability of
different proxies for inferring climatic change in
the glaciated Northern Great Plains (NGP). At Rice
Lake, North Dakota, the ostracode-Mg/Ca ratios show
good correlation with other ostracode, diatom and
aeolian proxy records from other sites in the
NGP. All of these records show significant
century-scale periodicities, which have been related
to solar variability as inferred from atmospheric
radiocarbon records. This coherent and consistent
pattern suggests that these sites record climatic
variability at regional scales. The interval of the
Mediaeval Climatic Anomaly from similar to900 to 550
cal. yr BP contains two pronounced dry
periods. During the following 'Little Ice Age', a
single period of frequent drought that peaked at
similar to300 cal. yr BP was bracketed by wet
periods before and after. In contrast, the
ostracode-Sr/Ca ratios and ostracode- and
mollusc-records from Rice Lake have different
patterns and do not correlate well with each other
or with the same proxies at other sites. This lack
of consistent pattern within a site and among
several regional sites suggests seasonal and/or
site-specific influences on these proxies. Variable
contributions of groundwater, with low delta(18)O
values because of selective recharge from snowmelt,
may have played an important role in determining the
isotopic composition of the lake. The poor
correlation of Sr/Ca with other proxies is caused by
mediation of inorganic carbonate mineralogy, owing
to active uptake of Sr in the formation of inorganic
aragonite. Thus, our sediment data along with
present-day lakewater chemistry suggest that
carbonate-delta(18)O records in the NGP cannot be
interpreted simply in terms of climate because of
significant local groundwater
influences. Ostracode-Mg/Ca ratios tend to be a
better indicator of past salinity because of the
conservative nature of Mg in oligosaline waters

abstract = {Separating how model-to-model differences in the forced response (U MD) and internal variability (U IV) contribute to the uncertainty in climate projections is important, but challenging. Reducing U MD increases confidence in projections, while U IV characterises the range of possible futures that might occur purely by chance. Separating these uncertainties is limited in traditional multi-model ensembles because most models have only a small number of realisations; furthermore, some models are not independent. Here, we use six largely independent single model initial-condition large ensembles to separate the contributions of U MD and U IV in projecting 21st-century changes of temperature, precipitation, and their temporal variability under strong forcing (RCP8.5). We provide a method that produces similar results using traditional multi-model archives. While U MD is larger than U IV for both temperature and precipitation changes, U IV is larger than U MD for the changes in temporal variability of both temperature and precipitation, between 20° and 80° latitude in both hemispheres. Over large regions and for all variables considered here except temporal temperature variability, models agree on the sign of the forced response whereas they disagree widely on the magnitude. Our separation method can readily be extended to other climate variables.},

abstract = {Independent verification of anthropogenic influence on specific extreme climate events remains elusive. This study presents a framework for such verification. This framework reveals that previously published results based on a 1961–2005 attribution period frequently underestimate the influence of global warming on the probability of unprecedented extremes during the 2006–2017 period. This underestimation is particularly pronounced for hot and wet events, with greater uncertainty for dry events. The underestimation is reflected in discrepancies between probabilities predicted during the attribution period and frequencies observed during the out-of-sample verification period. These discrepancies are most explained by increases in climate forcing between the attribution and verification periods, suggesting that 21st-century global warming has substantially increased the probability of unprecedented hot and wet events. Hence, the use of temporally lagged periods for attribution—and, more broadly, for extreme event probability quantification—can cause underestimation of historical impacts, and current and future risks.},

abstract = {Bringing together leaf trait data spanning 2,548 species and 175 sites we describe, for the first time at global scale, a universal spectrum of leaf economics consisting of key chemical, structural and physiological properties. The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

investigate the relative magnitude of decadal to
multidecadal (D2M) variability in annual and
seasonal precipitation anomalies across North
America. In most places, decadal (10-20 yr) or
multidecadal (20-50 yr) variability makes up less
than 10{\%} of the total variance in either annual or
seasonal precipitation, with interannual variability
or secular trends having much greater
importance. Decadal variability is most prominent
(contributing 25{\%}-30{\%} of the total variance) in
Minnesota and northern California during winter, and
the central Rocky Mountains in autumn. Eastern
Quebec is the only major region where precipitation
exhibits significant variance in the multidecadal
band. Precipitation across much of Canada exhibits
significant variance at extremely low frequencies
(greater than 50 yr), but variability at these time
scales cannot be separated from secular trends
because of the limited length of instrumental
climate records. Decadal signals in the discharge of
the Sacramento River and, to a lesser degree, the
Colorado River are coherent and in phase with
similar signals in regional precipitation.
Prominent D2M signals do not resemble the
low-frequency components of major climate modes such
as ENSO or the PDO, which suggests that this
behavior is not a product of a simple linear
translation of a single climate forcing.},

abstract = {The Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) features a basin-scale horseshoe-like sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly pattern. Its cold-phase shift around 1999, implicated as a driver for the early-2000s global warming slowdown, has been potentially linked to the Atlantic warming during the positive-phase Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV). However, the key mechanism for the trans-basin Atlantic-Pacific teleconnection remains debatable. Here, we show that an AMV-SST cooling can initiate a pan-Pacific response. The North Atlantic cooling induces westerly wind anomalies over the central-western equatorial Pacific as Kelvin-wave responses and easterly wind anomalies over the far-eastern equatorial Pacific as Rossby-wave responses. Additionally, anomalous lows are generated over the extratropical North and South Pacific through the midlatitude Rossby wave propagation. The tropical and midlatitude teleconnections act together to develop into a warm-phase IPO-like pattern through the wind-induced latent heat. Our results suggest a potential of advancing the predictability of IPO through a skillful simulation of AMV.},

abstract = {Though most hurricane evacuation studies have focused on residents, tourists are also a vulnerable population. To assess their perceptions of risk and evacuation likelihood under different hurricane conditions, we surveyed 448 tourists visiting central Florida. Respondents viewed four maps emulating track forecast cones produced by the National Hurricane Center and text information featuring variations of storm intensity, coast of landfall, centerline position relative to the survey site, time until landfall, and event duration. We performed chi-square tests to determine which hurricane conditions, and aspects of tourists such as their demographics and previous hurricane experience, most likely influenced their ratings of risk and evacuation likelihood for respondents located on Pinellas County beaches or inland near Orlando, FL. Highly rated scenarios featured a Category 4 hurricane making landfall along the Gulf Coast with the centerline passing over the sampling site. Overall, tourists that indicated the highest risk and evacuation ratings were not previously affected by a hurricane, had a trip duration of less than 6 days, and had checked for the possibility of a hurricane strike before departure. However, results for other tourist attributes differed between tourists in coastal and inland locations. We found that although somewhat knowledgeable about hurricanes, tourists misinterpreted the track forecast cone and hurricane conditions, which led to a lower perception of risk and subsequent likelihood to evacuate. Tourists, particularly those from outside of Florida, need to be better educated about the risks they face from hurricanes that make landfall.},

abstract = {Climatic variability is a dominant factor affecting
large wildfires in the western United States, an
observation supported by palaeoecological data on
charcoal in lake sediments and reconstructions from
fire-scarred trees. Although current fire management
focuses on fuel reductions to bring fuel loadings
back to their historical ranges, at the regional
scale extreme fire weather is still the dominant
influence on area burned and fire severity. Current
forecasting tools are limited to short-term
predictions of fire weather but increased
understanding of large-scale oceanic and atmospheric
patterns in the Pacific Ocean (e.g., El Nino
Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation)
may improve our ability to predict climatic
variability at seasonal to annual
leads. Associations between these quasi-periodic
patterns and fire occurrence, though evident in some
regions, have been difficult to establish in
others. Increased temperature in the future will
likely extend fire seasons throughout the western
United States, with more fires occurring earlier and
later than is currently typical, and will increase
the total area burned in some regions. If climatic
change increases the amplitude and duration of
extreme fire weather we can expect significant
changes in the distribution and abundance of
dominant plant species in some ecosystems, which
would thus affect habitat of some sensitive plant
and animal species. Some species that are sensitive
to fire may decline, whereas the distribution and
abundance of species favored by fire may be
enhanced. The effects of climatic change will
partially depend on the extent to which resource
management modifies vegetation structure and fuels.},

Ocean carbon-cycle models used in calculating these scenarios assume that oceanic circulation and biology remain unchanged through time. Here we examine the importance of this assumption by using a coupled atmosphere–ocean model of global warming5 for the period 1765 to 2065. We find a large potential modification to the ocean carbon sink in a vast region of the Southern Ocean where increased rainfall leads to surface freshening and increased stratification6. The increased stratification reduces the downward flux of carbon and the loss of heat to the atmosphere, both of which decrease the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 relative to a constant-climate control scenario. Changes in the formation, transport and cycling of biological material may counteract the reduced uptake, but the response of the biological community to the climate change is difficult to predict on present understanding. Our simulation suggests that such physical and biological changes might already be occurring, and that they could substantially affect the ocean carbon sink over the next few decades.},

abstract = {Tropospheric aerosol radiative forcing has persisted for many years as one of the major causes of uncertainty in global climate model simulations. To sample the range of plausible aerosol and atmospheric states and perform robust statistical analyses of the radiative forcing, it is important to account for the combined effects of many sources of model uncertainty, which is rarely done due to the high computational cost. This paper describes the designs of two ensembles of the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environment Model-U.K. Chemistry and Aerosol global climate model and provides the first analyses of the uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing and their causes. The first ensemble was designed to comprehensively sample uncertainty in the aerosol state, while the other samples additional uncertainties in the physical model related to clouds, humidity, and radiation, thereby allowing an analysis of uncertainty in the aerosol effective radiative forcing. Each ensemble consists of around 200 simulations of the preindustrial and present-day atmospheres. The uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing in our ensembles is comparable to the range of estimates from multimodel intercomparison projects. The mean aerosol effective radiative forcing is −1.45 W/m2 (credible interval of −2.07 to −0.81 W/m2), which encompasses but is more negative than the −1.17 W/m2 in the 2013 Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project and −0.90 W/m2 in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. The ensembles can be used to reduce aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty by challenging them with multiple measurements as well as to isolate potential causes of multimodel differences.},

The reanalyses are evaluated using observations fromtheNorwegian Young Sea Ice campaign (N-ICE2015), a 5-month ice drift in pack ice north of Svalbard. N-ICE2015 observations include surface meteorology, vertical profiles from radiosondes, as well as radiative and turbulent heat fluxes. The reanalyses simulate surface analysis variables well throughout the campaign, but have difficulties with most forecast variables. Wintertime (January-March) correlation coefficients between the reanalyses and observations are above 0.90 for the surface pressure, 2-m temperature, total column water vapor, and downward longwave flux. However, all reanalyses have a positivewintertime 2-m temperature bias, ranging from 1° to 4°C, and negative (i.e., upward) net longwave bias of 3-19Wm-2. These biases are associated with poorly represented surface inversions and are largest during cold-stable periods. Notably, the recent ERA5 and ASRv2 datasets have some of the largest temperature and net longwave biases, respectively. During spring (April-May), reanalyses fail to simulate observed persistent cloud layers. Therefore they overestimate the net shortwave flux (5-79Wm-2) and underestimate the net longwave flux (8-38Wm-2). Promisingly, ERA5 provides the best estimates of downward radiative fluxes in spring and summer, suggesting improved forecasting of Arctic cloud cover. All reanalyses exhibit large negative (upward) residual heat flux biases during winter, and positive (downward) biases during summer. Turbulent heat fluxes over sea ice are simulated poorly in all seasons.},

modeling situations in general, and the
Retrospective North American Land Data Assimilation

examined results from Control, Wet, and Dry 11
year-long Mosaic simulations, while the second phase
attempted to explain spin-up behavior in NLDAS
Retrospective simulations from the Mosaic, Noah, VIC
and Sacramento LSMs based in part on the results
from phase 1. Total column and root zone soil
moisture spin up slowly, while evaporation and deep
soil temperature spin up more quickly. Mosaic soil
moisture initialization with NCEP/DOE Global
Reanalysis 2 (NCEP/DOE R-2) data (Control run) leads
to a faster spin-up time than saturated (Wet run) or
dry (Dry run) initialization, with the Control run
reaching equilibrium 1 to 2 years sooner than the
Wet run and 3 to 4 years more quickly than the Dry
run. Overall, practical drift of land surface stores
and output ceased in the Control run within
approximately 1 year, and fine-scale equilibrium was
reached within 5.5 years. Spin-up times exhibited
large spatial variability, and although no single
causal factor could be determined, they were
correlated most strongly with precipitation and
temperature forcing. In general, NLDAS models reach
a state of rough equilibrium within the first 1 to 2
years of the 3-year Retrospective simulation. The
Sacramento LSM has the shortest spin-up phase,
followed by the Mosaic, VIC, and Noah LSMs. Initial
NCEP/DOE R-2 conditions were too dry in general for
the VIC and Noah LSMs, and too moist for the Mosaic

most cases, the 1-year spin-up time used in the
Retrospective NLDAS simulations eliminated spin-up
problems from the subsequent period that was used
for analysis.},

abstract = {We present a significantly improved data-driven global weather forecasting framework using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to forecast several basic atmospheric variables on a global grid. New developments in this framework include an off-line volume-conservative mapping to a cubed-sphere grid, improvements to the CNN architecture and the minimization of the loss function over multiple steps in a prediction sequence. The cubed-sphere remapping minimizes the distortion on the cube faces on which convolution operations are performed and provides natural boundary conditions for padding in the CNN. Our improved model produces weather forecasts that are indefinitely stable and produce realistic weather patterns at lead times of several weeks and longer. For short- to medium-range forecasting, our model significantly outperforms persistence, climatology, and a coarse-resolution dynamical numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Unsurprisingly, our forecasts are worse than those from a high-resolution state-of-the-art operational NWP system. Our data-driven model is able to learn to forecast complex surface temperature patterns from few input atmospheric state variables. On annual time scales, our model produces a realistic seasonal cycle driven solely by the prescribed variation in top-of-atmosphere solar forcing. Although it currently does not compete with operational weather forecasting models, our data-driven CNN executes much faster than those models, suggesting that machine learning could prove to be a valuable tool for large-ensemble forecasting.},

@article{Chen2021,
abstract = {This study examines historical simulations of ENSO in the E3SM-1-0, CESM2, and GFDL-CM4 climate models, provided by three leading U.S. modeling centers as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). These new models have made substantial progress in simulating ENSO's key features, including: amplitude; timescale; spatial patterns; phase-locking; spring persistence barrier; and recharge oscillator dynamics. However, some important features of ENSO are still a challenge to simulate. In the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, the models' weaker-than-observed subsurface zonal current anomalies and zonal temperature gradient anomalies serve to weaken the nonlinear zonal advection of subsurface temperatures, leading to insufficient warm/cold asymmetry of ENSO's sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA). In the western equatorial Pacific, the models' excessive simulated zonal SST gradients amplify their zonal temperature advection, causing their SSTA to extend farther west than observed. The models underestimate both ENSO's positive dynamic feedbacks (due to insufficient zonal wind stress responses to SSTA) and its thermodynamic damping (due to insufficient convective cloud shading of eastern Pacific SSTA during warm events); compensation between these biases leads to realistic linear growth rates for ENSO, but for somewhat unrealistic reasons. The models also exhibit stronger-than-observed feedbacks onto eastern equatorial Pacific SSTAs from thermocline depth anomalies, which accelerates the transitions between events and shortens the simulated ENSO period relative to observations. Implications for diagnosing and simulating ENSO in climate models are discussed.},

abstract = {The sub-seasonal to seasonal prediction project (S2S) is a 5-year project, established in 2013 by the World Weather Research Program (WWRP) and the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). This paper briefly describes the S2S project in the context of extended range prediction of extreme events. We provide evidence that S2S forecasts have the potential to predict the onset, evolution and decay of some large-scale extreme events several weeks ahead. For instance, S2S models displayed skill to predict high probabilities of extreme 2-m temperature anomalies over Russia during the worst week of the 2010 Russian heat wave up to 3 weeks in advance. In other cases, like for tropical cyclone prediction, S2S models can produce useful information on the probability of the occurrence of tropical storms within sufficiently large areas through the prediction of large-scale predictors, such as the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO). In future, S2S forecasts of extreme events could be integrated into a “ready-set-go” framework between seasonal and medium range forecasts, by providing an early warning of an extreme event a few weeks in advance. Finally, S2S forecasts can also be used to investigate the causality of some extreme events and we show evidence that the cold March 2013 over western Europe and North Asia was linked to a MJO event propagating over the western Pacific.},

abstract = {In January 2016, the Arctic experienced an extremely anomalous warming event after an extraordinary increase in air temperature at the end of 2015. During this event, a strong intrusion of warm and moist air and an increase in downward longwave radiation, as well as a loss of sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas, were observed. Observational analyses revealed that the abrupt warming was triggered by the entry of a strong Atlantic windstorm into the Arctic in late December 2015, which brought enormous moist and warm air masses to the Arctic. Although the storm terminated at the eastern coast of Greenland in late December, it was followed by a prolonged blocking period in early 2016 that sustained the extreme Arctic warming. Numerical experiments indicate that the warming effect of sea ice loss and associated upward turbulent heat fluxes are relatively minor in this event. This result suggests the importance of the synoptically driven warm and moist air intrusion into the Arctic as a primary contributing factor of this extreme Arctic warming event.},

abstract = {The evolving roles of anthropogenic aerosols (AER) and greenhouse gases (GHG) in driving large-scale patterns of precipitation and SST trends during 1920-2080 are studied using a new set of ''all-but-one-forcing'' initial-condition large ensembles (LEs) with the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1), which complement the original ''all-forcing'' CESM1 LE (ALL). The large number of ensemble members (15-20) in each of the new LEs enables regional impacts of AER and GHG to be isolated from the noise of the model's internal variability. Our analysis approach, based on running 50-yr trends, accommodates geographical and temporal changes in patterns of forcing and response. AER are shown to be the primary driver of large-scale patterns of externally forced trends in ALL before the late 1970s, and GHG to dominate thereafter. The AER and GHG forced trends are spatially distinct except during the 1970s transition phase when aerosol changes are mainly confined to lower latitudes. The transition phase is also characterized by a relative minimum in the amplitude of forced trend patterns in ALL, due to a combination of reduced AER and partially offsetting effects of AER and GHG. Internal variability greatly limits the detectability of AER-and GHG-forced trend patterns in individual realizations based on pattern correlation metrics, especially during the historical period, highlighting the need for LEs. We estimate that ,20{\%} of the spatial variances of observed precipitation and SST trends are attributable to AER and GHG forcing, although model biases in patterns of forced response and signal-to-noise may affect this estimate.},

abstract = {The regional climate of the western United States
shows clear footprints of interaction between
atmospheric circulation and orography. The unique
features of this diverse climate regime challenges
climate modeling. This paper provides detailed
analyses of observations and regional climate
simulations to improve our understanding and
modeling of the climate of this region. The primary
data used in this study are the 1/8degrees gridded
temperature and precipitation based on station
observations and the NCEP - NCAR global
reanalyses. These data were used to evaluate a 20-yr
regional climate simulation performed using the
fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University -
National Center for Atmospheric Research (Penn State
- NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5) driven by large-scale
conditions of the NCEP - NCAR reanalyses. Regional
climate features examined include seasonal mean and
extreme precipitation; distribution of precipitation
rates; and precipitation intensity, frequency, and
seasonality. The relationships between precipitation
and surface temperature are also analyzed as a means
to evaluate how well regional climate simulations
can be used to simulate surface hydrology, and
relationships between precipitation and elevation
are analyzed as diagnostics of the impacts of
surface topography and spatial resolution. The
latter was performed at five east - west transects
that cut across various topographic features in the
western United States. These analyses suggest that
the regional simulation realistically captures many
regional climate features. The simulated seasonal
mean and extreme precipitation are comparable to
observations. The regional simulation produces
precipitation over a wide range of precipitation
rates comparable to observations. Obvious biases in
the simulation include the oversimulation of
precipitation in the basins and intermountain West
during the cold season, and the undersimulation in
the Southwest in the warm season. There is a
tendency of reduced precipitation frequency rather
than intensity in the simulation during the summer
in the Northwest and Southwest, which leads to the
insufficient summer mean precipitation in those
areas. Because of the general warm biases in the
simulation, there is also a tendency for more
precipitation events to be associated with warmer
temperatures, which can affect the simulation of
snowpack and runoff.},

abstract = {A complete map of the ocean subsurface temperature is essential for monitoring aspects of climate change such as the ocean heat content (OHC) and sea level changes and for understanding the dynamics of the ocean/climate variation. However, global observations have not been available in the past, so a mapping strategy is required to fill the data gaps. In this study, an advanced mapping method is proposed to reconstruct the historical ocean subsurface (0-700 m) temperature field from 1940 to 2014 by using ensemble optimal interpolation with a dynamic ensemble (EnOI-DE) approach and a multimodel ensemble of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) historical and representative concentration pathway 4.5 simulations. The reconstructed field is a combination of two parts: a first guess provided by the ensemble mean of CMIP5 models and an adjustment by minimizing the analysis error with the assistance of error covariance determined by the CMIP5 models. The uncertainty of the field can also be assessed. This new approach was evaluated using a series of tests, including subsample tests by using data from the Argo period, idealized tests by specifying a truth field from the models, and withdrawn-data tests by removing 20{\%} of the observations for validation. In addition, the authors showed that the ocean mean state, long-term trends, and interannual and decadal variability are all well represented. Furthermore, the most significant benefit of this method is to provide an improved estimate of the long-term historical OHC changes since 1940, which have important implications for Earth's energy budget.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Sea ice volume has decreased in the last decades, evoked by changes in sea ice area and thickness. Estimates of sea ice area and thickness rely on a number of geophysical parameters which introduce large uncertainties. To quantify these uncertainties we use freeboard retrievals from ICESat and investigate different assumptions about snow depth, sea ice density and area. We find that uncertainties in ice area are of minor importance for the estimates of sea ice volume during the cold season in the Arctic basin. The choice of mean ice density used when converting sea ice freeboard into thickness mainly influences the resulting mean sea ice thickness, while snow depth on top of the ice is the main driver for the year-to-year variability, particularly in late winter. The absolute uncertainty in the mean sea ice thickness is 0.28 m in February/March and 0.21 m in October/November. The uncertainty in snow depth contributes up to 70{\%} of the total uncertainty and the ice density 30–35{\%}, with higher values in October/November. We find large uncertainties in the total sea ice volume and trend.

abstract = {The equilibrium response of atmospheric circulation to the direct radiative effects of natural or anthropogenic aerosols is investigated using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3) coupled to two different ocean boundary conditions: prescribed climatological sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and a slab ocean model. Anthropogenic and natural aerosols significantly affect the circulation but in nearly opposite ways, because anthropogenic aerosols tend to have a net local warming effect and natural aerosols a net cooling. Aerosol forcings shift the Intertropical Convergence Zone and alter the strength of the Hadley circulation as found in previous studies, but also affect the Hadley cell width. These effects are due to meridional gradients in warming caused by heterogeneous net heating, and are stronger with interactive SST. Aerosols also drive model responses at high latitudes, including polar near-surface warming by anthropogenic aerosols in summer and an Arctic Oscillation (AO)-type responses in winter: anthropogenic aerosols strengthen wintertime zonal wind near 60°N, weaken it near 30°N, warm the troposphere, cool the stratosphere, and reduce Arctic surface pressure, while natural aerosols produce nearly opposite changes. These responses are shown to be due to modulation of stratospheric wave-driving consistent with meridional forcing gradients in midlatitudes. They are more pronounced when SST is fixed, apparently because the contrast in land-ocean heating drives a predominantly wavenumber-2 response in the northern hemisphere which is more efficient in reaching the stratosphere, showing that zonal heating variations also affect this particular response. The results suggest that recent shifts from reflecting to absorbing aerosol types probably contributed to the observed decadal variations in tropical width and AO, although studies with more realistic temporal variations in forcing would be needed to quantify this contribution. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Progress toward understanding the causes of and
physical mechanisms involved in the 1988 North
American drought is reported. An earlier study
demonstrated that major sea surface temperature
(SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean, in
association with the 1988 La Nina, may have
disrupted atmospheric heating patterns by changing
the location and intensity of the intertropical
convergence zone and that such heating anomalies
could have initiated the circulation anomalies
across North America responsible for the drought. A
key issue of when the drought circulation anomalies
developed and their relation to changes in tropical
Pacific SSTs is examined. Although unusually dry
soil moisture and heat waves persisted into August,
the anomalous atmospheric conditions that brought on
the drought occurred in April, May, and June of
1988. The evolution of the Pacific SSTs and tropical
convection, as revealed by outgoing longwave
radiation, is shown to be consistent with the
development of the conditions favorable for
initiating the drought circulation pattern in April
through June of 1988. On the equator at
110-degrees-W, SST anomalies exceeded
-2.75-degrees-C in only April, May, and June and
were largest (-4.1-degrees-C) in May 1988. The
issues of how the 1988 La Nina differed from those
in the past and the importance of the whole SST
field in determining the anomalous diabatic heating
are also discussed. Diagnostic calculations of
atmospheric diabatic heating confirm that
atmospheric heating anomalies existed in the
tropical Pacific in association with the major SST
anomalies during this time. The link between the
anomalous heating and the tropical SSTs supports the
view that influences external to the atmosphere were
important and that the drought was not generated
solely by mechanisms internal to the atmosphere. The
distribution of diagnosed heating anomalies over
North America, together with a planetary wave model
response to idealized forcing, is described to
clarify the possible role of soil moisture anomalies
in perpetuating the drought. It is argued that
feedback-caused soil moisture anomalies may have
been secondary sources for the drought circulation
but could not have been the primary instigator. For
the most part, other diagnosed heating anomalies
during the drought are found to have little
influence on the North American region. Criteria to
help judge the ability of general circulation models
to simulate the drought are discussed.},

abstract = {It has recently been shown that extreme stratospheric events (ESEs) are followed by surface weather anomalies (for up to 60 days), suggesting that stratospheric variability might be used to extend weather prediction beyond current time scales. In this paper, attention is drawn away from the stratosphere to demonstrate that the originating point of ESEs is located in the troposphere. First, it is shown that anomalously strong eddy heat fluxes at 100 hPa nearly always precede weak vortex events, and conversely, anomalously weak eddy heat fluxes precede strong vortex events, consistent with wave–mean flow interaction theory. This finding clarifies the dynamical nature of ESEs and suggests that a major source of stratospheric variability (and thus predictability) is located in the troposphere below and not in the stratosphere itself. Second, it is shown that the daily time series of eddy heat flux found at 100 hPa and integrated over the prior 40 days, exhibit a remarkably high anticorrelation (−0.8)...},

An analysis of observations and models suggests that, in addition, the negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole tends to occur 14 months before an El Ni{\~{n}}o event, with implications for El Ni{\~{n}}o predictability. El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) consists of irregular episodes of warm El Ni{\~{n}}o and cold La Ni{\~{n}}a conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean1, with significant global socio-economic and environmental impacts1. Nevertheless, forecasting ENSO at lead times longer than a few months remains a challenge2,3. Like the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean also shows interannual climate fluctuations, which are known as the Indian Ocean Dipole4,5. Positive phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole tend to co-occur with El Ni{\~{n}}o, and negative phases with La Ni{\~{n}}a6,7,8,9. Here we show using a simple forecast model that in addition to this link, a negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole anomaly is an efficient predictor of El Ni{\~{n}}o 14 months before its peak, and similarly, a positive phase in the Indian Ocean Dipole often precedes La Ni{\~{n}}a. Observations and model analyses suggest that the Indian Ocean Dipole modulates the strength of the Walker circulation in autumn. The quick demise of the Indian Ocean Dipole anomaly in November–December then induces a sudden collapse of anomalous zonal winds over the Pacific Ocean, which leads to the development of El Ni{\~{n}}o/La Ni{\~{n}}a. Our study suggests that improvements in the observing system in the Indian Ocean region and better simulations of its interannual climate variability will benefit ENSO forecasts.},

abstract = {Initialized Earth System predictions are made by starting a numerical prediction model in a state as consistent as possible to observations and running it forward in time for up to 10 years. Skilful predictions at time slices from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), seasonal to interannual (S2I) and seasonal to decadal (S2D) offer information useful for various stakeholders, ranging from agriculture to water resource management to human and infrastructure safety. In this Review, we examine the processes influencing predictability, and discuss estimates of skill across S2S, S2I and S2D timescales. There are encouraging signs that skilful predictions can be made: on S2S timescales, there has been some skill in predicting the Madden–Julian Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation; on S2I, in predicting the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation; and on S2D, in predicting ocean and atmosphere variability in the North Atlantic region. However, challenges remain, and future work must prioritize reducing model error, more effectively communicating forecasts to users, and increasing process and mechanistic understanding that could enhance predictive skill and, in turn, confidence. As numerical models progress towards Earth System models, initialized predictions are expanding to include prediction of sea ice, air pollution, and terrestrial and ocean biochemistry that can bring clear benefit to society and various stakeholders. Initialized climate predictions offer distinct benefits for multiple stakeholders. This Review discusses initialized prediction on subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), seasonal to interannual (S2I) and seasonal to decadal (S2D) timescales, highlighting potential for skilful predictions in the years to come.},

abstract = {This review attempts to interpret the generalized scale invariance observed in common atmospheric variables---wind, temperature, humidity, ozone and some trace species---in terms of the computed emergence of ring currents (vortices) in simulations of populations of Maxwellian molecules subject to an anisotropy in the form of a flux. The data are taken from `horizontal' tracks of research aircraft and from `vertical' trajectories of research dropsondes. It is argued that any attempt to represent the energy distribution in the atmosphere quantitatively must have a proper basis in molecular physics, a prerequisite to accommodate the observed long-tailed velocity probability distributions and the implied effects on radiative transfer, atmospheric chemistry, turbulent structure and the definition of temperature itself. The relationship between fluctuations and dissipation is discussed in a framework of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and a link between maximization of entropy production and scale invariance is hypothesized.

abstract = {The Southern Oscillation (SO) is usually described
as the atmospheric component of the dynamically
coupled El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The
contention in this work, however, is that dynamical
coupling is not required to produce the
SO. Simulations with atmospheric general circulation
models that have varying degrees of coupling to the
ocean are used to show that the SO emerges as a
dominant mode of variability if the atmosphere and
ocean are coupled only through heat and moisture
fluxes. Herein this mode of variability is called
the thermally coupled Walker (TCW) mode. It is a
robust feature of simulations with atmospheric
general circulation models (GCMs) coupled to simple
ocean mixed layers. Despite the absence of
interactive ocean dynamics in these simulations, the
spatial patterns of sea level pressure, surface
temperature, and precipitation variability
associated with the TCW are remarkably
realistic. This mode has a red spectrum indicating
persistence on interannual to decadal time scales
that appears to arise through an off-equatorial
trade wind-evaporation-surface temperature feedback
and cloud shortwave radiative effects in the central
Pacific. When dynamically coupled to the ocean (in
fully coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs), the main
change to this mode is increased interannual
variability in the eastern equatorial Pacific sea
surface temperature and teleconnections in the North
Pacific and equatorial Atlantic, though not all
coupled GCMs simulate this effect. Despite the
oversimplification due to the lack of interactive
ocean dynamics, the physical mechanisms leading to
the TCW should be active in the actual climate
system. Moreover, the robustness and realism of the
spatial patterns of this mode suggest that the
physics of the TCW can explain some of the primary
features of observed interannual and decadal
variability in the Pacific and the associated global
teleconnections.},

Simulations of the energy exchange processes in models would benefit if the ice concentration were represented more accurately. Reanalysis simulations that use historical wind and temperature fields may develop erroneous ice concentration estimates; these can be corrected by using observed ice concentration fields. The ice concentration assimilation presented here is a new method based on nudging the model ice concentration toward the observed concentration in a manner that emphasizes the ice extent and minimizes the effect of observational errors in the interior of the pack. The nudging weight is a nonlinear function of the difference between the model and the observed ice concentration.

abstract = {Multi-year to decadal variability in a 100-year
integration of a BMRC coupled atmosphere-ocean
general circulation model (CGCM) is examined. The
fractional contribution made by the decadal
component generally increases with depth and
latitude away from surface waters in the equatorial
Indo-Pacific Ocean. The relative importance of
decadal variability is enhanced in off-equatorial
"wings" in the subtropical eastern Pacific. The
model and observations exhibit "ENSO-like" decadal
patterns. Analytic results are derived, which show
that the patterns can, in theory, occur in the
absence of any predictability beyond ENSO
time-scales. In practice, however, modification to
this stochastic view is needed to account for robust
differences between ENSO-like decadal patterns and
their interannual counterparts. An analysis of
variability in the CGCM, a wind-forced shallow water
model, and a simple mixed layer model together with
existing and new theoretical results are used to
improve upon this stochastic paradigm and to provide
a new theory for the origin of decadal ENSO-like
patterns like the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation
and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In this theory,
ENSO-driven wind-stress variability forces internal
equatorially-trapped Kelvin waves that propagate
towards the eastern boundary. Kelvin waves can
excite reflected internal westward propagating
equatorially-trapped Rossby waves (RWs) and
coastally-trapped waves (CTWs). CTWs have no impact
on the off-equatorial sub-surface ocean outside the
coastal wave guide, whereas the RWs do. If the
frequency of the incident wave is too high, then
only CTWs are excited. At lower frequencies, both
CTWs and RWs can be excited. The lower the
frequency, the greater the fraction of energy
transmitted to RWs. This lowers the characteristic
frequency (reddens the spectrum) of variability off
the equator relative to its equatorial
counterpart. At low frequencies, dissipation acts as
an additional low pass filter that becomes more
effective, as latitude increases. At the same time,
ENSO-driven off-equatorial surface heating anomalies
drive mixed layer temperature responses in both
hemispheres. Both the eastern boundary interactions
and the accumulation of surface heat fluxes by the
surface mixed layer act to low pass filter the
ENSO-forcing. The resulting off-equatorial
variability is therefore more coherent with low pass
filtered (decadal) ENSO indices [e.g. NINO3
sea-surface temperature (SST)] than with unfiltered
ENSO indices. Consequently large correlations
between variability and NINO3 extend further
poleward on decadal time-scales than they do on
interannual time-scales. This explains why decadal
ENSO-like patterns have a broader meridional
structure than their interannual counterparts. This
difference in appearance can occur even if ENSO
indices do not have any predictability beyond
interannual time-scales. The wings around 15-20
degrees S, and sub-surface variability at many other
locations are predictable on interannual and
multi-year time-scales. This includes westward
propagating internal RWs within about 25 degrees of
the equator. The slowest of these take up to 4 years
to reach the western boundary. This sub-surface
predictability has significant oceanographic
interest. However, it is linked to only low levels
of SST variability. Consequently, extrapolation of
delayed action oscillator theory to decadal
time-scales might not be justified.},

secondary role. In addition, the variability about

Departures from QE have motivated stochastic convective parametrization, which in its early stages may be viewed as a sensitivity study. Introducing plausible stochastic terms to modify the existing convective parametrizations can have substantial impact, but, as for so many aspects of convective parametrization, the results are sensitive to details of the assumed processes. We present observational results aimed at helping to constrain convection schemes, with implications for each of conventional, stochastic or 'superparametrization' schemes. The original vision of QE due to Arakawa fares well as a leading approximation, but with a number of updates. Some, like the imperfect connection between the boundary layer and the free troposphere, and the importance of free-tropospheric moisture to buoyancy, are quantitatively important but lie within the framework of ensemble-average convection slaved to the large scale. Observations of critical phenomena associated with a continuous phase transition for precipitation as a function of water vapour and temperature suggest a more substantial revision. While the system's attraction to the critical point is predicted by QE, several fundamental properties of the transition, including high precipitation variance in the critical region, need to be added to the theory. Long-range correlations imply that this variance does not reduce quickly under spatial averaging; scaling associated with this spatial averaging has potential implications for superparametrization. Long tails of the distribution of water vapour create relatively frequent excursions above criticality with associated strong precipitation events.},

abstract = {In this paper, we use a linear program to empirically decompose fitted neural networks into ensembles of low-bias sub-networks. We show that these sub-networks are relatively uncorrelated which leads to an internal regularization process, very much like a random forest, which can explain why a neural network is surprisingly resistant to overfitting. We then demonstrate this in practice by applying large neural networks, with hundreds of parameters per training observation, to a collection of 116 real-world data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This collection of data sets contains a much smaller number of training examples than the types of image classification tasks generally studied in the deep learning literature, as well as non-trivial label noise. We show that even in this setting deep neural nets are capable of achieving superior classification accuracy without overfitting.},

abstract = {Recent observed climate trends result from a combination of external radiative forcing and internally generated variability. To better contextualize these trends and forecast future ones, it is necessary to properly model the spatiotemporal properties of the internal variability. Here, a statistical model is developed for terrestrial temperature and precipitation, and global sea level pressure, based upon monthly gridded observational datasets that span 1921-2014. The model is used to generate a synthetic ensemble, each member of which has a unique sequence of internal variability but with statistical properties similar to the observational record. This synthetic ensemble is combined with estimates of the externally forced response from climate models to produce an observational large ensemble (OBS-LE). The 1000 members of the OBS-LE display considerable diversity in their 50-yr regional climate trends, indicative of the importance of internal variability on multidecadal time scales. For example, unforced atmospheric circulation trends associated with the northern annular mode can induce winter temperature trends over Eurasia that are comparable in magnitude to the forced trend over the past 50 years. Similarly, the contribution of internal variability to winter precipitation trends is large across most of the globe, leading to substantial regional uncertainties in the amplitude and, in some cases, the sign of the 50-yr trend. The OBS-LE provides a real-world counterpart to initial-condition model ensembles. The approach could be expanded to using paleo-proxy data to simulate longer-term variability.},

(6 ka BP) orbital forcing with two coupled
ocean-atmosphere models (FOAM and CSM) show
enhancement of monsoonal precipitation in parts of
the American Southwest. Central America and
northernmost South America during Northern
Hemisphere summer. The enhanced onshore flow that
brings precipitation into Central America is caused
by a northward displacement of the inter-tropical
convergence zone, driven by cooling of the
equatorial and warming of the northern subtropical
and mid-latitude ocean. Ocean feedbacks also enhance
precipitation over the American Southwest, although
the increase in monsoon precipitation there is
largely driven by increases in land-surface
temperature. The northward shift in the equatorial
precipitation band that causes enhanced
precipitation in Central America and the American
Southwest has a negative feedback effect on
monsoonal precipitation in northern South
America. The simulations demonstrate that
mid-Holocene aridity in the mid-continent of North
America is dynamically linked to the orbitally
induced enhancement of the summer monsoon in the
American Southwest, with a spatial structure (wet in
the Southwest and dry in the mid-continent) similar
to that found in strong monsoon years today. Changes
in winter precipitation along the west coast of
North America, in Central America and along the Gulf
Coast, caused by southward-displacement of the
westerly storm tracks, indicate that changes in the
Northern Hemisphere winter monsoon also play a role
in regional climate changes during the
mid-Holocene. Although the simulations with FOAM and
CSM differ in detail, the general mechanisms and
patterns are common to both. The model results thus
provide a coherent dynamical explanation for
regional patterns of increased or decreased aridity

Coordination has been achieved through the creation of new infrastructure, notably 11 Global Producing Centres (GPCs) for long-range forecasts, and definition of operational standards in forecast output and associated material. Examples discussed show improvements to the integration, usefulness and operational delivery of long-range forecast products to the world-wide climate community. Products are in wide use, and cover both predictive information, up to 6 mo ahead, and verification information indicating forecast quality. Proposals for future expansions of the role of GPCs are discussed, with a view to addressing the challenges presented by the development of the Global Framework for Climate Services. In particular, implementation of regular WMO-coordinated Global Seasonal Climate Updates is proposed, to provide authoritative, readily accessible advice on the state of the global climate and prospects for the next season. In addition we argue that the skill benefits provided by decadal-range predictions initialised with the observed climate state, relative to uninitialised (IPCC-type) predictions, are sufficient to begin similar international coordination in multiannual-to-decadal prediction, through extending the role of those GPCs that are developing decadalprediction capability. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

Cold air damming did not occur and the purpose of the case study is to diagnose a nonevent so that processes associated with cold air damming can be better isolated. An important finding is that the configuration of the antecedent synoptic-scale flow is crucial in determining whether cold air damming will evolve and be sustained.

abstract = {One of the major climatic changes apparent over the Arctic Ocean has been the amplified rate at which air temperature has been increasing relative to the global mean. There are multiple factors which play roles in this amplification, including changes in sea ice/albedo, atmospheric circulation, clouds, and water vapor. We investigate the positive feedback on temperature caused by increasing downward longwave radiation flux (DLF) associated with increasing atmospheric precipitable water (PW). The Japanese 25-year Reanalysis and ERA-Interim reanalysis are used to examine the role of the DLF/PW component of the water vapor feedback loop on the enhanced warming in the Arctic between 1979 and 2011. We find a nonlinear relationship between DLF and PW, which suggests that the sensitivity of DLF to changes in PW varies by season, with the highest in winter and the lowest in summer. The positive trends in DLF and PW are widespread over the Arctic during autumn and spring but are centered mainly over the Atlantic sector in winter. The strength of the PW feedback loop depends on both the sensitivity of DLF to changes in PW and the change in PW during 1979-2011. If, in the future, PW were to increase significantly during winter in the central and Pacific sectors of the Arctic, there could be an expansion of Arctic amplification during winter. We also examine the effect of changes in cloud cover and find that such changes account for a much smaller proportion of the changes in DLF than does PW.

The effects of Arctic sea-ice loss are not limited to the northern high latitudes, and reach deep into the tropics. Yet little is known about the effects of future Antarctic sea-ice loss outside of the southern high latitudes. Here, using a fully coupled climate model, we investigate the tropical response to Antarctic sea-ice loss and compare it with the response to Arctic sea-ice loss. We show that Antarctic sea-ice loss, similar to Arctic sea-ice loss, causes enhanced warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific and an equatorward intensification of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. We demonstrate that Antarctic sea-ice loss causes a mini global warming signal comparable to the one caused by Arctic sea-ice loss, and reminiscent of the response to greenhouse gases. We also show that ocean dynamics are key to capturing the tropical response to sea-ice loss. In short, we find that future Antarctic sea-ice loss will exert a profound influence on the tropics. Combined Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice losses will account for 20–30{\%} of the projected tropical warming and precipitation changes under the high-emissions scenario Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5.

This fundamental property of the climate system makes forecasting weather incredibly challenging: it's impossible to expect weather models to ever provide perfect predictions of the Earth system beyond timescales of approximately 2 weeks. Instead, atmospheric scientists look for specific states of the climate system that lead to more predictable behaviour than others. Here, we demonstrate how neural networks can be used, not only to leverage these states to make skillful predictions, but moreover to identify the climatic conditions that lead to enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we employ a neural network interpretability method called ``layer-wise relevance propagation'' to create heatmaps of the regions in the input most relevant for a network's output. For Earth scientists, these relevant regions for the neural network's prediction are by far the most important product of our study: they provide scientific insight into the physical mechanisms that lead to enhanced weather predictability. While we demonstrate our approach for the atmospheric science domain, this methodology is applicable to a large range of geoscientific problems.},

consistently in the southwest U.S., but the strength
of penetration of moisture anomalies into the
continent varies substantially. The most striking
change over the past 130 years is the initiation of
a "bipolar" ENSO-drought signature around 1920,
producing opposite-sign moisture anomalies in the
southwest and mid-Atlantic states. Shifts in
teleconnection patterns coincide with variations in
the strength of ENSO and in a North Pacific mode.},

abstract = {AbstractSpatial and temporal patterns of variability in spring onset are identified across western North America using a spring index (SI) model based on weather station minimum and maximum temperatures (Tmin and Tmax, respectively). Principal component analysis shows that two significant and independent patterns explain roughly half of the total variance in the timing of spring onset from 1920 to 2005. However, these patterns of spring onset do not appear to be linear responses to the primary modes of variability in the Northern Hemisphere: the Pacific–North American pattern (PNA) and the northern annular mode (NAM). Instead, over the period when reanalysis data and the spring index model overlap (1950–2005), the patterns of spring onset are local responses to the state of both the PNA and NAM, which together modulate the onset date of spring by 10–20 days on interannual time scales. They do so by controlling the number and intensity of warm days. There is also a regionwide trend in spring advancement of...},

abstract = {This paper describes the use of convolutional neural nets (CNN), a type of deep learning, to identify fronts in gridded data, followed by a novel postprocessing method that converts probability grids to objects. Synoptic-scale fronts are often associated with extreme weather in the midlatitudes. Predictors are 1000-mb (1 mb = 1 hPa) grids of wind velocity, temperature, specific humidity, wet-bulb potential temperature, and/or geopotential height from the North American Regional Reanalysis. Labels are human-drawn fronts from Weather Prediction Center bulletins. We present two experiments to optimize parameters of the CNN and object conversion. To evaluate our system, we compare the objects (predicted warm and cold fronts) with human-analyzed warm and cold fronts, matching fronts of the same type within a 100-or 250-km neigh-borhood distance. At 250 km our system obtains a probability of detection of 0.73, success ratio of 0.65 (or false-alarm rate of 0.35), and critical success index of 0.52. These values drastically outperform the baseline, which is a traditional method from numerical frontal analysis. Our system is not intended to replace human meteorologists, but to provide an objective method that can be applied consistently and easily to a large number of cases. Our system could be used, for example, to create climatologies and quantify the spread in forecast frontal properties across members of a numerical weather prediction ensemble.},

However, due to the characteristics of RS data such as high dimensionality and relatively small amounts of labeled samples available, performing RS image classification faces great scientific and practical challenges. In recent years, as new deep learning (DL) techniques emerge, approaches to RS image classification with DL have achieved significant breakthroughs, offering novel opportunities for the research and development of RS image classification. In this paper, a brief overview of typical DL models is presented first. This is followed by a systematic review of pixel-wise and scene-wise RS image classification approaches that are based on the use of DL. A comparative analysis regarding the performances of typical DL-based RS methods is also provided. Finally, the challenges and potential directions for further research are discussed.

abstract = {The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and
Quasi-Decadal Oscillation (QDO) observed in global
climate variability during the 20th Century (Allan,
2000) dominated tropical Indian Ocean climate
variability from 1993-2002. Both signals shared a
delayed action oscillator (DAO) similar to that
shared by corresponding signals in the tropical
Pacific Ocean (White et al., 2003), intensified in
the South Indian Ocean. Each signal was
characterized by a short-lived east-west tropical
dipole in sea level height (SLH) and sea surface
temperature (SST) variability, with the warm SST
phase in the western ocean transitioning to the cool
phase in response to slow, westward-propagating,
upwelling coupled Rossby waves in the tropical South
Indian Ocean. The cool phase in the eastern ocean
transitioning to the warm phase in response to slow,
eastward-propagating, downwelling equatorial coupled
waves. At both boundaries, the simultaneous
incidence of these coupled waves provides a delayed
negative feedback to tropical SST variability,
together producing a DAO that accounts for each
signal, similar to those observed in the Pacific
Ocean (White et al., 2003). This description allows
us to construct a DAO model of the ENSO in the
Indian Ocean that demonstrates how boundary
reflections of the coupled waves, their
intensification by wind stress forcing, and inherent
delays in their propagation yield observed frequency
and amplitude. Thus, warm SST variability in the
western tropical Indian Ocean during 1995, 1998, and
2002 arose not from zonal atmospheric
teleconnections originating with ENSO in the
tropical Pacific Ocean, but from a DAO intrinsic to
the tropical Indian Ocean that co-oscillated with
that governing ENSO in the tropical Pacific Ocean.},

abstract = {The U. S. Climate Variability and Predictability
(CLIVAR) working group on drought recently initiated
a series of global climate model simulations forced
with idealized SST anomaly patterns, designed to
address a number of uncertainties regarding the
impact of SST forcing and the role of
land-atmosphere feedbacks on regional drought. The
runs were carried out with five different
atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) and
one coupled atmosphere-ocean model in which the
model was continuously nudged to the imposed SST
forcing. This paper provides an overview of the
experiments and some initial results focusing on the
responses to the leading patterns of annual mean SST
variability consisting of a Pacific El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO)-like pattern, a pattern that
resembles the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation
(AMO), and a global trend pattern. One of the key
findings is that all of the AGCMs produce broadly
similar (though different in detail) precipitation
responses to the Pacific forcing pattern, with a
cold Pacific leading to reduced precipitation and a
warm Pacific leading to enhanced precipitation over
most of the United States. While the response to the
response over the United States tends to occur when
the two oceans have anomalies of opposite
signs. Further highlights of the response over the
United States to the Pacific forcing include
precipitation signal-to-noise ratios that peak in
spring, and surface temperature signal-to-noise
ratios that are both lower and show less agreement
among the models than those found for the
precipitation response. The response to the positive
SST trend forcing pattern is an overall surface
warming over the world's land areas, with
substantial regional variations that are in part
reproduced in runs forced with a globally uniform
SST trend forcing. The precipitation response to the
trend forcing is weak in all of the models. It is
hoped that these early results, as well as those
reported in the other contributions to this special
issue on drought, will serve to stimulate further
analysis of these simulations, as well as suggest
new research on the physical mechanisms contributing
to hydroclimatic variability and change throughout
the world.},

abstract = {Among the least understood interactions between physics and biology in the oceans are those that take place on the decadal scale. But this temporal scale is important because some of the greatest ecological events take place on this time scale. More than 50 years of measurement in the California Current System have revealed significant ecosystem changes, including a large, decadal decline in zooplankton biomass, along with a rise in upper-ocean temperature. The temperature change was a relatively abrupt shift around 1976-77, concurrent with other basin-wide changes associated with an intensification of the Aleutian Low-pressure system. This intensification generates temperature anomalies in the ocean by altering the patterns of net surface-heat fluxes, turbulent mixing, and horizontal transport. Changes in the mean abundance of zooplankton in the southern California Current have been attributed to variations in the strength of coastal upwelling, variations in the horizontal transport of nutrient-rich water from the north, or increased stratification due to warming, all of which could be affected by fluctuations in the Aleutian Low. Here we show that a deepening of the thermocline accompanied the warming and increased the stratification of the water column, leading to a decrease in the supply of plant nutrients to the upper layers. This is the most likely mechanism for the observed plankton decline, and subsequent ecosystem changes. A global change in upper-ocean heat content, accompanied by an increase in stratification and mixed-layer deepening relative to the critical depth for net production, could lead to a widespread decline in plankton abundance.},

provided information on the nature of this gradient

relation between fire and climate was examined on
centennial timescales by comparing fire-interval
distribution and fire synchrony between sites. The
pollen data indicate more fire-adapted vegetation
during the early-Holocene period (c. 9000 to 6700

more fire-sensitive taxa in the mid Holocene
(c. 6700 cal. yr BP to 2700 cal. yr BP) and modern
forest assemblages developing over the last c. 2700
years. Comparisons of fire-interval distributions
showed that the time between fires was similar
between two of the three combinations of sites,
suggesting that the moisture gradient has played an
important role in determining long-term fire
frequency. However, century-scale synchrony of fire
occurrence between the two sites with the largest
difference in effective precipitation suggests that
centennial-scale shifts in climate may have overcome
the environmental differences between these
locations. Asynchrony in fire occurrence between the
sites with more similar effective precipitation
implies that local conditions may have played an
important role in determining fire synchrony between
sites with similar long-term climate histories.},

These simulations were performed using the nominal 1° horizontal resolution configuration of the coupled model with both the “low-top” (40 km, with limited chemistry) and “high-top” (130 km, with comprehensive chemistry) versions of the atmospheric component. CESM2 contains many substantial science and infrastructure improvements and new capabilities since its previous major release, CESM1, resulting in improved historical simulations in comparison to CESM1 and available observations. These include major reductions in low-latitude precipitation and shortwave cloud forcing biases; better representation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation; better El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation-related teleconnections; and a global land carbon accumulation trend that agrees well with observationally based estimates. Most tropospheric and surface features of the low- and high-top simulations are very similar to each other, so these improvements are present in both configurations. CESM2 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.1–5.3 °C, larger than in CESM1, primarily due to a combination of relatively small changes to cloud microphysics and boundary layer parameters. In contrast, CESM2's transient climate response of 1.9–2.0 °C is comparable to that of CESM1. The model outputs from these and many other simulations are available to the research community, and they represent CESM2's contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6.},

Because climate-model simulations of the sea-ice loss differ substantially, we used a robust linear relationship between monthly-mean September sea-ice area and cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to infer the future evolution of Arctic summer sea ice directly from the observational record. The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 square meters of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO2 emission. On the basis of this sensitivity, Arctic sea ice will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 gigatons of CO2 emissions. Most models show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the modeled increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the modeled transient climate response.},

Here we apply causal discovery algorithms to sea level pressure data from a large set of climate model simulations and, as a proxy for observations, meteorological reanalyses. We demonstrate how the resulting causal networks (fingerprints) offer an objective pathway for process-oriented model evaluation. Models with fingerprints closer to observations better reproduce important precipitation patterns over highly populated areas such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, East Asia, Europe and North America. We further identify expected model interdependencies due to shared development backgrounds. Finally, our network metrics provide stronger relationships for constraining precipitation projections under climate change as compared to traditional evaluation metrics for storm tracks or precipitation itself. Such emergent relationships highlight the potential of causal networks to constrain longstanding uncertainties in climate change projections. Algorithms to assess causal relationships in data sets have seen increasing applications in climate science in recent years. Here, the authors show that these techniques can help to systematically evaluate the performance of climate models and, as a result, to constrain uncertainties in future climate change projections.},

satellite altimeter observations for 1993-2009 are
examined in the context of longer tide gauge records
and wind stress patterns. The dominant regional
trends are high rates in the western tropical
Pacific and minimal to negative rates in the eastern
Pacific, particularly off North America. Interannual
sea level variations associated with El
Nino-Southern Oscillation events do not account for
these trends. In the western tropical Pacific, tide
gauge records indicate that the recent high rates
represent a significant trend increase in the early
1990s relative to the preceding 40 years. This sea
level trend shift in the western Pacific corresponds
to an intensification of the easterly trade winds
across the tropical Pacific. The wind change appears
to be distinct from climate variations centered in
the North Pacific, such as the Pacific decadal
oscillation. In the eastern Pacific, tide gauge
records exhibit higher-amplitude decadal
fluctuations than in the western tropical Pacific,
and the recent negative sea level trends are
indistinguishable from these fluctuations. The
shifts in trade wind strength and western Pacific
sea level rate resemble changes in dominant global
modes of outgoing longwave radiation and sea surface
temperature. It is speculated that the western

Sea ice variability is quantified based on the leading empirical orthogonal function of sea ice concentration over the North Atlantic [the Greenland Sea ice dipole (GSD)], which, in its positive polarity, has anomalously high sea ice concentrations in the Labrador Sea region to the southwest of Greenland and low sea ice concentrations in the Barents Sea region to the northeast of Greenland. In weekly data for December through April, the VAR indicates that NAO index (N) anomalies cause like-signed anomalies of the standardized GSD index (G), and that G anomalies in turn cause oppositely signed anomalies of N.

We investigated the cultural context surrounding the use of perennial cover types-such as stream buffers, wetlands, cellulosic bioenergy stocks, and diverse cropping rotations-to restore water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem function within a Corn Belt agricultural mosaic in Iowa, USA. Through ethnographic techniques and 33 in-depth interviews, we examined what was most important to rural stakeholders about their countryside. We then used photo elicitation to probe how interviewees' assessments of farm practices involving perennial cover types were related to their sense of place. Our interviewees perceived their rural "countryside" as a linked social and biophysical entity, identifying strongly with the farming lifestyle and with networks of people across the landscape. While most interviewees approved of perennial farm practices on marginal agricultural land, implementation of these practices was neither a priority nor strongly assimilated into rural experience and ethics. We identified three scale boundaries in our interviewees' perception of place which present key challenges and opportunities for landscape change: landscape-community, individual-community, and community-institution. In all cases, community social norms and networks-exhibited at landscape spatial scales-may be instrumental in bridging these boundaries and enabling networks of perennial cover types that span privately owned and operated farms. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

of climate fields from sparse observational networks
of proxy data, employing the technique of reduced
space objective analysis, is applied to the
reconstruction of gridded Pacific Ocean Basin sea
surface temperature (SST) from coral stable isotope
(delta(18)O) data for the period 1607-1990. In this
approach we seek to reconstruct only the leading
modes of large-scale variability which are both
observed in the modern climate and resolved in the
proxy data. We find that the coral data verifiably
resolve two spatial patterns of SST variability. The
first and dominant pattern is that of the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). A second pattern
reflects uniform changes over most of the Pacific
Basin. Calibration and verification tests for
1856-1990 show that root-mean-square variance is
small (less than or equal to0.5degreesC RMS) and
reconstruction errors are large (less than or equal
to0.6degreesC RMS), limiting interpretation to the
tropical region. Periods of enhanced ENSO activity
similar to those observed in the past two decades
are evident in the reconstruction for the early
nineteenth century. The changing frequency of ENSO
warm phase events appears to coincide with warming
of the Pacific mean state inferred from similar
reconstruction efforts using tree ring indicators

abstract = {Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures over the
past 8000 years have been paced by the slow decrease
in summer insolation resulting from the precession
of the equinoxes. However, the causes of superposed
century-scale cold summer anomalies, of which the
Little Ice Age (LIA) is the most extreme, remain
debated, largely because the natural forcings are
either weak or, in the case of volcanism, short
lived. Here we present precisely dated records of
ice-cap growth from Arctic Canada and Iceland
showing that LIA summer cold and ice growth began
abruptly between 1275 and 1300 AD, followed by a
substantial intensification 14301455 AD. Intervals
of sudden ice growth coincide with two of the most
volcanically perturbed half centuries of the past
millennium. A transient climate model simulation
shows that explosive volcanism produces abrupt
summer cooling at these times, and that cold summers
can be maintained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks long
after volcanic aerosols are removed. Our results
suggest that the onset of the LIA can be linked to
an unusual 50-year-long episode with four large
sulfur-rich explosive eruptions, each with global
sulfate loading {\textgreater}60 Tg. The persistence of cold
summers is best explained by consequent
sea-ice/ocean feedbacks during a hemispheric summer
insolation minimum; large changes in solar
irradiance are not required. Citation: Miller,

Here we show, using a Lagrangian method, that a combination of very different airstreams contributed to this event: (i) warm low-level air of subtropical origin, (ii) initially cold low-level air of polar origin heated by surface fluxes, and (iii) strongly descending air heated by adiabatic compression. The poleward transport of these warm airstreams occurred along an intense low-level jet between a series of cyclones and a quasi-stationary anticyclone. The complex 3-D configuration that enabled this transport was facilitated by continuous warm conveyor belt ascent into the upper part of the anticyclone. This study emphasizes the combined role of multiple transport processes and transient synoptic-scale dynamics for establishing an extreme Arctic warm event.},

abstract = {Because of a lack of observations, historical
simulations of land surface conditions using land
surface models are needed for studying variability
and changes in the continental water cycle and for
providing initial conditions for seasonal climate
predictions. Atmospheric forcing datasets are also
needed for land surface model development. The
quality of atmospheric forcing data greatly affects
the ability of land surface models to realistically
simulate land surface conditions. Here a carefully
constructed global forcing dataset for 1948-2004
with 3-hourly and T62 (similar to 1.875 degrees)
resolution is described, and historical simulations
using the latest version of the Community Land Model
version 3.0 (CLM3) are evaluated using available
observations of streamflow, continental freshwater
discharge, surface runoff, and soil moisture. The
forcing dataset was derived by combining
observation-based analyses of monthly precipitation
and surface air temperature with intramonthly
variations from the National Centers for
Environmental Prediction-National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis, which
is shown to have spurious trends and biases in
surface temperature and precipitation. Surface
downward solar radiation from the reanalysis was
first adjusted for variations and trends using
monthly station records of cloud cover anomaly and
then for mean biases using satellite observations
during recent decades. Surface specific humidity
from the reanalysis was adjusted using the adjusted
surface air temperature and reanalysis relative
humidity. Surface wind speed and air pressure were
interpolated directly from the 6-hourly reanalysis
data. Sensitivity experiments show that the
precipitation adjustment (to the reanalysis data)
leads to the largest improvement, while the
temperature and radiation adjustments have only
small effects. When forced by this dataset, the CLM3
reproduces many aspects of the long-term mean,
annual cycle, interannual and decadal variations,
and trends of streamflow for many large rivers
(e.g., the Orinoco, Changjiang, Mississippi, etc.),
although substantial biases exist. The simulated
long-term-mean freshwater discharge into the global
and individual oceans is comparable to 921
river-based observational estimates. Observed soil
moisture variations over Illinois and parts of
Eurasia are generally simulated well, with the
dominant influence coming from precipitation. The
results suggest that the CLM3 simulations are useful
for climate change analysis. It is also shown that
unrealistically low intensity and high frequency of
precipitation, as in most model-simulated
precipitation or observed time-averaged fields,
result in too much evaporation and too little
runoff, which leads to lower than observed river
flows. This problem can be reduced by adjusting the
precipitation rates using observed-precipitation
frequency maps.},

However, through hypothesis testing, it was found that some interregional variability exists in the magnitude of various sounding parameters that the authors felt characterized the important aspects of the thermodynamic profile of freezing-rain environments. This variability seems to be related not only to local effects resulting from terrain variations and nearby water sources, but also from regional differences in synoptic-scale atmospheric environments favorable for freezing rain.

Here, we show that the linkage is not stable, and with an apparent interdecadal change in the late-1990s. Coinciding with Arctic surface warm anomalies in recent decades (1997–2017), the Siberian high has been significantly intensified, the East Asian jet stream has expanded westward, and an apparent Rossby wave has propagated from the Arctic to East Asia, suggesting an atmospheric teleconnection between midlatitudes and Arctic. In contrast, midlatitude atmospheric circulation anomalies coinciding with Arctic surface warm anomalies were barely statistically significant during 1979–1996. The associated strong anomalous ascending/descending motions and divergent/convergent upper troposphere air masses over the Arctic-Eurasian sector seem to have favored the midlatitude-Arctic linkage during 1997–2017. We further hypothesize that Arctic mid-tropospheric warming plays a crucial role for the linkage between midlatitudes and Arctic in boreal winter. Multi-model simulations support this, and also point to internal atmospheric variability as the cause for the interdecadal shift in the strength of the midlatitude-Arctic linkage.},

For projections of September 18 Arctic SIA change, internal variability accounts for as much as 40-60{\%} of the total 19 uncertainty in the next decade, while emissions scenario dominates uncertainty toward 20 the end of the century. Model structure accounts for approximately 60-70{\%} of the total 21 uncertainty by mid-century and declines to 30{\%} at the end of the 21st century in the 22 summer months. For projections of wintertime Arctic SIA change, internal variability 23 contributes as much as 50-60{\%} of the total uncertainty in the next decade and impacts 24 total uncertainty at longer lead times when compared to the summertime. In winter, 25 there exists a considerable scenario dependence of model uncertainty with relatively 26 larger model uncertainty under strong forcing compared to weak forcing. At regional 27 scales, the contribution of internal variability can vary widely and strongly depends on 28 the calendar month and region. For wintertime SIA change in the GIN and Barents 29 Seas, internal variability contributes approximately 60-70{\%} to the total uncertainty 30 over the coming decades and remains important much longer than in other regions. 31 We further find that the relative contribution of internal variability to total uncertainty 32 is state-dependent and increases as sea ice volume declines.

for Queensland, Australia as an aid to monitoring
climate variation and change. The rainfall index is
based on 17 stations and extends from 1890. The
temperature index is based on six stations and
extends from 1910. These series can be updated
promptly and although based on a small number of
stations appear to reflect the major climate
variations in Queensland over the past
century. There is no significant trend towards
wetter or drier conditions in Queensland in either
summer or winter. Although the State has recently
suffered from an extended drought, this dry period
does not appear to be particularly unusual in the
105-year record. In contrast, average and minimum
temperatures and the daily temperature range show
significant trends since 1910 in both summer and
winter. Minimum temperatures have increased and the
daily temperature range has decreased, especially in
the early winter season, April-May.},

Polar climate change provides new opportunities, such as shorter shipping routes between Europe and East Asia, but also new risks such as the potential for industrial accidents or emergencies in ice-covered seas. Here, it is argued that environmental prediction systems for the polar regions are less developed than elsewhere. There are many reasons for this situation, including the polar regions being (historically) lower priority, with fewer in situ observations, and with numerous local physical processes that are less well represented by models. By contrasting the relative importance of different physical processes in polar and lower latitudes, the need for a dedicated polar prediction effort is illustrated. Research priorities are identified that will help to advance environmental polar prediction capabilities. Examples include an improvement of the p...},

abstract = {To extend the linear stochastically forced paradigm
of tropical sea surface temperature (SST)
variability to the subsurface ocean, a linear
inverse model (LIM) is constructed from the
simultaneous and 3-month lag covariances of observed
3-month running mean anomalies of SST, thermocline
depth, and zonal wind stress. This LIM is then used
to identify the empirically-determined linear
dynamics with physical processes to gauge their
relative importance to ENSO evolution. Optimal
growth of SST anomalies over several months is
triggered by both an initial SST anomaly and a
central equatorial Pacific thermocline anomaly that
propagates slowly eastward while leading the
amplifying SST anomaly. The initial SST and
thermocline anomalies each produce roughly half the
SST amplification. If interactions between the sea
surface and the thermocline are removed in the
linear dynamical operator, the SST anomaly undergoes
less optimal growth but is also more persistent, and
its location shifts from the eastern to central
Pacific. Optimal growth is also found to be
essentially the result of two stable eigenmodes with
similar structure but differing 2- and 4-year
periods evolving from initial destructive to
constructive interference. Variations among ENSO
events could then be a consequence not of changing
stability characteristics but of random excitation
of these two eigenmodes, which represent different
balances between surface and subsurface coupled
dynamics. As found in previous studies, the impact
of the additional variables on LIM SST forecasts is
relatively small for short time scales. Over time
intervals greater than about 9 months, however, the
additional variables both significantly enhance
forecast skill and predict lag covariances and
associated power spectra whose closer agreement with
observations enhances the validation of the linear
model. Moreover, a secondary type of optimal growth
exists that is not present in a LIM constructed from
SST alone, in which initial SST anomalies in the
southwest tropical Pacific and Indian ocean play a
larger role than on shorter time scales, apparently
driving sustained off-equatorial wind stress
anomalies in the eastern Pacific that result in a
more persistent equatorial thermocline anomaly and a
more protracted (and predictable) ENSO event.},

abstract = {Recent Amazonian droughts have drawn attention to the vulnerability of tropical forests to climate perturbations. Satellite and in situ observations have shown an increase in fire occurrence during drought years and tree mortality following severe droughts, but to date there has been no assessment of long-term impacts of these droughts across landscapes in Amazonia. Here, we use satellite microwave observations of rainfall and canopy backscatter to show that more than 70 million hectares of forest in western Amazonia experienced a strong water deficit during the dry season of 2005 and a closely corresponding decline in canopy structure and moisture. Remarkably, and despite the gradual recovery in total rainfall in subsequent years, the decrease in canopy backscatter persisted until the next major drought, in 2010. The decline in backscatter is attributed to changes in structure and water content associated with the forest upper canopy. The persistence of low backscatter supports the slow recovery ({\textgreater}4 y) of forest canopy structure after the severe drought in 2005. The result suggests that the occurrence of droughts in Amazonia at 5-10 y frequency may lead to persistent alteration of the forest canopy.},

abstract = {Here the 1976-77 climate regime shift that was
accompanied by a remarkable change in the lead-lag
relationships between Indian Ocean sea surface
temperature (SST) and El Ni (n) over tildeo
evolution is shown. After the 1976-77 regime shift,
a correlation analysis suggests that southern Indian
Ocean SSTs observed during late boreal winter are a
key precursor in predicting El Ni (n) over tildeo
evolution as the traditional oceanic heat content
anomalies in the equatorial Pacific or zonal wind
anomalies over the equatorial western Pacific. The
possible physical mechanisms underlying this highly
significant statistical relationship are
discussed. After the 1976-77 regime shift, southern
Indian Ocean SST anomalies produced by Mascarene
high pulses during boreal winter trigger coupled
air-sea processes in the tropical eastern Indian
Ocean during the following seasons. This produces a
persistent remote forcing on the Pacific climate
system, promoting wind anomalies over the western
equatorial Pacific and modulating the regional
Hadley cell in the southwest Pacific. These
modulations, in turn, excite Rossby waves, which
produce quasi-stationary circulation anomalies in
the extratropical South Pacific, responsible for the
development of the southern branch of the ''
horseshoe '' El Nino pattern. The change of the
background SST state that occurred in the late 1970s
over the Indian Ocean may also explain why ENSO
evolution is different before and after the 1976-77
regime shift. These results shed some light on the
possible influence of global warming or decadal
fluctuations on El Nino evolution through changes in
teleconnection patterns between the Indian and
Pacific Oceans.},

abstract = {The Northern Hemisphere polar amplification of climate change is documented in models taking part in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and in the new version of the Community Climate System Model. In particular, the magnitude, spatial distribution, and seasonality of the surface warming in the Arctic is examined and compared among the models. The range of simulated polar warming in the Arctic is from 1.5 to 4.5 times the global mean warming. While ice-albedo feedback is likely to account for much of the polar amplification, the strength of the feedback depends on numerous physical processes and parametrizations which differ considerably among the models. Nonetheless, the mean sea-ice state in the control (or present) climate is found to influence both the magnitude and spatial distribution of the high-latitude warming in the models. In particular, the latitude of the maximum warming is correlated inversely and significantly with sea-ice extent in the control climate. Additionally, models with relatively thin Arctic ice cover in the control climate tend to have higher polar amplification. An intercomparison of model results also shows that increases in poleward ocean heat transport at high latitudes and increases in polar cloud cover are significantly correlated to amplified Arctic warming. This suggests that these changes in the climate state may modify polar amplification. No significant correlation is found between polar amplification and the control climate continental ice and snow cover.},

Results from in depth mental models interviews with members of the public (N = 28) and survey data from three counties in Florida (N = 460) show that a large majority of respondents have some hurricane experience, which influences their thinking about storm impacts, individual actions to mitigate the hazard, and vulnerability to the hazard. Comparison with results from previous research with warning system professionals (National Weather Service forecasters, media broadcasters, and public officials) indicates several gaps between professionals and laypeople including different perceptions of hurricane risks overall and related to flooding from storm surge.

Using two General Circulation Models (GCMs), the ensemble size is increased up to 300 ensemble members, beyond the recommended 100 members. After partitioning the response in groups of 100-ensemble members, the reproducibility of the results is evaluated, with a focus on the response of the mid-latitude jet streams in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. Both atmosphere-only and coupled ocean-atmosphere PAMIP experiments are analyzed. Substantial differences in the mid-latitude response are found among the different experiment subsets, suggesting that 100-member ensembles are still significantly influenced by internal variability, which can mislead conclusions. Despite an overall stronger response, the coupled ocean-atmosphere runs exhibit greater spread due to additional ENSO-related internal variability when the ocean is interactive. The lack of consistency in the response is true for anomalies that are statistically significant according to Student's-t and False Discovery Rate tests. This is problematic for the multi-model assessment of the response, as some of the spread may be attributed to different model sensitivities while it is due to internal variability. We propose a method to overcome this consistency issue, that allows for more robust conclusions when only 100 ensemble members are used.},

abstract = {P revious studies regarding connections between the Atlantic and Pacific basins often focused on the Walker circulation through the atmosphere, with the Atlantic driving the Pacific 1-5 , the Atlantic driving global decadal variability 6 , the Pacific driving the Atlantic 7-9 or the Atlantic affecting the Pacific via the tropical Indian Ocean 10. These influences are typically invoked for the tropics 11 , although other connections through the midlati-tudes have also been proposed 3,11 with interaction between Pacific and Atlantic decadal variability possibly important for midlatitude teleconnections 12. Two-way interactions between the Atlantic and Pacific have been reviewed for interannual timescales 11 , and for observations on decadal timescales 13 , although the short data record for the latter did not allow an analysis of the mechanisms involved. The tropical Atlantic forcing of the tropical Pacific via the anomalous Walker circulation is seen on both interannual and decadal timescales as noted by studies cited in the preceding. However, a major difference on the decadal timescale, which we address in this paper, is that convective heating anomalies in the tropical eastern Pacific, which have been shown to play roles in decadal-timescale Arctic and Antarctic sea ice responses through the Pacific-North American (PNA) and Pacific-South American (PSA) telecon-nection patterns, respectively 14-16 , also end up affecting the tropical North and South Atlantic. Since these processes are acting on decadal timescales, as opposed to the interannual timescale, the responses go beyond single seasons as in the interannual case 11. In addition, external forcings play a greater role on the decadal timescales shown here. Idealized pacemaker experiments For Pacific decadal variability positive phase (PDV+) minus PDV−, assuming approximate linearity of the interbasin connections, the specified SST pattern in the Pacific (Methods) is characterized by positive SST anomalies of over +0.5 °C over most of the tropical Pacific representing the positive PDV phase (Fig. 1a). There are statistically significant positive (same-sign) SST anomalies of several tenths of a degree over most of the tropical Atlantic (Fig. 1a) with significant positive precipitation anomalies that cover most of the Pacific tropics (Fig. 1b, values of around +0.4 mm d −1). There are mostly positive precipitation anomalies between about 30° N and 30° S in the Atlantic and a narrow band of negative anomalies near 20° S (Fig. 1b) with values of about ±0.2 mm d −1. For specified positive Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV+ minus AMV−), the tropical Pacific shows opposite-sign (nega-tive) SST anomalies with values of around −0.2 °C (Fig. 1c) that are roughly half the amplitude of the specified PDV pattern in Fig. 1a. Corresponding precipitation anomalies (Fig. 1d) are positive over much of the specified positive SST regions in the tropical Atlantic (values of over about +0.4 mm d −1) and negative (around −0.2 mm d −1) over most of the tropical Pacific. The large-scale east-west Walker circulation in the atmosphere connects the basins in the pacemaker experiments with enhanced vertical motion over tropical ocean regions with positive SST anomalies and anomalous descent to the east and west (Fig. 1e,f). Thus, for PDV+ minus PDV−, stronger upward vertical motion over the eastern tropical Pacific is associated with weaker Pacific trade winds (westerly anomaly winds in the lower troposphere), anomalous descent over the tropical Atlantic and Maritime Continent and upper-level outflow away from the enhanced vertical motion in the tropical Pacific (Fig. 1e). Similarly for the AMV+ minus AMV-, enhanced vertical motion over the tropical Atlantic is associated with outflow near 200 hPa to the west (easterly anomaly winds) and anomalous descent over the tropical Pacific with trade-wind acceleration there (easterly anomaly winds in the lower troposphere, Fig. 1f). Decadal climate prediction presumes there are decadal-timescale processes and mechanisms that, if initialized properly in models, potentially provide predictive skill more than one or two years into the future. Candidate mechanisms involve Pacific decadal variability and Atlantic multidecadal variability, elements of which involve slow fluctuations of tropical Pacific and Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from positive anomalies (positive phase) to negative anomalies (negative phase). Here we use model experiments to show that there tends to be a weak opposite-sign SST response in the tropical Pacific when observed SSTs are specified in the Atlantic, while there is a weak same-sign SST response in the tropical Atlantic when observed SSTs are specified in the tropical Pacific. Net surface heat flux in the Atlantic and ocean dynamics in the Pacific play contrasting roles in the ocean response to specified SSTs in the respective basins. We propose that processes in the Pacific and Atlantic are sequentially interactive through the atmospheric Walker circulation along with contributions from midlatitude teleconnections for the Atlantic response to the Pacific.

In coupled historical single-forcing simulations, aerosol forcing induces a deceleration of both the subpolar jet (SPJ) and the subtropical jet (STJ) in SH in austral winter. Atmospheric general circulation model experiments indicate that the STJ is weakened by an interhemisphere gradient in the zonal mean sea surface temperature (SST) and an anomalous cross-equatorial Hadley circulation, while the SPJ response shares similar feedbacks with the greenhouse gas forcing. Specifically, atmospheric eddy adjustments are important for the SPJ change. The atmospheric response unique to anthropogenic aerosol forcing (e.g., cross-equatorial Hadley cell and the weakened SH STJ) can be exploited for climate change attribution.},

abstract = {Higher temperatures increase the moisture-holding
capacity of the atmosphere and can lead to greater
atmospheric demand for evapotranspiration,
especially during warmer seasons of the year.
Increases in precipitation or atmospheric humidity
ameliorate this enhanced demand, whereas decreases
exacerbate it. In the southwestern United States
(Southwest), this means the greatest changes in
evapotranspirational demand resulting from higher
temperatures could occur during the hot-dry
foresummer and hot-wet monsoon. Here seasonal
differences in surface climate observations are
examined to determine how temperature and moisture
conditions affected evapotranspirational demand
during the pronounced Southwest droughts of the
1950s and 2000s, the latter likely influenced by
warmer temperatures now attributed mostly to the
buildup of greenhouse gases. In the hot-dry
foresummer during the 2000s drought, much of the
Southwest experienced significantly warmer
temperatures that largely drove greater
evapotranspirational demand. Lower atmospheric
humidity at this time of year over parts of the
region also allowed evapotranspirational demand to
increase. Significantly warmer temperatures in the
hot-wet monsoon during the more recent drought also
primarily drove greater evapotranspirational demand,
but only for parts of the region outside of the core
North American monsoon area. Had atmospheric
humidity during the more recent drought been as low
as during the 1950s drought in the core North
American monsoon area at this time of year, greater
evapotranspirational demand during the 2000s drought
could have been more spatially extensive. With
projections of future climate indicating continued
warming in the region, evapotranspirational demand
during the hot-dry and hot-wet seasons possibly will
be more severe in future droughts and result in more
extreme conditions in the Southwest, a
disproportionate amount negatively impacting
society.},

However, investigating the added value of those initialized decadal predictions over other sources of information typically used by stakeholders generally relies on forecast accuracy, while probabilistic aspects, although crucial to users, are often overlooked. In this study, the quality of the near-surface air temperature from initialized predictions has been assessed in terms of reliability, an essential characteristic of climate simulation ensembles, and compared to the reliability of noninitialized simulations performed with the same model ensembles. Here, reliability is defined as the capability to obtain a true estimate of the forecast uncertainty from the ensemble spread. We show the limited added value of initialization in terms of reliability, the initialized predictions being significantly more reliable than their noninitialized counterparts only for specific regions and the first forecast year. By analyzing reliability for different forecast system ensembles, we further highlight the fact that the combination of models seems to play a more important role than the ensemble size of each individual forecast system. This is due to sampling different model errors related to model physics, numerics, and initialization approaches involved in the multimodel, allowing for a certain level of error compensation. Finally, this study demonstrates that all forecast system ensembles are affected by systematic biases and dispersion errors that affect the reliability. This set of errors makes bias correction and calibration necessary to obtain reliable estimates of forecast probabilities that can be useful to stakeholders.},

(denoted ''reanalysis'') to produce a 40-year record
of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support
of the needs of the research and climate monitoring
communities. This effort involves the recovery of
land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft,
satellite, and other data; quality controlling and
assimilating these data with a data assimilation
system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis
period 1957-96. This eliminates perceived climate
jumps associated with changes in the data
assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis
uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data
assimilation system and a database as complete as
possible. The data assimilation and the model used
are identical to the global system implemented
operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except
that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210
km). The database has been enhanced with many
sources of observations not available in real time
for operations, provided by different countries and
organizations. The system has been designed with
advanced quality control and monitoring components,
and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a
Gray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output
archives are being created to satisfy different user
needs, including a ''quick look'' CD-ROM (one per
year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields
available twice daily, as well as surface,
top-of-the atmosphere, and isentropic
fields. Reanalysis information and selected output
is also available on-line via the Internet
(http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CDROM,
containing 13 years of selected observed, daily,
monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR
Reanalysis, is included with this issue. Output
variables are classified into four classes,
depending on the degree to which they are influenced
by the observations and/or the model. For example,
''C'' variables (such as precipitation and surface
fluxes) are completely determined by the model
during the data assimilation and should be used with
caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these
variables with observations and with several
climatologies shows that they generally contain
considerable useful information. Eight-day
forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful
for predictability studies and for monitoring the
quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of
reanalysis (1957-96) should be completed in early
1997. A continuation into the future through an
identical Climate Data Assimilation System will
allow researchers to reliably compare recent
anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since
changes in the observing systems will inevitably
produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel
reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated
for the periods immediately after the introduction
of new observing systems, such as new types of
satellite data. NCEP plans currently call for an
updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system
every five years or so. The successive reanalyses
will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the
comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.},

abstract = {Polar amplification of surface warming has previously been displayed by one of the authors in a simplified climate system model with no ice-albedo feedbacks. A physical mechanism responsible for this pattern is presented and tested in an energy balance model and two different GCMs through a series of fixed-SST and "ghost forcing" experiments. In the first ghost forcing experiment, 4 W/m2 is added uniformly to the mixed layer heat budget and in the second and third, the same forcing is confined to the tropics and extra-tropics, respectively. The result of the uniform forcing is a polar amplified response much like that resulting from a doubling of CO2. Due to an observed linearity this response can be interpreted as the sum of the essentially uniform response to the tropical-only forcing and a more localized response to the extra-tropical-only forcing. The flat response to the tropical forcing comes about due to increased meridional heat transports leading to a warming and moistening of the high-latitude atmosphere. This produces a longwave forcing on the high-latitude surface budget which also has been observed by other investigators. Moreover, the tropical surface budget is found to be more sensitive to SST changes than the extra-tropical surface budget. This strengthens the tendency for the above mechanism to produce polar amplification, since the tropics need to warm less to counter an imposed forcing. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 °C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017-2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018-2020 period.},

Part I of the study) are evaluated with respect to
the three dominant modes of global SST. Two of these
modes are associated with the statistically
significant, naturally occurring interannual and
interdecadal variability in the Pacific. The
remaining mode corresponds to the recent warming of
tropical sea surface temperatures. Time-evolving
teleconnections associated with Pacific SSTs delay

a regional climate model (RCM) is essential to
capture this variability because of its

suggests that these changes are due in part to the
recent increase in eastern Pacific SST off the
Mexican coast. To establish the physical linkage to
remote SST forcing, additional RAMS seasonal weather
prediction mode simulations were performed and these
results are briefly discussed. In order for RCMs to
be successful in a seasonal weather prediction mode

abstract = {Near-surface warming in the Arctic has been almost twice as large as the global average over recent decades - a phenomenon that is known as the 'Arctic amplification'. The underlying causes of this temperature amplification remain uncertain. The reduction in snow and ice cover that has occurred over recent decades may have played a role. Climate model experiments indicate that when global temperature rises, Arctic snow and ice cover retreats, causing excessive polar warming. Reduction of the snow and ice cover causes albedo changes, and increased refreezing of sea ice during the cold season and decreases in sea-ice thickness both increase heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere. Changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation, as well as cloud cover, have also been proposed to cause Arctic temperature amplification. Here we examine the vertical structure of temperature change in the Arctic during the late twentieth century using reanalysis data. We find evidence for temperature amplification well above the surface. Snow and ice feedbacks cannot be the main cause of the warming aloft during the greater part of the year, because these feedbacks are expected to primarily affect temperatures in the lowermost part of the atmosphere, resulting in a pattern of warming that we only observe in spring. A significant proportion of the observed temperature amplification must therefore be explained by mechanisms that induce warming above the lowermost part of the atmosphere. We regress the Arctic temperature field on the atmospheric energy transport into the Arctic and find that, in the summer half-year, a significant proportion of the vertical structure of warming can be explained by changes in this variable. We conclude that changes in atmospheric heat transport may be an important cause of the recent Arctic temperature amplification. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

between explosive volcanic eruptions and subsequent
El Nino climate events(1,2). This connection,
however, has remained controversial(3-5). Here we
present support for a response of the El
Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon(6,7) to
forcing from explosive volcanism by using two
different palaeoclimate reconstructions of El Nino
activity(8,9) and two independent, proxy-based
chronologies of explosive volcanic activity(5) from
AD 1649 to the present. We demonstrate a
significant, multi-year, El Nino-like response to
explosive tropical volcanic forcing over the past
several centuries. The results imply roughly a
doubling of the probability of an El Nino event
occurring in the winter following a volcanic
eruption. Our empirical findings shed light on how
the tropical Pacific ocean-atmosphere system may
respond to exogenous (both natural and
anthropogenic) radiative forcing.},

The weekly product has been available since 1993 and is widely used for weather and climate monitoring and forecasting. Errors in the satellite bias correction and the sea ice to SST conversion algorithm are discussed, and then an improved version of the OI analysis is developed. The changes result in a modest reduction in the satellite bias that leaves small global residual biases of roughly −0.03°C. The major improvement in the analysis occurs at high latitudes due to the new sea ice algorithm where local differences between the old and new analysis can exceed 1°C. Comparisons with other SST products are needed to determine the consistency of the OI. These comparisons show that the differences among products occur on large time- and space scales wit...},

abstract = {It has recently been proposed, within the framework
of the linear shallow-water equations, that tropical
Pacific decadal variability (PDV) can be accounted
for by basin modes with eigenperiods of 10 to 20 yr,
amplifying a midlatitude wind forcing with an
essentially white spectrum. Here the authors use a
different formalism of linear equatorial wave
theory. The Green's function is computed for the
wind-forced response of a linear equatorial
shallow-water ocean and uses the earlier results of
Cane and Moore to obtain a compact, closed form
expression for the motion of the equatorial
thermocline, which applies to all frequencies lower
than seasonal. This expression is new and allows a
systematic comparison of the effect of low- and
high-latitude winds on the equatorial
thermocline. At very low frequencies ( decadal time
scales), the planetary geostrophic solution used by
Cessi and Louazel is recovered, as well as the
equatorial wave solution of Liu, and a formal
explanation for this convergence is
given. Nonetheless, this more general solution leads
one to a different interpretation of the results. In
contrast to the aforementioned studies, the authors
find that the equatorial thermocline is inherently
more sensitive to local than to remote wind forcing
and that planetary Rossby modes only weakly alter
the spectral characteristics of the
response. Tropical winds are able to generate a
strong equatorial response with periods of 10 to 20
yr, while midlatitude winds can only do so for
periods longer than about 50 yr. The results suggest
that ocean basin modes are an unlikely explanation
of decadal fluctuations in tropical Pacific sea
surface temperature.do},

Although there has been significant interest in the enhanced warming that is occurring at high northern latitudes, a process known as arctic amplification, remarkably little is known about these midwinter warming events at the pole including their frequency, duration and magnitude as well as the environmental conditions responsible for their occurrence. Here we use buoy and radiosonde data along with operational weather forecasts and atmospheric reanalyses to show that such events are associated with surface cyclones near the pole as well as a highly perturbed polar vortex. They occur once or twice each decade with the earliest identified event taking place in 1959. In addition, the warmest midwinter temperatures at the North Pole have been increasing at a rate that is twice as large as that for mean midwinter temperatures at the pole. It is argued that this enhanced trend is consistent with the loss of winter sea ice from the Nordic Seas that moves the reservoir of warm air over this region northwards making it easier for weather systems to transport this heat polewards.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}An observation product for thin sea ice thickness (SMOS-Ice) is derived from the brightness temperature data of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. This product is available in near-real time, at daily frequency, during the cold season. In this study, we investigate the benefit of assimilating SMOS-Ice into the TOPAZ coupled ocean and sea ice forecasting system, which is the Arctic component of the Copernicus marine environment monitoring services. The TOPAZ system assimilates sea surface temperature (SST), altimetry data, temperature and salinity profiles, ice concentration, and ice drift with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The conditions for assimilation of sea ice thickness thinner than 0.4 m are favorable, as observations are reliable below this threshold and their probability distribution is comparable to that of the model. Two parallel Observing System Experiments (OSE) have been performed in March and November 2014, in which the thicknesses from SMOS-Ice (thinner than 0.4 m) are assimilated in addition to the standard observational data sets. It is found that the root mean square difference (RMSD) of thin sea ice thickness is reduced by 11 {\%} in March and 22 {\%} in November compared to the daily thin ice thicknesses of SMOS-Ice, which suggests that SMOS-Ice has a larger impact during the beginning of the cold season. Validation against independent observations of ice thickness from buoys and ice draft from moorings indicates that there are no degradations in the pack ice but there are some improvements near the ice edge close to where the SMOS-Ice has been assimilated. Assimilation of SMOS-Ice yields a slight improvement for ice concentration and degrades neither SST nor sea level anomaly. Analysis of the degrees of freedom for signal (DFS) indicates that the SMOS-Ice has a comparatively small impact but it has a significant contribution in constraining the system ({\&}gt; 20 {\%} of the impact of all ice and ocean observations) near the ice edge. The areas of largest impact are the Kara Sea, Canadian Archipelago, Baffin Bay, Beaufort Sea and Greenland Sea. This study suggests that the SMOS-Ice is a good complementary data set that can be safely included in the TOPAZ system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

using a RCM in a process study framework to
represent North American summer climate beyond the

its enhanced representation of the land surface
topography, the diurnal cycle of convective rainfall
is present. This diurnal cycle largely governs the
transitions associated with the evolution of the
North American monsoon with regards to rainfall, the
surface energy budget, and surface temperature. The
lower frequency modes of convective rainfall, though
weaker, account for rainfall variability at a remote
distance from elevated terrain. As in previous
studies with other RCMs, RAMS precipitation is
overestimated compared to observations. The Great
Plains low-level jet (LLJ) is also well represented
in both RAMS and NARR, but the Baja LLJ and

occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests,

Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountain top species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.},

abstract = {The theory of possibility described in this paper is related to the theory of fuzzy sets by defining the concept of a possibility distribution as a fuzzy restriction which acts as an elastic constraint on the values that may be assigned to a variable. More specifically, if F is a fuzzy subset of a universe of discourse U = {\{}u{\}} which is characterized by its membership function $\mu$F, then a proposition of the form "X is F", where X is a variable taking values in U, induces a possibility distribution t ̊x which equates the possibility of X taking the value u to $\mu$F(u)-the compatibility of u with F. In this way, X becomes a fuzzy variable which is associated with the possibility distribution t ̊x in much the same way as a random variable is associated with a probability distribution. In general, a variable may be associated both with a possibility distribution and a probability distribution, with the weak connection between the two expressed as the possibility/probability consistency principle. A thesis advanced in this paper is that the imprecision that is intrinsic in natural languages is, in the main, possibilistic rather than probabilistic in nature. Thus, by employing the concept of a possibility distribution, a proposition, p, in a natural language may be translated into a procedure which computes the probability distribution of a set of attributes which are implied by p. Several types of conditional translation rules are discussed and, in particular, a translation rule for propositions of the form "X is F is $\alpha$-possible", where $\alpha$ is a number in the interval [0,1], is formulated and illustrated by examples. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

Here surface air temperature from 20 climate models is analyzed to estimate the historical and future likelihood of hiatuses and “surges” (faster than expected warming), showing that the global hiatus of the early 21st century was extremely unlikely. A novel analysis of future climate scenarios suggests that hiatuses will almost vanish and surges will strongly intensify by 2100 under a “business as usual” scenario. For “CO2 stabilisation” scenarios, hiatus, and surge characteristics revert to typical 1940s values.

abstract = {Research into the mechanisms for the global warming slowdown or “hiatus” of 1998–2013 is reviewed here. Observational and modeling studies identify tropical Pacific sea surface temperature variability as a major pacemaker of global mean surface temperature (GMST) change, as corroborated by the GMST increase following a major El Ni{\~{n}}o event. Specifically, the decadal cooling of the tropical Pacific contributes to the recent global warming hiatus. This tropical Pacific pacemaker effect appears larger for decadal than interannual variability, but the decadal effect remains to be quantified from observations. Our critical review of the literature reveals that the internal and radiatively forced GMST changes are distinct in pattern, energetics, mechanism, and predictability. In contrast to greenhouse gas-induced warming that is spatially uniform in sign and driven by energy perturbations, internal variability in GMST is an order of magnitude smaller than spatial variations, for which ocean-atmosphere interaction is of first-order importance while planetary energetics is not. In fact, decadal variability in GMST is poorly correlated with net radiation at the top of the atmosphere, highlighting the need to distinguish internal and forced GMST change in planetary energy budget. While the planetary energy budget can now be closed observationally over multi-decadal periods, the recent hiatus highlights the need and challenges to measure and quantify decadal changes in both global ocean heat uptake (e.g., for the effect of radiative forcing on the hiatus) and heat redistribution in the ocean. Hiatus research has led to a wide recognition of the importance of internal variability for GMST trends over a decade and longer. The strengthened connection between the climate variability and change communities is an important legacy of hiatus research.},

shown to have a strong contribution in driving the

simulated drought is associated with a southward
shift of the continental rainbelt over central and
eastern Sahel, associated with an inter-hemispheric
SST mode (the southern hemisphere oceans warming
faster than the northern ones after 1970). The
analysis of idealized experiments further highlights
the importance of the Pacific basin. The related
increase of the tropospheric temperature (TT) over
the tropics is then suggested to dry the margin of
convection zones over Africa, in agreement with the
so-called "upped-ante" mechanism. A simple metric is
then defined to determine the ability of the CMIP3

Sahel drying and these mechanisms, in order to
determine the reliability of the twenty-first

the observed drought over the Sahel and consistent

then constructed. The results show that (a) the

The warming of the model atmosphere results in an enrichment of the moisture content in the air and an increase in the poleward moisture transport. The additional moisture is picked up from the tropical ocean and is brought to high latitudes where both precipitation and runoff increase throughout the yr.

calcite frequently contains a climate signal, but
one that is difficult to interpret in terms of
either rainfall or temperature. Over
glacial-interglacial time periods and decadal
sampling resolution, stalagmite delta O-18 clearly
contains a 'first order' climate signal where the
magnitude of changes in temperature and
ocean/atmospheric circulation dominate the delta
O-18 signature. However, at annual-biennial
resolution sampling, and within interglacial
periods, the magnitude of climate changes is
smaller, and variability in delta O-18 introduced by
soil, karst groundwater and cave processes can
introduce considerable uncertainty into the climatic
interpretation of stalagmite delta O-18
records. Here, two approaches that can quantify the
climate signal contained with stalagmite delta O-18
are discussed. Firstly, linear regression based
approaches are reviewed, which correlate stalagmite
delta O-18 with instrumental climate parameters such
as temperature and rainfall. The advantages and
disadvantages of complex linear regression
approaches that attempt to account for groundwater
mixing within the karst aquifer are
discussed. Secondly, a forward modelling approach is
introduced, where stalagmite delta O-18 is modelled
from rainfall delta O-18, surface climate parameters
and a simple karst hydrology model. Using a case
study from Gibraltar, this latter approach
demonstrates that between stalagmite variability in
delta O-18 of the order of 1 parts per thousand can
be explained solely by differences in karst
hydrology. Forward modelling suggests that a similar
variability in delta O-18 might be observed between
stalagmites within a cave, or between caves within a
homogenous climate region, and highlights the
difficulty in attempting to use delta O-18 as a

abstract = {Pronounced changes in the Arctic environment add a new potential driver of anomalous weather patterns in midlatitudes that affect billions of people. Recent studies of these Arctic/midlatitude weather linkages, however, state inconsistent conclusions. A source of uncertainty arises from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Thermodynamic forcing by a rapidly warming Arctic contributes to weather events through changing surface heat fluxes and large-scale temperature and pressure gradients. But internal shifts in atmospheric dynamics — the variability of the location, strength, and character of the jet stream, blocking, and stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) — obscure the direct causes and effects. It is important to understand these associated processes to differentiate Arctic-forced variability from natural variability. For example in early winter, reduced Barents/Kara Seas sea-ice coverage may reinforce existing atmospheric teleconnections between the North Atlantic/Arctic and central Asia, and affect downstream weather in East Asia. Reduced sea ice in the Chukchi Sea can amplify atmospheric ridging of high pressure near Alaska, influencing downstream weather across North America. In late winter southward displacement of the SPV, coupled to the troposphere, leads to weather extremes in Eurasia and North America. Combined tropical and sea ice conditions can modulate the variability of the SPV. Observational evidence for Arctic/midlatitude weather linkages continues to accumulate, along with understanding of connections with pre-existing climate states. Relative to natural atmospheric variability, sea-ice loss alone has played a secondary role in Arctic/midlatitude weather linkages; the full influence of Arctic amplification remains uncertain.},

abstract = {Heat and drought are two emerging climatic threats to the US maize and soybean production, yet their impacts on yields are collectively determined by the magnitude of climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This study quantifies the combined and separate impacts of high temperature, heat and drought stresses on the current and future US rainfed maize and soybean production and for the first time characterizes spatial shifts in the relative importance of individual stress. Crop yields are simulated using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), driven by high-resolution (12 km) dynamically downscaled climate projections for 1995–2004 and 2085–2094. Results show that maize and soybean yield losses are prominent in the US Midwest by the late 21st century under both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, and the magnitude of loss highly depends on the current vulnerability and changes in climate extremes. Elevated atmospheric CO2 partially but not completely offsets the yield gaps caused by climate extremes, and the effect is greater in soybean than in maize. Our simulations suggest that drought will continue to be the largest threat to US rainfed maize production under RCP4.5 and soybean production under both RCP scenarios, whereas high temperature and heat stress take over the dominant stress of drought on maize under RCP8.5. We also reveal that shifts in the geographic distributions of dominant stresses are characterized by the increase in concurrent stresses, especially for the US Midwest. These findings imply the importance of considering heat and drought stresses simultaneously for future agronomic adaptation and mitigation strategies, particularly for breeding programs and crop management. The modeling framework of partitioning the total effects of climate change into individual stress impacts can be applied to the study of other crops and agriculture systems.},

abstract = {[1] Among other longer-than-22-year periods in
Fourier spectra of various solar-terrestrial
records, the 88-year cycle is unique, because it can
be directly linked to the cyclic activity of sunspot
formation. Variations of amplitude as well as of
period of the Schwabe 11-year cycle of sunspot
activity have actually been known for a long time
and a ca. 80-year cycle was detected in those
variations. Manifestations of such secular periodic
processes were reported in a broad variety of solar,
solar-terrestrial, and terrestrial climatic
phenomena. Confirmation of the existence of the
Gleissberg cycle in long solar terrestrial records
as well as the question of its stability is of great
significance for solar dynamo theories. For that
perspective, we examined the longest detailed
cosmogenic isotope record-INTCAL98 calibration
record of atmospheric C-14 abundance. The most
detailed precisely dated part of the record extends
back to 11, 854 years B. P. During this whole
period, the Gleissberg cycle in C-14 concentration
has a period of 87.8 years and an average amplitude
of similar to1parts per thousand (in Delta(14)C
units). Spectral analysis indicates in frequency
domain by sidebands of the combination tones at
periods of approximate to91.5 +/- 0.1 and
approximate to84.6 +/- 0.1 years that the amplitude
of the Gleissberg cycle appears to be modulated by
other long-term quasiperiodic process of timescale
similar to2000 years. This is confirmed directly in
time domain by bandpass filtering and time-frequency
analysis of the record. Also, there is additional
evidence in the frequency domain for the modulation
of the Gleissberg cycle by other millennial scale
processes. Attempts have been made to explain 20th
century global warming exclusively by the component
of irradiance variation associated with the
Gleissberg cycle. These attempts fail, because they
require unacceptably great solar forcing and are
incompatible with the paleoclimatic records.},

A simple approximate theory [similar to that introduced by Schneider (1977)] is developed for the case in which the fluid is sufficiently inviscid that the poleward flow in the Hadley cell is nearly angular momentum conserving. The theory predicts the width of the Hadley cell, the total poleward heat flux, the latitude of the upper level jet in the zonal wind, and the distribution of surface easterlies and westerlies. Fundamental differences between such nearly inviscid circulations and the more commonly studied viscous axisymmetric flows are emphasized. The theory is checked against numerical solutions to the model equations.},

The extratropical QBO discussed by Holton and Tan existed in both temporal halves of the dataset. Autocorrelation analysis demonstrated that it was an important mode of interannual variability in the extratropical winter stratosphere. Correlation with the tropics was strongest when 40-mb equatorial winds were used to define the tropical QBO. Easterly phase at 40 mb implied a weaker than normal polar night jet and warmer than normal polar temperature and vice versa. An opposite relationship was obtained using 10-mb equatorial winds. The association between tropical and extra-tropical QBOs was observed in about 90{\%} of the winters and was statistically significant.

@article{chen02,
abstract = {This paper describes the initial work toward the
production of monthly global (land and ocean)
analyses of precipitation for an extended period
from 1948 to the present. Called the precipitation
reconstruction (PREC), the global analyses are
defined by interpolation of gauge observations over
land (PREC/L) and by EOF reconstruction of
historical observations over ocean (PREC/O). This
paper documents the creation of the land component
of the analyses (PREC/L) on a 2.5degrees
latitude/longitude grid for 1948-2000. These
analyses are derived from gauge observations from
over 17 000 stations collected in the Global
Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), version 2,
and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System (CAMS)
datasets. To determine the most suitable objective
analysis procedure for gridding, the analyses
generated by four published objective analysis
techniques [those of Cressman, Barnes, and Shepard,
and the optimal interpolation (OI) method of Gandin]
were compared. The evaluation demonstrated two
crucial points: 1) better results are obtained when
interpolating anomalies rather than the
precipitation totals, and 2) the OI analysis
procedure provided the most accurate and stable
analyses among the four algorithms that were
tested. Based on these results, the OI technique was
used to create monthly gridded analyses of
precipitation over the global land areas for the
53-yr period from 1948 to 2000. In addition, some
diagnostic investigations of the seasonal and
interannual variability of large-scale precipitation
over the global land areas are presented. The mean
distribution and annual cycle of precipitation
observed in the PREC/L showed good agreement with
those in several published gauge-based datasets, and
the anomaly patterns associated with ENSO resemble
those found in previous studies. The gauge-based
dataset (PREC/L) will be updated on a
quasi-real-time basis and is available online

abstract = {Traces of environmental conditions found in natural archives can serve as proxies for direct climate measurements to extend our knowledge of past climate variability beyond the relatively short instrumental record. Such paleoclimate proxies have demonstrated significant multidecadal climate variability in the Atlantic sector since at least the mid-1700s. However, Atlantic multidecadal climate variability is primarily defined by fluctuations in sea surface temperature (SST) and the proxy evidence comes from a variety of sources, many of which are terrestrial and are not directly recording sea surface temperature. Further analysis into the causes and consequences of Atlantic multidecadal climate variability requires development of a spatial network of decadal resolution proxy SST records with both low and high latitude contributions. An initial attempt at a low latitude Atlantic SST reconstruction found only 4 sites with ≤5year resolution data, demonstrating the paucity of appropriate data available. The 4-site average correlated significantly with instrumental average SST and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The full record, 1360–2000C.E., and a shortened version 1460–1850C.E., had significant multidecadal variability centered at a 60-year period. Comparing our reconstruction with reconstructions of SST anomalies in the North Atlantic shows that there is no consensus yet on the history of Atlantic multidecadal variability.},

signals in time series with a characteristic 'red'
noise background which arises from temporal
persistence. This background is estimated by a
'robust' procedure that, unlike conventional
techniques, is largely unbiased by the presence of
signals immersed in the noise. Making use of
multiple-taper spectral analysis methods, the
technique further provides for a distinction between
purely harmonic (periodic) signals, and broader-band
('quasiperiodic') signals. The effectiveness of our
signal detection procedure is demonstrated with
synthetic examples that simulate a variety of
possible periodic and quasiperiodic signals immersed
in red noise. We apply our methodology to historical
climate and paleoclimate time series
examples. Analysis of a approximate to 3 million
year sediment core reveals significant periodic
components at known astronomical forcing
periodicities and a significant quasiperiodic 100
year peak. Analysis of a roughly 1500 year tree-ring

suggests significant quasiperiodic signals on a
near-century timescale, an interdecadal 16-18 year
timescale, within the interannual El Ninio/Southem

abstract = {Detecting extreme events in large datasets is a major challenge in climate science research. Current algorithms for extreme event detection are build upon human expertise in defining events based on subjective thresholds of relevant physical variables. Often, multiple competing methods produce vastly different results on the same dataset. Accurate characterization of extreme events in climate simulations and observational data archives is critical for understanding the trends and potential impacts of such events in a climate change content. This study presents the first application of Deep Learning techniques as alternative methodology for climate extreme events detection. Deep neural networks are able to learn high-level representations of a broad class of patterns from labeled data. In this work, we developed deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification system and demonstrated the usefulness of Deep Learning technique for tackling climate pattern detection problems. Coupled with Bayesian based hyper-parameter optimization scheme, our deep CNN system achieves 89$\backslash${\%}-99$\backslash${\%} of accuracy in detecting extreme events (Tropical Cyclones, Atmospheric Rivers and Weather Fronts},

abstract = {This study uses data from a survey of coastal Miami-Dade County, Florida, residents to explore how different types of forecast and warning messages influence evacuation decisions, in conjunction with other factors. The survey presented different members of the public with different test messages about the same hypothetical hurricane approaching Miami. Participants' responses to the information were evaluated using questions about their likelihood of evacuating and their perceptions of the information and the information source. Recipients of the test message about storm surge height and the message about extreme impacts from storm surge had higher evacuation intentions, compared to nonrecipients. However, recipients of the extreme-impacts message also rated the information as more overblown and the information source as less reliable. The probabilistic message about landfall location interacted with the other textual messages in unexpected ways, reducing the other messages' effects on evacuation intentions. These results illustrate the importance of considering trade-offs, unintended effects, and information interactions when deciding how to convey weather information. Recipients of the test message that described the effectiveness of evacuation had lower perceptions that the information was overblown, suggesting the potential value of efficacy messaging. In addition, respondents with stronger individualist worldviews rated the information as significantly more overblown and had significantly lower evacuation intentions. This illustrates the importance of understanding how and why responses to weather messages vary across subpopulations. Overall, the analysis demonstrates the potential value of systematically investigating how different people respond to different types of weather risk messages.},

abstract = {The Australian-Indonesian summer monsoon affects
rainfall variability and hence terrestrial
productivity in the densely populated tropical
Indo-Pacific region. It has been proposed that the
main control of summer monsoon precipitation on
millennial timescales is local insolation(1-3), but
unravelling the mechanisms that have influenced
monsoon variability and teleconnections has proven
difficult, owing to the lack of high-resolution
records of past monsoon behaviour. Here we present a
precisely dated reconstruction of monsoon rainfall
over the past 12,000 years, based on oxygen isotope
measurements from two stalagmites collected in
southeast Indonesia. We show that the summer monsoon
precipitation increased during the Younger Dryas
cooling event, when Atlantic meridional overturning
circulation was relatively weak(4). Monsoon
precipitation intensified even more rapidly from
11,000 to 7,000 years ago, when the Indonesian
continental shelf was flooded by global sea-level
rise(5-7). We suggest that the intensification
during the Younger Dryas cooling was caused by
enhanced winter monsoon outflow from Asia and a
related southward migration of the intertropical
convergence zone(8). However, the early Holocene
intensification of monsoon precipitation was driven
by sea-level rise, which increased the supply of

Here, through analysis of large ensembles of fully coupled climate model simulations with historical radiative forcing, we present an important internal mechanism arising from low-frequency Arctic atmospheric variability in models that can cause substantial summer sea ice melting in addition to that due to anthropogenic forcing. This simulated internal variability shows a strong similarity to the observed Arctic atmospheric change in the past 37 years. Through a fingerprint pattern matching method, we estimate that this internal variability contributes to about 40–50{\%} of observed multi-decadal decline in Arctic sea ice. Our study also suggests that global climate models may not actually underestimate sea ice sensitivities in the Arctic, but have trouble fully replicating an observed linkage between the Arctic and lower latitudes in recent decades. Further improvements in simulating the observed Arctic–global linkage are thus necessary before the Arctic's sensitivity to global warming in models can be quantified with confidence.},

The hypothesis is investigated with a simple mathe-matical model. An equation whose dependent variables are ensemble averages of the ''error energy " in separate scales of motion is derived from the vorticity equation which governs two-dimensional incompressible flow. Solutions of the equation are determined by numerical integration, for cases where the horizontal extent and total energy of the system are comparable to those of the earth's atomsphere. It is found that each scale of motion possesses an intrinsic finite range of predictabi-lity, provided that the total energy of the system does not fall off too rapidly with decreasing wave length. With the chosen values of the constants, " cumulus-scale " motions can be predicted about one hour, " synoptic-scale " motions a few days, and the largest scales a few weeks in advance. The applicability of the model to real physical systems, including the earth's atmosphere, is considered.},

abstract = {Quantifying signals and uncertainties in climate models is essential for the detection, attribution, prediction and projection of climate change 1-3. Although inter-model agreement is high for large-scale temperature signals, dynamical changes in atmospheric circulation are very uncertain 4. This leads to low confidence in regional projections, especially for precipitation, over the coming decades 5,6. The chaotic nature of the climate system 7-9 may also mean that signal uncertainties are largely irreducible. However, climate projections are difficult to verify until further observations become available. Here we assess retrospective climate model predictions of the past six decades and show that decadal variations in North Atlantic winter climate are highly predictable, despite a lack of agreement between individual model simulations and the poor predictive ability of raw model outputs. Crucially, current models underestimate the predictable signal (the predictable fraction of the total variability) of the North Atlantic Oscillation (the leading mode of variability in North Atlantic atmospheric circulation) by an order of magnitude. Consequently, compared to perfect models, 100 times as many ensemble members are needed in current models to extract this signal, and its effects on the climate are underestimated relative to other factors. To address these limitations, we implement a two-stage post-processing technique. We first adjust the variance of the ensemble-mean North Atlantic Oscillation forecast to match the observed variance of the predictable signal. We then select and use only the ensemble members with a North Atlantic Oscillation sufficiently close to the variance-adjusted ensemble-mean forecast North Atlantic Oscillation. This approach greatly improves decadal predictions of winter climate for Europe and eastern North America. Predictions of Atlantic multidecadal variability are also improved, suggesting that the North Atlantic Oscillation is not driven solely by Atlantic multidecadal variability. Our results highlight the need to understand why the signal-to-noise ratio is too small in current climate models 10 , and the extent to which correcting this model error would reduce uncertainties in regional climate change projections on timescales beyond a decade. Global climate models are used extensively to understand the drivers of past climate variability and change, and to predict what is likely to happen in the future 1-3. Underpinning this is a need for accurate estimates of signals and associated uncertainties in climate model simulations, to distinguish between different causes of past climate change and to provide reliable confidence limits on future projections. Uncertainties are typically partitioned into three sources 11 : scenario uncertainty arising from an imperfect knowledge of external forcing factors, including changes in greenhouse gases, ozone, anthropogenic and volcanic aerosols, and solar irradiance; modelling uncertainty arising from the fact that different models respond differently to the same radiative forcing; and internal climate variability that would occur in the absence of any external forcing. Climate projections for many regions are currently highly uncertain, especially for atmospheric circulation 4,12 and related effects, including precipitation 5,6. This is particularly well illustrated by the fact that modelling 13,14 and internal variability 7,8 uncertainties are each large enough to allow opposite projections of European winters, especially https://doi.},

discrete population types that differ in their
flowering (fall versus winter) as well as leafing

populations have similar pollen:ovule ratios, index
of self incompatibility, stigma receptivity
duration, pollen longevity, flower longevity, floral
morphology and seed production rate. These data
indicate no apparent selective pressure on floral
characteristics or on the breeding system, which may
be exerted by the pollinators. The two populations
retained their autonomous blooming rhythm even after
transplantation, which indicated that this character
was genetically determined. There are no genetic
barriers and the populations may share some
pollinators (Schwartz-Tzachor et al. 2006). Thus the
main potential restriction on gene flow is the
incomplete phenological barrier. These findings may
indirectly support our hypothesis that the
phenological shift is due to environmental
cues. Thus it was concluded that these two types are
'phenological ecotypes' in the sense of Turesson
(1922) due to the unequivocal delineation of both
types, as revealed by the timing of leaf appearance
(synanthous versus hysteranthous) without any

@article{Hamill2011,
abstract = {Verification was performed on ensemble forecasts of 2009 Northern Hemisphere summer tropical cyclones (TCs) from two experimental global numerical weather prediction ensemble prediction systems (EPSs). The first model was a high-resolution version (T382L64) of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS). The second model was a 30-km version of the experimental NOAA/Earth System Research Laboratory's Flow-following finite-volume Icosahedral Model (FIM). Both models were initialized with the first 20 members of a 60-member ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) using the T382L64 GFS. The GFS-EnKF assimilated the full observational data stream that was normally assimilated into the NCEP operational Global Statistical Interpolation (GSI) data assimilation, plus human-synthesized "observations" of tropical cyclone central pressure and position produced at the National Hurricane Center and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The forecasts from the two experimental ensembles were compared against four operational EPSs from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), NCEP, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC), and the Met Office (UKMO). The errors of GFS-EnKF ensemble track forecasts were competitive with those from the ECMWF ensemble system, and the overall spread of the ensemble tracks was consistent in magnitude with the track error. Both experimental EPSs had much lower errors than the operational NCEP, UKMO, and CMC EPSs, but the FIM-EnKF tracks were somewhat less accurate than the GFS-EnKF. The ensemble forecasts were often stretched in particular directions, and not necessarily along or across track. The better-performing EPSs provided useful information on potential track error anisotropy. While the GFS-EnKF initialized relatively deep vortices by assimilating the TC central pressure estimate, the model storms filled during the subsequent 24 h. Other forecast models also systematically underestimated TC intensity (e.g., maximum forecast surface wind speed). The higher-resolution models generally had less bias. Analyses were conducted to try to understand whether the additional central pressure observation, the EnKF, or the extra resolution was most responsible for the decrease in track error of the experimental Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS)-EnKF over the operational NCEP. The assimilation of the additional TC observations produced only a small change in deterministic track forecasts initialized with the GSI. The T382L64 GFS-EnKF ensemble was used to initialize a T126L28 ensemble forecast to facilitate a comparison with the operationalNCEP system. The T126L28GFS-EnKFEPS track forecasts were dramatically better than the NCEP operational, suggesting the positive impact of the EnKF, perhaps through improved steering flow. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The winter North Atlantic Oscillation is the primary mode of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic region and has a profound influence on European and North American winter climate. Until recently, seasonal variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation was thought to be largely driven by chaotic and inherently unpredictable processes. However, latest generation seasonal forecasting systems have demonstrated significant skill in predicting the North Atlantic Oscillation when initialized a month before the onset of winter. Here we extend skilful dynamical model predictions to more than a year ahead. The skill increases greatly with ensemble size due to a spuriously small signal-to-noise ratio in the model, and consequently larger ensembles are projected to further increase the skill in predicting the North Atlantic Oscillation. We identify two sources of skill for second-winter forecasts of the North Atlantic Oscillation: climate variability in the tropical Pacific region and predictable effects of solar forcing on the stratospheric polar vortex strength. We also identify model biases in Arctic sea ice that, if reduced, may further increase skill. Our results open possibilities for a range of new climate services, including for the transport, energy, water management and insurance sectors.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Community Atmosphere Model, version 4 (CAM4), was released as part of the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4). The finite volume (FV) dynamical core is now the default because of its superior transport and conservation properties. Deep convection parameterization changes include a dilute plume calculation of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the introduction of convective momentum transport (CMT). An additional cloud fraction calculation is now performed following macrophysical state updates to provide improved thermodynamic consistency. A freeze-drying modification is further made to the cloud fraction calculation in very dry environments (e.g., the Arctic), where cloud fraction and cloud water values were often inconsistent in CAM3. In CAM4 the FV dynamical core further degrades the excessive trade-wind simulation, but reduces zonal stress errors at higher latitudes. Plume dilution alleviates much of the midtropospheric tropical dry biases and reduces the persistent monsoon precipitation biases over the Arabian Peninsula and the southern Indian Ocean. CMT reduces much of the excessive trade-wind biases in eastern ocean basins. CAM4 shows a global reduction in cloud fraction compared to CAM3, primarily as a result of the freeze-drying and improved cloud fraction equilibrium modifications. Regional climate feature improvements include the propagation of stationary waves from the Pacific into midlatitudes and the seasonal frequency of Northern Hemisphere blocking events. A 1° versus 2° horizontal resolution of the FV dynamical core exhibits superior improvements in regional climate features of precipitation and surface stress. Improvements in the fully coupled mean climate between CAM3 and CAM4 are also more substantial than in forced sea surface temperature (SST) simulations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The estimated increase of observed global ocean heat content (over the depth range from 0 to 3000 meters) between the 1950s and 1990s is at least one order of magnitude larger than the increase in heat content of any other component. Simulation results using an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model that includes estimates of the radiative effects of observed temporal variations in greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols, solar irradiance, and volcanic aerosols over the past century agree with our observation-based estimate of the increase in ocean heat content. The results we present suggest that the observed increase in ocean heat content may largely be due to the increase of anthropogenic gases in Earth's atmosphere.},

abstract = {The analysis of the interannual variability of the
South American monsoon rainfall is carried out
separately for austral spring and summer (and for
November and January), based on a 40-yr station
gauge dataset. Relationships between modes of
variability in these seasons show the influence of
antecedent conditions in spring (or November) on the
evolution of the monsoon rainfall in peak summer (or
January). In spring the first mode is dipolelike,
with opposite loadings over central-eastern and
southeastern South America. It is connected with
ENSO. The second mode shows the highest loadings
slightly south of the South Atlantic convergence
zone. The leading mode of summer also features
dipolelike oscillations between central-eastern and
southeastern South America, but is not strongly
connected with ENSO. The second mode represents the
impact of ENSO, and the third is modulated by SST
anomalies in the southern tropical Atlantic.
Significant relationships are disclosed between the
first dipolelike modes of spring and summer rainfall
and thus between the rainfall in spring and summer
over central-eastern South America, which includes
part of the monsoon core region. These dipolelike
modes are associated with a rotational anomaly over
southeast Brazil that either conveys moisture flux
into central-eastern Brazil (if it is cyclonic) or
into southeastern South America (if it is
anticyclonic). In spring this anomaly seems to be
remotely forced, but after strong rainfall anomalies
over central-eastern Brazil in spring, it tends to
reverse sign in peak summer, inverting the
dipolelike rainfall anomalies. This reversal is
hypothesized to be locally forced by
surface-atmosphere feedback triggered by the spring
anomalies, as weaker teleconnections in summer allow
local processes that are stronger in summer to
overcome remote forcing. SST and circulation
anomalies associated with the first modes in spring
and summer, and also the relationship between the
first summer mode and surface temperature in spring,
are consistent with that hypothesis.},

@article{ramanathan05_brown_clouds,
abstract = {South Asian emissions of fossil fuel SO2 and black
carbon increased≈6-fold since 1930, resulting in
large atmospheric concentrations of black carbon and
other aerosols. This period also witnessed strong
negative trends of surface solar radiation, surface
evaporation, and summer monsoon rainfall. These
changes over India were accompanied by an increase
in atmospheric stability and a decrease in sea
surface temperature gradients in the Northern Indian
Ocean. We conducted an ensemble of coupled
ocean-atmosphere simulations from 1930 to 2000 to
understand the role of atmospheric brown clouds in
the observed trends. The simulations adopt the
aerosol radiative forcing from the Indian Ocean
experiment observations and also account for global
increases in greenhouse gases and sulfate
aerosols. The simulated decreases in surface solar
radiation, changes in surface and atmospheric
temperatures over land and sea, and decreases in
monsoon rainfall are similar to the observed
trends. We also show that greenhouse gases and
sulfates, by themselves, do not account for the
magnitude or even the sign in many instances, of the
observed trends. Thus, our simulations suggest that
absorbing aerosols in atmospheric brown clouds may
have played a major role in the observed regional
climate and hydrological cycle changes and have
masked as much as 50{\%} of the surface warming due to
the global increase in greenhouse gases. The
simulations also raise the possibility that, if
current trends in emissions continue, the
subcontinent may experience a doubling of the
drought frequency in the coming decades.},

abstract = {This paper examines the trajectories followed by intense intrusions of moist air into the Arctic polar region during autumn and winter and their impact on local temperature and sea ice concentration. It is found that the vertical structure of the warming associated with moist intrusions is bottom amplified, corresponding to a transition of local conditions from a "cold clear" state with a strong inversion to a "warm opaque" state with a weaker inversion. In the marginal sea ice zone of the Barents Sea, the passage of an intrusion also causes a retreat of the ice margin, which persists for many days after the intrusion has passed. The authors find that there is a positive trend in the number of intrusion events crossing 70°N during December and January that can explain roughly 45{\%} of the surface air temperature and 30{\%} of the sea ice concentration trends observed in the Barents Sea during the past two decades.},

abstract = {This article describes a historical archive of proxy
and actual precipitation data that extends the
African climate record back to the early nineteenth
century. The 'proxy' archive includes verbal,
documentary references which contain information
related to rainfall conditions, such as references
to famine, drought, agriculture or the nature of the
rainy season. The precipitation archive includes all
observations made in Africa during the nineteenth
century. It consists of records for 60 stations in
Algeria, 87 stations in South Africa and 304
stations scattered over the rest of
Africa. Information is particularly plentiful for
the 1880s and 1890s. The two parts have been be
combined into a semi-quantitative regional data set
indicating annual rainfall conditions in terms of
anomaly classes (e.g., normal, dry, wet). This data
set extends from the early nineteenth century to
1900 and distinguishes seven anomaly classes, using
numbers ranging from -3 to +3 to represent very wet,
wet, good rains, normal, dry, drought, and severe
drought. The regionalization is based on 90
geographical regions shown via studies of the modern
precipitation record to be climatically homogeneous
with respect to the interannual variability of
rainfall. The regional aggregation allows the
voluminous fragmentary information available in
historical sources to be used systematically to
produce multi-year time series that can be directly
integrated into the modern record for each
region. The resultant time series can also be
subjected to statistical analysis, in order to
investigate nineteenth century climate over
Africa. Spatial detail is added to the data set by
utilizing a unique methodology based on climatic
teleconnections established from studies of rainfall
variability over Africa. The historical information
and station records have been combined into a file
containing a regional anomaly value for up to 90
geographic regions and the years 1801-1900. Gaps
necessarily remain in the matrix, but as early as
the 1820s over 40 regions are represented. By the
1880s generally around 70 regions or more are
represented.},

abstract = {Interactions between the tropical oceans and
atmosphere permit a spectrum of natural modes of
oscillation whose properties-period, intensity,
spatial structure, and direction of
propagation-depend on the background climatic state
(i.e., the mean state). This mean state can be
described by parameters that include the following:
the time-averaged intensify tau of the Pacific trade
winds, the mean depth (H) of the thermocline, and
the temperature difference across the thermocline
(DeltaT). A stability analysis by means of a simple
coupled ocean-atmosphere model indicates two
distinct families of unstable modes. One has long
periods of several years, involves sea surface
temperature variations determined by vertical
movements of the thermocline that are part of the
adjustment of the ocean basin to the fluctuating
winds, requires a relatively deep thermocline, and
corresponds to the delayed oscillator. The other
family requires a shallow thermocline, has short
periods of a year or two, has sea surface
temperature variations determined by advection and
by entrainment across the thermocline, and is
associated with westward phase propagation. For the
modes to be unstable, both families require that the
background zonal wind exceed a certain intensity. An
increase in DeltaT, and in H beyond a certain value,
are stabilizing. For intermediate values of H,
between large values that favor the one mode and
small values that favor the other, the modes are of
a hybrid type with some properties of each
family. The observed Southern Oscillation has been
of this type for the past few decades, but some
paleorecords suggest that, in the distant past, the
oscillation was strictly of the delayed oscillator
type and had a very long period on the order of a
decade.},

abstract = {In data-sparse regions such as the Arctic, atmospheric reanalysis is one of the key tools for understanding rapid climate change at the regional and global scales. The utility of reanalysis datasets based on data assimilation is affected by their accuracy and biases. Therefore, it is important to evaluate their performance. Here, we conduct inter-comparisons of two temperature variables, namely, the 2-m air temperature (Ta) and the surface temperature (Ts), from the widely used ERA-I and ERA5 reanalysis datasets provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) against in situ observations from three international buoy programs (i.e., the International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP), the Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC), and the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL)) during 2010–2020 in the Arctic. Overall, the results show that both the ERA-I and ERA5 were well correlated with the buoy observations, with the highest correlation coefficient reaching 0.98. There were generally warm Ta biases for both ERA-I (2.27 ± 3.33◦C) and ERA5 (2.34 ± 3.22◦C) when compared with more than 3000 matching pairs of daily buoy observations. The warm Ta biases of both reanalysis datasets exhibited seasonal variations, reaching the maximum of 3.73 ± 2.84◦C in April and the minimum of 1.36 ± 2.51◦C in September. For Ts, both ERA-I and ERA5 exhibited good consistencies with the buoy observations, but have higher amplitude biases compared with those for Ta, with generally negative biases of −4.79 ± 4.86◦C for ERA-I and −4.11 ± 3.92◦C for ERA5. For both reanalysis datasets, the largest bias of Ts (−11.18 ± 3.08◦C) occurred in December, while the biases were rather small (less than −3◦C) in the warmer months (April to October). The cold Ts biases for ERA-I and ERA5 were probably overestimated due to the location of the surface temperature sensors on the buoys, which may have been affected by snow cover. Both the Ta and Ts biases varied for different buoy programs and different sea ice concentration conditions, yet they exhibited similar trends.},

abstract = {A physically based conceptual framework is put
forward that explains why an increase in heavy
precipitation events should be a primary
manifestation of the climate change that accompanies
increases in greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere. Increased concentrations of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere increase downwelling
infrared radiation, and this global heating at the
surface not only acts to increase temperatures but
also increases evaporation which enhances the
atmospheric moisture content. Consequently all
weather systems, ranging from individual clouds and
thunderstorms to extratropical cyclones, which feed
on the available moisture through storm-scale
moisture convergence, are likely to produce
correspondingly enhanced precipitation
rates. Increases in heavy rainfall at the expense of
more moderate rainfall are the consequence along
with increased runoff and risk of flooding. However,
because of constraints in the surface energy budget,
there are also implications for the frequency and/or
efficiency of precipitation. It follows that
increased attention should be given to trends in
atmospheric moisture content, and datasets on hourly
precipitation rates and frequency need to be
developed and analyzed as well as total
accumulation.},

abstract = {The effect of air-sea coupling on tropical climate
variability is investigated in a coupled linear
inverse model (LIM) derived from the simultaneous
and 6-day lag covariances of observed 7-day running
mean departures from the annual cycle. The model
predicts the covariances at all other lags. The
predicted and observed lag covariances, as well as
the associated power spectra, are generally found to
agree within sampling uncertainty. This validates
the LIM's basic premise that beyond daily time
scales, the evolution of tropical atmospheric and
oceanic anomalies is effectively linear and
stochastically driven. It also justifies a linear
diagnosis of air-sea coupling in the system. The
results show that air-sea coupling has a very small
effect on subseasonal atmospheric variability. It
has much larger effects on longer-term variability,
in both the atmosphere and the ocean, including
greatly increasing the amplitude of ENSO and
lengthening its dominant period from 2 to 4
years. Consistent with these results, the
eigenvectors of the system's dynamical evolution
operator also separate into two distinct, but
nonorthogonal, subspaces: one governing the nearly
uncoupled subseasonal dynamics and the other
governing the strongly coupled longer-term
dynamics. These subspaces arise naturally from the
LIM analysis; no bandpass frequency filtering need
be applied. One implication of this remarkably clean
separation of the uncoupled and coupled dynamics is
that GCM errors in anomalous tropical air-sea
coupling may cause substantial errors on interannual
and longer time scales but probably not on the
subseasonal scales associated with the MJO.},

abstract = {Analyses of proxy based reconstructions of surface temperatures during the past 330 years show the existence of a distinct oscillatory mode of variability with an approximate time scale of 70 years. This variability is also seen in instrumental records, although the oscillatory nature of the variability is difficult to assess due to the short length of the instrumental record. The spatial pattern of this variability is hemispheric or perhaps even global in scale, but with particular emphasis on the Atlantic region. Independent analyses of multicentury integrations of two versions of the GFDL coupled atmosphere-ocean model also show the existence of distinct multidecadal variability in the North Atlantic region which resembles the observed pattern. The model variability involves fluctuations in the intensity of the thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic. It is our intent here to provide a direct comparison of the observed variability to that simulated in a coupled ocean-atmosphere model, making use of both existing instrumental analyses and newly available proxy based multi-century surface temperature estimates. The analyses demonstrate a substantial agreement between the simulated and observed patterns of multidecadal variability in sea surface temperature (SST) over the North Atlantic. There is much less agreement between the model and observations for sea level pressure. Seasonal analyses of the variability demonstrate that for both the model and observations SST appears to be the primary carrier of the multidecadal signal.},

abstract = {It is not known how global warming will affect the
El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The
instrumental record is too short to discern
centennial-scale trends and modelling results are
inconclusive(1-5). Proxy reconstructions indicate
that ENSO activity was relatively high during the
late twentieth century(6-10), but whether this was
unusual in the millennial context remains
uncertain. Here we present insight's into these
issues derived from rings of the kauri tree (Agathis
australis), a rare long-lived conifer endemic to the
forests of northern New Zealand. Our results
indicate that the twentieth century was the most
'ENSO-active' century of the past 500 years, but may
not be unique in the context of the past 700 years,
and that ENSO activity comparable to or elevated
above that experienced during the late twentieth
century is plausible under warmer-than-present
conditions. We also find evidence that there may
have been significant changes in the ENSO
teleconnection to the New Zealand region during the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and of
multi-decadal fluctuations in ENSO-related activity
building up to the present day. Although these two
features may delay the expression of increased ENSO
activity in the New Zealand region, our results
indicate that New Zealand climate is likely to be
more dominated by ENSO-related inter-annual
variability as the world continues to warm.},

abstract = {This paper outlines the development of
regional-scale peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch]
phenology models for the southeastern United
States. We constructed regression-based models to
predict full bloom and first harvest using
phenological data for eight peach cultivars grown in
Georgia, South Carolina, and Texas and
meteorological data from nearby cooperative weather
stations. The mean absolute error (MAE, absolute
value of predicted date minus observed date) of the
all-cultivar full bloom model was 3.48 days. Bloom
model errors were roughly 6 to 7 days (or less) 90{\%}
of the time, while comparable natural bloom date
variability at a single station is about 12 to 13
days. Only two cultivars ('Dixired' and 'Elberta')
had first harvest models with 90{\%} error thresholds
at or less than the natural harvest date variability
at a single station (9 to 10 days). Thus, first
harvest appears to be less predictable than full
bloom, at least in terms of the temperature
variables used in this study. The bloom model could
serve as a prognostic tool, while the two cultivar
harvest models are appropriate only for diagnostic
studies, such as evaluating the potential response
of a peach cultivar in a new location. The appeal of
the models is that they consider numerous cultivars
over a wide region and they use readily available
meteorological data.},

abstract = {Regulation of interannual phenological variability
is an important component of climate and ecological
models. Prior phenological efforts using the
advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) as
a proxy of vegetation dynamics have often simulated
spring events only or failed to simulate interannual
variability. Our aim is to address these
shortcomings and to use the AVHRR to develop
prognostic models for interannual land surface
phenology and, critically, to test whether or not
the developed models are superior to use of
climatological phenology values from the
AVHRR. Using datasets for the conterminous United
States, we first filtered data to select regions and
plant functional types for which the best-possible
remotely sensed signal could be obtained. We then
used a generalized linear model approach to model
the relationship between an integrative productivity
index and estimates of the start of season (SOS) and
end of season (EOS) derived from the AVHRR, yielding
models capable of prognostically predicting SOS/EOS
events independently of satellite data. Mean
absolute errors between the model-predicted and
AVHRR-observed SOS/EOS ranged from 5.1 to 20.3
days. SOS errors were uniformly lower than EOS
errors. SOS models for the deciduous broadleaf
forest and grassland plant functional types produced
lower errors than use of the climatological SOS
values while all other models produced errors higher
than those obtained from the climatological
dates. Based on this criterion for success, we
suggest that the AVHRR may not be appropriate for
further development of prognostic land surface
phenology models. However, an intercomparison of
phenological dates from an independent spring index
model, our model predictions, and the AVHRR
observations indicated that interannual predictions
from our models may be superior to the satellite
data upon which they are based, implying that a
further comparison between models based on the AVHRR
and newer, superior sensors, should be
conducted. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights

in the United States have been faithfully recorded
in the reconstructions even though the method of
reconstruction is not explicitly spatial in its
design. The drought reconstructions show that the
1930s "Dust Bowl" drought was the most severe such
event to strike the United States since 1700. Other
more local droughts are also revealed in the

abstract = {The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of the zonal mean wind is a prominent feature of the tropical lower stratosphere and has been shown to influence stratospheric and tropospheric variability. Although observed for many decades, the QBO is difficult to be accurately captured in Earth system models. The newly developed U.S. Department of Energy Energy Exascale Earth System Model, Version 1 (E3SMv1) is capable of resolving stratospheric dynamics as it has a top at 0.1 hPa and 72 levels. The tropical oscillation of the zonal mean zonal wind in the default version of the model is too fast and too strong compared to the observed QBO. Here we evaluate the current simulation of the QBO and present simulations with modified convective gravity wave parameterization parameters that make the oscillation more realistic, especially in terms of the period. Although improvements in the QBO are obtained through modifications to the parameterized gravity waves, we find that the forcing of the QBO from Kelvin and mixed-Rossby gravity waves is small due to weak sources in the troposphere. The changes to the parameterized convective gravity waves (and QBO) are primarily limited to the tropical stratosphere. Small changes to mean wind and temperature are also found in Northern Hemisphere winter in the uppermost troposphere between 10°N and 60°N. Modifications to parameterized convectively generated gravity waves result in changes in interannual variability, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, and modest changes in sea level pressure variability over the Pacific are also noted.},

abstract = {Arctic permafrost stores nearly 1,700 billion metric tons of frozen and thawing carbon. Anthropogenic warming threatens to release an unknown quantity of this carbon to the atmosphere, influencing the climate in processes collectively known as the permafrost carbon feedback. In this Review, we discuss advances in tracking permafrost carbon dynamics, including mechanisms of abrupt thaw, instrumental observations of carbon release and model predictions of the permafrost carbon feedback. Abrupt thaw and thermokarst could emit a substantial amount of carbon to the atmosphere rapidly (days to years), mobilizing the deep legacy carbon sequestered in Yedoma. Carbon dioxide emissions are proportionally larger than other greenhouse gas emissions in the Arctic, but expansion of anoxic conditions within thawed permafrost and soils stands to increase the proportion of future methane emissions. Increasingly frequent wildfires in the Arctic will also lead to a notable but unpredictable carbon flux. More detailed monitoring though in situ, airborne and satellite observations will provide a deeper understanding of the Arctic's future role as a carbon source or sink, and the subsequent impact on the Earth system. Large stores of carbon could be released to the atmosphere from Arctic warming, driving permafrost thaw. This Review examines the processes that impact Arctic permafrost carbon emissions, how they might change in the future and ways to monitor and predict these changes.},

abstract = {Present estimates of the future oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 and calculations of CO2-emission scenarios1 are based on the assumption that the natural carbon cycle is in steady state. But it iswell known from palaeoclimate records2, 3, 4, 5 and modelling studies6, 7, 8, 9 that the climate system has more than one equilibrium state, and that perturbations can trigger transitions between them. Anticipated future changes in today's climate system due to human activities have the potential to weaken the thermohaline circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean10, 11, 12, which would greatly modify estimates of future oceanic CO2 uptake13. Here we use a simple coupled atmosphere–ocean climate model to show that the Atlantic thermohaline circulation is not only sensitive to the final atmospheric CO2 concentration attained, but also depends on the rate of change of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. A modelled increase to 750 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.) CO2 within 100 years (corresponding approximately to a continuation of today's growth rate) leads to a permanent shut-down of the thermohaline circulation. If the final atmospheric concentration of 750 p.p.m.v. CO2 is attained more slowly, the thermohaline circulation simply slows down. The reason for this rate-sensitive response of the climate system lies with the transfer of buoyancy in the form of heat and fresh water from the uppermost layers of the ocean into the deep waters below. This sensitivity of the simulated thermohaline circulation to the rate ofchange of atmospheric CO2 concentration has potentially important implications for the choice of future CO2-emission scenarios1.},

One limitation of that recent study was the relatively small number of hybrid zones available for mapping. In this study, we search for evidence of clustering of contact zones between closely related taxa using data not only from hybrid zones but from species range maps of trees, birds, and mammals and from the position of phylogeographic breaks within species. Digital geographic range maps and a geographic information system approach allowed for accurate and rapid mapping of distributional data. Areas of contact between closely related species and phylogeographic breaks within species clustered into areas characterized by common physiographic features or predicted by previously hypothesized glacial refugia. The results underscore the general importance of geographic barriers to dispersal (mountain chains) and climate change (periods of cooling alternating with periods of warming, which lead to the contraction and expansion of species ranges) in species evolution.},

abstract = {The surface temperature response to greenhouse gas forcing displays a characteristic pattern of polar-amplified warming1–5, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. However, the causes of this polar amplification are still debated. Some studies highlight the importance of surface-albedo feedback6–8, while others find larger contributions from longwave feedbacks4,9,10, with changes in atmospheric and oceanic heat transport also thought to play a role11–16. Here, we determine the causes of polar amplification using climate model simulations in which CO2 forcing is prescribed in distinct geographical regions, with the linear sum of climate responses to regional forcings replicating the response to global forcing. The degree of polar amplification depends strongly on the location of CO2 forcing. In particular, polar amplification is found to be dominated by forcing in the polar regions, specifically through positive local lapse-rate feedback, with ice-albedo and Planck feedbacks playing subsidiary roles. Extra-polar forcing is further shown to be conducive to polar warming, but given that it induces a largely uniform warming pattern through enhanced poleward heat transport, it contributes little to polar amplification. Therefore, understanding polar amplification requires primarily a better insight into local forcing and feedbacks rather than extra-polar processes.},

Warmer spring temperatures coupled$\backslash$nwith increases in mean and variance of spring$\backslash$nprecipitation correspond strongly to earlier$\backslash$nsnowmeltout, an increased number of snow-free days,$\backslash$nand observed changes in streamflow timing and$\backslash$ndischarge. The majority of the variability in peak$\backslash$nand total annual snowpack and streamflow, however,$\backslash$nis explained by season-dependent$\backslash$ninterannual-to-interdecadal changes in atmospheric$\backslash$ncirculation associated with Pacific Ocean sea$\backslash$nsurface temperatures.

abstract = {This study investigates the influence of atmospheric initial conditions on winter seasonal forecasts of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Hindcast (or reforecast) experiments – which differ only in their initial conditions – are performed over the period 1960–2009, using prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) and sea-ice boundary conditions. The first experiment (“ERA-40/Int IC”) is initialized using the ERA-40 and ERA-Interim reanalysis datasets, which assimilate upper-air, satellite and surface observations; the second experiment (“ERA-20C IC”) is initialized using the ERA-20C reanalysis dataset, which assimilates only surface observations. The ensemble mean NAO skill is largest in ERA-40/Int IC (r = 0.54), which is initialized with the superior reanalysis data. Moreover, ERA-20C IC did not exhibit significantly more NAO hindcast skill (r = 0.38) than in a third experiment, which was initialized with incorrect (shuffled) initial conditions. The ERA-40/Interim and ERA-20C initial conditions differ substantially in the tropical stratosphere, where the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of zonal winds is not present in ERA-20C. The QBO hindcasts are highly skilful in ERA-40/Int IC – albeit with a somewhat weaker equatorial zonal wind amplitude in the lower stratosphere – but are incorrect in ERA-20C IC, indicating that the QBO is responsible for the additional NAO hindcast skill; this is despite the model exhibiting a relatively weak teleconnection between the QBO and NAO. The influence of the QBO is further demonstrated by regressing out the QBO influence from each of the hindcast experiments, after which the difference in NAO hindcast skill between the experiments is negligible. Whilst ERA-40/Int IC demonstrates a more skilful NAO hindcast, it appears to have a relatively weak predictable signal; this is the so-called “signal-to-noise paradox” identified in previous studies. Diagnostically amplifying the (weak) QBO–NAO teleconnection increases the ensemble-mean NAO signal with negligible impact on the NAO hindcast skill, after which the signal-to-noise problem seemingly disappears.},

This dataset is derived from daily interpolated meteorological data, and results are compared with historical station data to ensure the trends and variations are robust. Regional trends in the first leaf index range from –0.8 to –1.6 days per decade, while first bloom index trends are between –0.4 and –1.2 for most regions.

@article{harnik10,
abstract = {The midlatitude response to tropical Pacific SST
anomalies involves changes in transient eddy
propagation, but the processes leading to the
transient eddy changes are still not clear. In a
recent study, we used a series of controlled general
circulation model (GCM) experiments in which an
imposed tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature
(SST) anomaly is turned on abruptly and the response
is analyzed in terms of its high-and low-frequency
parts, to show that the changes in transient eddies
induced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) arise
from changes in wave refraction on the altered mean
flow. In this work, we use a quasi-geostrophic
linear model and a linear stationary wave model, to
interpret the GCM experiments and obtain the
sequence of events that lead from a tropical SST
anomaly to the quasi-equilibrium change in the mean
and transient atmospheric circulation. The initial
direct response of the mean flow is confined to the
tropical and subtropical Pacific, similar to what is
obtained from a stationary wave model. This
tropical-subtropical mean flow change initiates a
transient eddy response, which induces a midlatitude
mean flow anomaly. The wave-mean flow system evolves
towards a state in which the eddy anomalies maintain
the mean flow anomalies, allowing them to
persist. It is further shown that, while eddy
momentum fluxes persistently accelerate and
decelerate the subtropical and midlatitude mean
flow, the eddy heat flux effect on the zonal mean
flow is much more variable, and only marginally
significant. The linear quasi-geostrophic model
calculations capture the evolution of eddy momentum
flux anomalies equatorwards of 60 degrees N quite
well, suggesting linear wave refraction can explain
the midlatitude ENSO anomalies. However, other
processes, like stationary waves or changes in the
nonlinear stage of eddy life cycles, are needed to
explain the ENSO-related anomalies at high
latitudes, polewards of around 60 degrees

abstract = {The approximately century-long instrumental record of precipitation over land reflects a single sampling of internal variability. Thus, the spatiotemporal evolution of the observations is only one realization of what could have occurred given the same climate system and boundary conditions but different initial conditions.While climate models can be used to produce initial-condition large ensembles that explicitly sample different sequences of internal variability, an analogous approach is not possible for the real world. Here, we explore the use of a statistical model for monthly precipitation to generate synthetic ensembles based on a single record. When tested within the context of the NCAR Community Earth System Model version 1 Large Ensemble (CESM1-LE), we find that the synthetic ensemble can closely reproduce the spatiotemporal statistics of variability and trends in winter precipitation over the extended contiguous United States and that it is difficult to infer the climate change signal in a single record given the magnitude of the variability.We additionally create a synthetic ensemble based on the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) dataset, termed the GPCC-synth-LE; comparison of the GPCC-synth-LE with the CESM1-based ensembles reveals differences in the spatial structures and magnitudes of variability, highlighting the advantages of an observationally based ensemble.We finally use the GPCC-synth-LE to analyze three water resource metrics in the upper Colorado River basin: frequency of dry, wet, and whiplash years. Thirty-one-year climatologies in the GPCC-synth-LE can differ by over 20{\%} in these key water resource metrics due to sampling of internal variability, and individual ensemble members in the GPCC-synth-LE can exhibit large near-monotonic trends over the course of the last century due to sampling of internal variability alone.},

Here I present a review of indices and patterns of decadal climate variability in the Pacific from observations and palaeoclimate reconstructions. I examine the spatial characteristics of Pacific sea surface temperature variability and the metrics used to track observations of PDV. I find commonalities between the PDV patterns, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and its North and South Pacific counterparts, the Pacific Decadal and South Pacific Decadal Oscillations (PDO and SPDO). I present a tool to provide probabilistic quantification of the recent state of the IPO, and use the tool to provide reliable estimates of IPO state up to 2 years prior to the present. The tool indicates a probability of 80–90{\%} that the IPO remained in its negative state until 2014–2015. I review palaeoclimate reconstructions of the IPO and PDO, and outline advances and challenges in our pre-instrumental understanding of PDV. I draw attention to a Pacific-wide tropical-extratropical mechanism that suggests that the cool and warm phases of PDV are not driven by tropical or extratropical variability alone, but are instead the result of continuous tropical-extratropical interactions on decadal timescales. I conclude by noting key sources of remaining uncertainty and emphasising the need to better understand decadal variability. This will occur through continual improvements in observations, an expansion of palaeoclimate exploration and data collection, and renewed efforts in model development.},

abstract = {Rapid Arctic warming and sea-ice reduction in the Arctic Ocean are widely attributed to anthropogenic climate change. The Arctic warming exceeds the global average warming because of feedbacks that include sea-ice reduction and other dynamical and radiative feedbacks. We find that the most prominent annual mean surface and tropospheric warming in the Arctic since 1979 has occurred in northeastern Canada and Greenland. In this region, much of the year-to-year temperature variability is associated with the leading mode of large-scale circulation variability in the North Atlantic, namely, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Here we show that the recent warming in this region is strongly associated with a negative trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation, which is a response to anomalous Rossby wave-train activity originating in the tropical Pacific. Atmospheric model experiments forced by prescribed tropical sea surface temperatures simulate the observed circulation changes and associated tropospheric and surface warming over northeastern Canada and Greenland. Experiments from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (ref. 16) models with prescribed anthropogenic forcing show no similar circulation changes related to the North Atlantic Oscillation or associated tropospheric warming. This suggests that a substantial portion of recent warming in the northeastern Canada and Greenland sector of the Arctic arises from unforced natural variability.},

SST forcing patterns include a global pattern
similar to the background warming trend, a pattern
in the Pacific, and a pattern in the Atlantic. Five
different global atmospheric models were forced by
fixed SSTs to test the impact of these SST anomalies
on droughts and pluvials relative to a
climatologically forced control run. The five
models generally yield similar results in the
locations of drought and pluvial frequency changes
throughout the annual cycle in response to each
given SST pattern. In all of the simulations, areas
with an increase in the mean drought (pluvial)

frequency of drought (pluvial) events.
Additionally, areas with more frequent extreme
events also tend to show higher intensity
extremes. The cold Pacific anomaly increases drought

Atlantic anomaly increases drought occurrence in

However, it is largely unknown how Arctic summer sea-ice impacts would vary under the 1.5 °C Paris target compared to scenarios with greater warming. Using the Community Earth System Model, I show that constraining warming to 1.5 °C rather than 2.0 °C reduces the probability of any summer ice-free conditions by 2100 from 100{\%} to 30{\%}. It also reduces the late-century probability of an ice cover below the 2012 record minimum from 98{\%} to 55{\%}. For warming above 2 °C, frequent ice-free conditions can be expected, potentially for several months per year. Although sea-ice loss is generally reversible for decreasing temperatures, sea ice will only recover to current conditions if atmospheric CO2 is reduced below present-day concentrations. Due to model biases, these results provide a lower bound on summer sea-ice impacts, but clearly demonstrate the benefits of constraining warming to 1.5 °C.},

The visual design (defined in this study as the method, technique, and style used to create a visual) directly affects perception and yet, we know very little about how people intuitively respond to visuals depicting climate science. This study examines the perception of four images from the IPCC summary report for policymakers and two open sourced infographics. Using a group-administered study we found the visual design to have a significant impact on a novice readers ability to associate relevant words with an image. While the visuals part of the summary for policymakers educed a sense of confidence, a well-designed infographic left readers feeling less confident. The veneer of legitimacy associated with IPCC visuals is because they look scientific, whereas infographic images were found to look less serious. We acknowledge the accessibility of an infographic but urge IPCC authors to use it with caution, as any negative impact on scientific credibility is an unwanted feature in IPCC communication.},

abstract = {The potential role of solar variations in modulating
recent climate has been debated for many decades and
recent papers suggest that solar forcing may be less
than previously believed. Because solar variability
before the satellite period must be scaled from
proxy data, large uncertainty exists about phase and
magnitude of the forcing. We used a coupled climate
system model to determine whether proxy-based
irradiance series are capable of inducing climatic
variations that resemble variations found in climate
reconstructions, and if part of the previously
estimated large range of past solar irradiance
changes could be excluded. Transient simulations,
covering the published range of solar irradiance
estimates, were integrated from 850 AD to the
present. Solar forcing as well as volcanic and
anthropogenic forcing are detectable in the model
results despite internal variability. The resulting
climates are generally consistent with temperature
reconstructions. Smaller, rather than larger,
long-term trends in solar irradiance appear more
plausible and produced modeled climates in better
agreement with the range of Northern Hemisphere
temperature proxy records both with respect to phase
and magnitude. Despite the direct response of the
model to solar forcing, even large solar irradiance
change combined with realistic volcanic forcing over
past centuries could not explain the late 20th
century warming without inclusion of greenhouse gas
forcing. Although solar and volcanic effects appear
to dominate most of the slow climate variations
within the past thousand years, the impacts of
greenhouse gases have dominated since the second
half of the last century.},

abstract = {The indirect effect of winter Arctic Oscillation (AO) events on the proceeding summer Arctic sea ice extent suggests an inherent winter-to-summer mechanism for sea ice predictability. On the other hand, operational regional summer sea ice forecasts in a large number of coupled climate models show a considerable drop in predictive skill for forecasts initialised prior to the date of melt onset in spring, suggesting that some drivers of sea ice variability on longer time scales may not be well represented in these models. To this end, we introduce an unsupervised learning approach based on cluster analysis 5 and complex networks to establish how well the latest generation of coupled climate models participating in phase 6 of the World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) are able to reflect the spatio-temporal patterns of variability in northern-hemisphere winter sea-level pressure and Arctic summer sea ice concentration over the period 1979-2020, relative to ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis and satellite-derived sea ice observations respectively. Two specific global metrics are introduced as ways to compare patterns of variability between models and observations/reanalysis: the Adjusted 10 Rand Index-a method for comparing spatial patterns of variability, and a network distance metric-a method for comparing the degree of connectivity between two geographic regions. We find that CMIP6 models generally reflect the spatial pattern of variability of the AO relatively well, although overestimate the magnitude of sea-level pressure variability over the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and underestimate the variability over the north Africa and southern Europe. They also underestimate the importance of regions such as the Beaufort, East Siberian and Laptev seas in explaining pan-Arctic summer sea ice area 15 variability, which we hypothesise is due to regional biases in sea ice thickness. Finally, observations show that historically, winter AO events (negatively) covary strongly with summer sea ice concentration in the eastern Pacific sector of the Arctic, although now under a thinning ice regime, both the eastern and western Pacific sectors exhibit similar behaviour. CMIP6 models however do not show this transition on average, which may hinder their ability to make skilful seasonal to inter-annual predictions of summer sea ice. 20 1 https://doi.},

abstract = {Weather and climate variations on subseasonal to decadal time scales can have enormous social, economic, and environmental impacts, making skillful predictions on these time scales a valuable tool for decision-makers. As such, there is a growing interest in the scientific, operational, and applications communities in developing forecasts to improve our foreknowledge of extreme events. On subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scales, these include high-impact meteorological events such as tropical cyclones, extratropical storms, floods, droughts, and heat and cold waves. On seasonal to decadal (S2D) time scales, while the focus broadly remains similar (e.g., on precipitation, surface and upper-ocean temperatures, and their effects on the probabilities of high-impact meteorological events), understanding the roles of internal variability and externally forced variability such as anthropogenic warming in forecasts also becomes important. The S2S and S2D communities share common scientific and technical challenges. These include forecast initialization and ensemble generation; initialization shock and drift; understanding the onset of model systematic errors; bias correction, calibration, and forecast quality assessment; model resolution; atmosphere-ocean coupling; sources and expectations for predictability; and linking research, operational forecasting, and end-user needs. In September 2018 a coordinated pair of international conferences, framed by the above challenges, was organized jointly by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the World Weather Research Programme (WWRP). These conferences surveyed the state of S2S and S2D prediction, ongoing research, and future needs, providing an ideal basis for synthesizing current and emerging developments in these areas that promise to enhance future operational services.

The emergence of observed temperature changes over both land and ocean is clearest in tropical regions, in contrast to the regions of largest change which are in the northern extratropics—broadly consistent with climate model simulations.

abstract = {Time of emergence of anthropogenic climate change is a crucial metric in risk assessments surrounding future climate predictions. However, internal climate variability impairs the ability to make accurate statements about when climate change emerges from a background reference state. None of the existing efforts to explore uncertainties in time of emergence has explicitly explored the role of internal atmospheric circulation variability. Here a dynamical adjustment method based on constructed circulation analogs is used to provide new estimates of time of emergence of anthropogenic warming over North America and Europe from both a local and spatially aggregated perspective. After removing the effects of internal atmospheric circulation variability, the emergence of anthropogenic warming occurs on average two decades earlier in winter and one decade earlier in summer over North America and Europe. Dynamical adjustment increases the percentage of land area over which warming has emerged by about 30{\%} and 15{\%} in winter (10{\%} and5{\%}in summer) over North America and Europe, respectively. Using a large ensemble of simulations with a climate model, evidence is provided that thermodynamic factors related to variations in snow cover, sea ice, and soil moisture are important drivers of the remaining uncertainty in time of emergence. Model biases in variability lead to an underestimation (13{\%}-22{\%} over North America and {\textless}5{\%} over Europe) of the land fraction emerged by 2010 in summer, indicating that the forced warming signal emerges earlier in observations than suggested by models. The results herein illustrate opportunities for future detection and attribution studies to improve physical understanding by explicitly accounting for internal atmospheric circulation variability.},

The latest suite of CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs) produce a wide range of simulated SIT in the historical period (1979–2014) and exhibit various biases when compared with the Pan-Arctic Ice–Ocean Modelling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) sea ice reanalysis. We present a new method to constrain such GCM simulations of SIT via a statistical bias correction technique. The bias correction successfully constrains the spatial SIT distribution and temporal variability in the CMIP5 projections whilst retaining the climatic fluctuations from individual ensemble members. The bias correction acts to reduce the spread in projections of SIT and reveals the significant contributions of climate internal variability in the first half of the century and of scenario uncertainty from the mid-century onwards. The projected date of ice-free conditions in the Arctic under the RCP8.5 high emission scenario occurs in the 2050s, which is a decade earlier than without the bias correction, with potentially significant implications for stakeholders in the Arctic such as the shipping industry. The bias correction methodology developed could be similarly applied to other variables to reduce spread in climate projections more generally.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The origins of uncertainty in climate projections have major consequences for the scientific and policy decisions made in response to climate change. Internal climate variability, for example, is an inherent uncertainty in the climate system that is undersampled by the multimodel ensembles used in most climate impacts research. Because of this, decision makers are left with the question of whether the range of climate projections across models is due to structural model choices, thus requiring more scientific investment to constrain, or instead is a set of equally plausible outcomes consistent with the same warming world. Similarly, many questions faced by scientists require a clear separation of model uncertainty and that arising from internal variability. With this as motivation and the renewed attention to large ensembles given planning for Phase 7 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP7), we illustrate the scientific and policy value of the attribution and quantification of uncertainty from initial condition large ensembles, particularly when analyzed in conjunction with multimodel ensembles. We focus on how large ensembles can support regional-scale robust adaptation decision-making in ways multimodel ensembles alone cannot. We also acknowledge several recently identified problems associated with large ensembles, namely, that they are (1) resource intensive, (2) redundant, and (3) biased.

abstract = {This study investigates the influence of individuals' social connections in their decision to either evacuate or not evacuate in the days preceding the landfall of Hurricane Irma. Using Hurricane Irma in September 2017 as a case study, a survey was conducted on two groups (those who evacuated and those who did not evacuate) to assess people's social connections specifically examining three dimensions: dependability, density, and diversity. These variables, together with socioeconomic variables (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, education), were considered in order to better explain the influences on evacuation decision-making. To collect accurate ephemeral decision-making data from evacuees, the surveys were completed during the evacuation for those who evacuated and shortly after the passage of Hurricane Irma for those who did not evacuate. Through statistical analyses, it was concluded that density and diversity of people's social networks played a significant role in the decision to evacuate or not, with evacuees having more dense and diverse relationships. On the other hand, the perceived dependability of a person's social connections (i.e., their perceived access to resources and support) did not significantly impact the decision to evacuate for Hurricane Irma. This study has important implications for adding to the knowledge base on community-based sustainable disaster preparedness and resilience.},

abstract = {Climate model ensembles, such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 3 (CMIP3), are used to characterize broadscale ranges of projected regional climate change and their impacts. The 17-member Hadley Centre perturbed physics GCM ensemble [Quantifying Uncertainty in Model Predictions ("QUMP")] extends this capability by including data enabling dynamical downscaling of these ranges, and similar data are now being made available from the CMIP phase 5 (CMIP5) GCMs. These raise new opportunities to provide and apply high-resolution regional climate projections. This study highlights the importance of employing a well-considered sampling strategy from available ensembles to provide scientifically credible information on regional climate change while minimizing the computational complexity of ensemble downscaling. A subset of the QUMP ensemble is selected for a downscaling program in Vietnam using the Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) regional climate modeling system. Multiannual mean fields from each GCM are assessed with a focus on the Asian summer monsoon, given its importance to proposed applications of the projections. First, the study examines whether any model should be eliminated because significant deficiencies in its simulation may render its future climate projections unrealistic. No evidence is found to eliminate any of the 17 GCMs on these grounds. Second, the range of their future projections is explored and five models that best represent the full range of future climates are identified. The subset characterizes the range of both global and regional responses, and patterns of rainfall response, the wettest and driest projections for Vietnam, and different projected Asian summer monsoon changes. How these ranges of responses compare with those in the CMIP3 ensemble are also assessed, finding differences in both the signal and the spread of results in Southeast Asia. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

These three years are the three warmest on record in all but one of the datasets. The largest warming occurred over land, especially at high latitudes. Since the strong El Ni{\~{n}}o event that occurred in 2015/2016 was similar to the 1997/1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o, we compared the 2014–2016 period with 1998, the warmest year in the 20th century. The contribution to the annual mean surface temperature anomaly of climate variations at different time scales was assessed using ensemble empirical mode decomposition. Results based on the HadCRUT4 dataset suggest that the interannual component may have contributed an anomaly of −0.01°C in 2014, 0.12°C in 2015, and 0.06°C in 2016. These values are substantially lower than the contribution in 1998 (0.18°C). In comparison, the combined contribution of the decadal-to-multidecadal (DM) component and the long-term warming trend was 0.64°C in 2014, 0.70°C in 2015, and 0.77°C in 2016, which are substantially greater than that in 1998 (0.41°C). Similar results were obtained using the other four datasets. The larger contribution from the DM component and the long-term warming trend implies that warmer years like 2014–2016 may occur more frequently in the near future. We conclude that the so-called warming hiatus has faded away.},

Presented are skill scores for these seven real-time forecasts and also for 33 winter hindcasts (1972/73–2004/05). The model demonstrates positive skill over much of the eastern United States and northern Eurasia—regions that have eluded skillful predictions among the existing major seasonal forecast centers. Comparison with three leading dynamical forecast systems shows that the statistical model produces superior skill for the same regions.

If the recent methodology of initialized decadal climate prediction could have been applied in the mid-1990s using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 multi-models, both the negative phase of the IPO in the early 2000s as well as the hiatus could have been simulated, with the multi-model average performing better than most of the individual models.

extended hydrologic records from tree-ring

collectively define and examine research and
planning needs, the activities of which are embedded
within wider social and political contexts. These

the potential benefits of reflexive interactions of

The model began as a fork of the well-known Community Atmosphere Model, but it has evolved in new ways, and coding, performance, resolution, physical processes (primarily cloud and aerosols formulations), testing and development procedures now differ significantly. Vertical resolution was increased (from 30 to 72 layers), and the model top extended to 60 km ({\~{}}0.1 hPa). A simple ozone photochemistry predicts stratospheric ozone, and the model now supports increased and more realistic variability in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. An optional improved treatment of light-absorbing particle deposition to snowpack and ice is available, and stronger connections with Earth system biogeochemistry can be used for some science problems. Satellite and ground-based cloud and aerosol simulators were implemented to facilitate evaluation of clouds, aerosols, and aerosol-cloud interactions. Higher horizontal and vertical resolution, increased complexity, and more predicted and transported variables have increased the model computational cost and changed the simulations considerably. These changes required development of alternate strategies for tuning and evaluation as it was not feasible to “brute force” tune the high-resolution configurations, so short-term hindcasts, perturbed parameter ensemble simulations, and regionally refined simulations provided guidance on tuning and parameterization sensitivity to higher resolution. A brief overview of the model and model climate is provided. Model fidelity has generally improved compared to its predecessors and the CMIP5 generation of climate models.},

abstract = {Earth's equator-to-pole temperature gradient drives westerly mid-latitude jet streams through thermal wind balance1. In the upper atmosphere, anthropogenic climate change is strengthening this meridional temperature gradient by cooling the polar lower stratosphere2,3 and warming the tropical upper troposphere4–6, acting to strengthen the upper-level jet stream7. In contrast, in the lower atmosphere, Arctic amplification of global warming is weakening the meridional temperature gradient8–10, acting to weaken the upper-level jet stream. Therefore, trends in the speed of the upper-level jet stream11–13 represent a closely balanced tug-of-war between two competing effects at different altitudes14. It is possible to isolate one of the competing effects by analysing the vertical shear—the change in wind speed with height—instead of the wind speed, but this approach has not previously been taken. Here we show that, although the zonal wind speed in the North Atlantic polar jet stream at 250 hectopascals has not changed since the start of the observational satellite era in 1979, the vertical shear has increased by 15 per cent (with a range of 11–17 per cent) according to three different reanalysis datasets15–17. We further show that this trend is attributable to the thermal wind response to the enhanced upper-level meridional temperature gradient. Our results indicate that climate change may be having a larger impact on the North Atlantic jet stream than previously thought. The increased vertical shear is consistent with the intensification of shear-driven clear-air turbulence expected from climate change18–20, which will affect aviation in the busy transatlantic flight corridor by creating a more turbulent flying environment for aircraft. We conclude that the effects of climate change and variability on the upper-level jet stream are being partly obscured by the traditional focus on wind speed rather than wind shear.},

abstract = {Studies of emergent constraints have frequently proposed that a single metric can constrain future responses of the Earth system to anthropogenic emissions. Here, we illustrate that strong relationships between observables and future climate across an ensemble can arise from common structural model assumptions with few degrees of freedom. Such cases have the potential to produce strong yet overconfident constraints when processes are represented in a common, oversimplified fashion throughout the ensemble. We consider these issues in the context of a collection of published constraints and argue that although emergent constraints are potentially powerful tools for understanding ensemble response variation and relevant observables, their na{\"{i}}ve application to reduce uncertainties in unknown climate responses could lead to bias and overconfidence in constrained projections. The prevalence of this thinking has led to literature in which statements are made on the probability bounds of key climate variables that were confident yet inconsistent between studies. Together with statistical robustness and a mechanism, assessments of climate responses must include multiple lines of evidence to identify biases that can arise from shared, oversimplified modelling assumptions that impact both present and future climate simulations in order to mitigate against the influence of shared structural biases.},

atmospheric reanalyses are examined to argue that
the zonally symmetric component is caused by
interactions between transient eddies and tropical
ly-forced changes in the subtropical jets. During El
Niho events the jets strengthen in each hemisphere
and shift equatorward. Changes in the subtropical
jet influence the transient-eddy momentum fluxes and
the eddy-driven mean meridional circulation. During
El Nino events, eddy-driven ascent in the
midlatitudes of each hemisphere is accompanied by
low-level convergence and brings increased
precipitation. These changes in the transient-eddy

cancel each other and, in Ann, do not contribute to
the zonal-mean precipitation anomalies. Propagation
of anomalous stationary waves disrupts the zonal
symmetry. Flow around the deeper Aleutian Low and
the eastward extension of the Pacific jet stream
supply the moisture for increased precipitation over
the eastern North Pacific and the Western seaboard

decadal components are too weak in several key

abstract = {We measured stable oxygen isotope ratios and
skeletal growth rates in the massive corals Pavona
clavus and P. gigantea from the west coast of
Isabela Island, Galapagos, to assess interannual to
decadal climate variability in the eastern
Pacific. Comparisons of instrumental data sets show
that sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Galapagos
region are representative of a broad portion of the
eastern equatorial Pacific. The site is especially
well-suited for long-term studies of the El
Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, as it
lies within the eastern Pacific ''center of action''
for thermal anomalies associated with ENSO. The
P. gigantea isotope record is nearly monthly in
resolution, spans the period 1961-1982, and shows
strong correlation with a Galapagos instrumental SST
record (r = -0.90 for annual
averages). Cross-spectral analysis shows that SST
can explain greater than 80{\%} of the variance in
deltaO-18 at both the annual cycle and within the
high-frequency portion of the ENSO band (3-5
years). The P. clavus record is annual in
resolution, extends from 1587 to 1953 A.D., and was
obtained from a 10-m diameter colony preserved
within the Urvina Bay uplift. Because seawater
deltaO-18 variations in the region are very small,
we interpret the Urvina Bay coral deltaO-18 record
in terms of annual average SST. The isotopic record
appears to be a very good, but not perfect,
indicator of ENSO events and shows good
correspondence with the historical ENSO
reconstruction of Quinn et al. (1987). A number of
low deltaO-18 excursions that we observe during the
17th and 18th centuries very likely represent ENSO
events that are missing from the historical
tabulations. Most interannual deltaO-18 variations
between 1607 and 1953 A.D. represent annual average
temperature excursions of 1-degrees to
2.5-degrees-C. During the Little Ice Age, the annual
deltaO-18 series correlates well with many North
American tree ring records and shows low
temperatures during the early 1600s and early 1800s,
and relatively warmer conditions during the
1700s. Unlike most northern hemisphere tree ring and
instrumental records, we see no evidence at this
site for warming between 1880 and 1940 but rather
observe a slight cooling ({\textless}1-degrees-C). Oscillatory
modes within the ENSO frequency band dominate the
347-year deltaO-18 time series, accounting for {\textgreater}28{\%}
of the total variance. The main ENSO mode is
centered at 4.6 years and accounts for 12{\%} of the
total variance. Additional significant oscillations
occur at periods of 3.3, 6, 8, 11, 17, 22, and 34
years. Both annual growth rate and deltaO-18 show
variance at periods equivalent to the solar and
solar magnetic periods (e.g., 11 and 22 years,
respectively). In addition, the amplitude of the
11-year deltaO-18 cycle generally varies with the
amplitude of the solar cycle, supporting previous
suggestions that the solar cycle may modulate
interannual to decadal climate variability in the
tropics. The dominant oscillatory modes, both within
the ENSO and interdecadal frequency bands, shift to
shorter periods from the early to middle 1700s and
again from the middle to late 1800s. This may
reflect major reorganizations within the tropical
ocean-atmosphere system and suggests that tropical
Pacific climate variability is linked across
timescales ranging from years to decades.},

When the anticyclones are best developed, during local summer, subsidence and equatorward advection on the eastern flanks of the anticyclones cool SSTs, while poleward flow on the western flanks warms SSTs. During local winter the SST asymmetry across the subtropical North Atlantic and North Pacific is maintained by warm water advection in the western boundary currents that offsets the large extraction of heat by advection of cold, dry air of the continents and by transient eddies.

upper- and low-level pressure and wind patterns that
brings summertime moisture into the southwest United
States and ends the late spring wet period in the
Great Plains. The interannual variability of the
North American monsoon is examined using the
NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (1948-98). The diurnal and
seasonal evolution of 500-mb geopotential height,
integrated moisture flux, and integrated moisture
flux convergence are constructed using a 5-day
running mean for the months May through
September. All of the years are used to calculate an
average daily Z score that removes the diurnal,
seasonal, and intraseasonal variability. The 30-day
average Z score centered about the date is
correlated with Pacific sea surface temperature
anomaly (SSTA) indices associated with the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North
Pacific oscillation (NPO). These indices are Nino-3,
a North Pacific index, and a Pacific index that
combines the previous two. Regional time-evolving
precipitation indices for the Southwest and Great
Plains, which consider the total number of wet or
dry stations in a region, are also correlated with
the SSTA indices. The use of nonnormally distributed
point source precipitation data is avoided.
Teleconnections are computed relative to the
climatological evolution of the North American
monsoon, rather than to calendar months, thus more
accurately accounting for the climatological changes
in the large-scale circulation. Tropical and North
Pacific SSTs are related to the occurrence of the
Pacific Transition and East Pacific teleconnection
patterns, respectively, in June and July. A high
(low) NPO phase and El Nino (La Nina) conditions
favor a weaker (stronger) and southward (northward)
displaced monsoon ridge. These teleconnection
patterns affect the timing and large-scale
distribution of monsoon moisture. In the Great
Plains, the spring wet season is lengthened
(shortened) and early summer rainfall and integrated
moisture flux convergence are above (below)
average. In the Southwest, monsoon onset is late
(early) and early summer rainfall and integrated
moisture flux convergence are below (above)
average. Relationships with Pacific SSTA indices
decay in the later part of the monsoon coincident
with weakening of the jet stream across the Pacific
and strengthening of the monsoon ridge over North
America. The most coherent summer climate patterns
occur over the entire western United States when the
Pacific index is substantially high or low, such as
during the Midwest flood of 1993 and drought of
1988. The Pacific index in spring is a good
predictor of early summer height anomalies over the
western United States when the time evolution of the
North Pacific SST dipole is considered.},

Several pilot field experiments have been conducted so far, and the results are analyzed. The field experiments will continue through 2016. The STORM programme was originally conceived for understanding the Severe Thunderstorms known as Nor'westers that affect West Bengal and the Northeastern parts of India during the pre- monsoon season. The Nor'westers cause loss of human lives and damage to properties worth millions of Dollars annually. Since the neighbouring south Asian countries are also affected by thunderstorms, the STORM programme is expanded to cover the South Asian countries under the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). It covers all the SAARC countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) in 3 phases. Some of the science plans, viz., monitoring life cycle of Nor'westers/ severe thunderstorms, their three dimensional structure, to understand the interrelationship among dynamics, cloud microphysics and electrical properties in the thunderstorm environment are new to the severe weather research. This paper describes the general setting of the field experiment and discusses preliminary results based on the pilot field data. Typical lengths of the squall lines, 2 their intensity, and speed of movements, cloud top temperatures, and their heights are discussed based on the pilot field data. The SAARC STORM programme will complement the Severe Weather Forecast Demonstration Project (SWFDP) of WMO. It would also generate large-scale interest for fuelling research among the scientific community, and broaden the perspectives of operational meteorologists and researchers.},

Arctic sea ice area shows large interannual variability due to the numerous factors, but on longer time scales the total sea ice area is approximately linearly related to Arctic surface air temperature in models and observations. Overall, models however strongly underestimate the recent sea ice decline. Here we show that this can be explained with two interlinked biases. Most climate models simulate a smaller sea ice area reduction per degree local surface warming. Arctic polar amplification, the ratio between Arctic and global temperature, is also underestimated but a number of models are within the uncertainty estimated from natural variability. A recalibration of an ensemble of global climate models using observations over 28years provides a scenario independent relationship and yields about 2°C change in annual mean global surface temperature above present as the most likely global temperature threshold for September sea ice to disappear, but with substantial associated uncertainty. Natural variability in the Arctic is large and needs to be considered both for such recalibrations as well as for model evaluation, in particular when observed trends are relatively short. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.},

This study is concerned with identifying and removing from global-mean temperatures the signatures of natural climate variability over the period January 1900-March 2009.

After the volcanic eruptions are subsequently filtered from the record, the residual time series reveals a nearly monotonic global warming pattern since{\~{}}1950.

The models are found to have well-defined, distinguishable sensitivities in climate change experiments. The satellite-era observations show a larger sensitivity—a larger decline per degree of warming—than any of the models. To evaluate the role of natural variability in this discrepancy, the sensitivity probability density function is constructed based upon the observed trends and natural variability of multidecadal ice cover and global temperature trends in a long control run of the GFDL Climate Model, version 2.1 (CM2.1).

abstract = {Severe drought is arguably one of the greatest
recurring natural disasters that strikes North
America. A synthesis of multiproxy data shows that
North America was in the grip of a severe
centennial-scale drought during medieval times
(800-1300 AD). In this study, the Community
Atmospheric Model ( CAM) is used to investigate the
role of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from
the North Atlantic and the tropical Pacific Ocean on
this megadrought. These anomalies are obtained from
proxy reconstructions of SST. Four model experiments
with prescribed SST anomalies in the tropical
Pacific and/or North Atlantic Ocean were made. The
CAM results captured the major dry features that
occurred during medieval times in North America. The
cold tropical Pacific alone can simulate essentially
the drought intensity, while the warm North Atlantic
alone can simulate the drought areal extent. The two
working together can explain the severity and
longevity of the drought. During the spring season,
the cool tropical Pacific, or the warm North
Atlantic, or both, results in less moisture
transport to the High Plains, with a 15-40{\%}
decrease in rainfall. The importance of the Atlantic
Ocean on medieval drought in North America suggests
that attention should be paid not only to the
tropical Pacific Ocean but also to the North
Atlantic Ocean in understanding the North America
drought variability and predictability, both at
present and during the past. This is especially true
because the Pacific Ocean SST anomalies in medieval
times as recorded by proxy data are somewhat
controversial, while the North Atlantic anomalies
seem more certain.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Arctic sea ice thickness distributions from models participating in the World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are evaluated against observations from submarines, aircraft and satellites. While it is encouraging that the mean thickness distributions from the models are in general agreement with observations, the spatial patterns of sea ice thickness are poorly represented in most models. The poor spatial representation of thickness patterns is associated with a failure of models to represent details of the mean atmospheric circulation pattern that governs the transport and spatial distribution of sea ice. The climate models as a whole also tend to underestimate the rate of ice volume loss from 1979 to 2013, though the multimodel ensemble mean trend remains within the uncertainty of that from the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System. Although large uncertainties in observational products complicate model evaluations, these results raise concerns regarding the ability of CMIP5 models to realistically represent the processes driving the decline of Arctic sea ice and to project the timing of when a seasonally ice-free Arctic may become a reality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The likelihood of future hiatus periods is found to be sensitive to the rate of change of anthropogenic forcing. Under high rates of greenhouse gas emissions there is little chance of a hiatus decade occurring beyond 2030, even in the event of a large volcanic eruption.

The differences between the 11 sea-ice concentration estimates-structural uncertainties-were quantified and analyzed spatially and seasonally. The algorithms differ in annual sea-ice area by 0.0-1.3 million km2 and in extent by 0.0-0.6 million km2. Linear trends for 34- and 21-year periods were calculated and compared for sea-ice concentration, area and extent. Low-frequency algorithms obtained annual Arctic sea-ice area decrease of 0.534-0.573 million km2 per decade (0.439-0.491 million km2 per decade for the extent) over the period 1979 to 2012, and a decrease of 0.866-0.975 million km2 per decade (0.767-0.812 million km2 per decade for the extent) for the 1992-2012 period. High-frequency algorithms obtained a decrease of 0.766-0.978 million km2 per decade in the area and 0.758-0.814 million km2 per decade in the extent over the period 1992-2012. Results for all the algorithms have close agreement on the strength of the negative trend in Arctic sea-ice area and extent, but are individually biased from the mean.

abstract = {A hierarchy of Fl Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
prediction schemes has been developed during the
Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program
which includes statistical schemes and physical
models.The statistical models are, in general, based
on linear statistical techniques and can be
classified into models which use atmospheric (sea
level pressure or surface wind) or oceanic (sea
surface temperature or a measure of upper ocean heat
content) quantities or a combination of oceanic and
atmospheric quantities as predictors. The physical
models consist of coupled ocean-atmosphere models of
varying degrees of complexity, ranging from
simplified coupled models of the "shallow water"
type to coupled general circulation models. All
models, statistical and physical, perform
considerably better than the persistence forecast in
predicting typical indices of ENSO on lead times of
6 to 12 months. The TOGA program can be regarded as
a success from this perspective. However, despite
the demonstrated predictability, little is known
about ENSO predictability limits and the
predictability of phenomena outside the tropical
Pacific. Furthermore, the predictability of
anomalous features known to be associated with ENSO
(e.g., Indian monsoon and Sahel rainfall, southern
African drought, and off-equatorial sea surface
temperature) needs to be addressed in more
detail. As well, the relative importance of
different physical mechanisms (in the ocean or
atmosphere) has yet to be established. A seasonal
dependence in predictability is seen in many models,
but the processes responsible for it are not fully
understood, and its meaning is still a matter of
scientific discussion. Likewise, a marked decadal
variation in skill is observed, and the reasons for
this are still under investigation. Finally, the
different prediction models yield similar skills,
although they are initialized quite differently. The
reasons for these differences are also unclear.},

abstract = {An asymmetry, and its multidecadal variability, in a
rainfall teleconnection with the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) are described. Further, the
breakdown of this relationship since 1980 is offered
as a cause for a rainfall reduction in an
ENSO-affected region, southeast Queensland
(SEQ). There, austral summer rainfall has been
declining since around the 1980s, but the associated
process is not understood. It is demonstrated that
the rainfall reduction is not simulated by the
majority of current climate models forced with
anthropogenic forcing factors. Examination shows
that ENSO is a rainfall-generating mechanism for the
region because of an asymmetry in its impact: the La
Nina-rainfall relationship is statistically
significant, as SEQ summer rainfall increases with
La Nina amplitude; by contrast, the El Nino-induced
rainfall reductions do not have a statistically
significant relationship with El Nino
amplitude. Since 1980, this asymmetry no longer
operates, and La Nina events no longer induce a
rainfall increase, leading to the observed SEQ
rainfall reduction. A similar asymmetric rainfall
teleconnection with ENSO Modoki exists and shares
the same temporal evolutions. This breakdown is
caused by an eastward shift in the Walker
circulation and the convection center near
Australia's east coast, in association with a
post-1980 positive phase of the interdecadal Pacific
oscillation (IPO). Such a breakdown occurred before
1950, indicating that multidecadal variability alone
could potentially be responsible for the recent SEQ
rainfall decline. An aggregation of outputs from
climate models to distill the impact of climate
change suggests that the asymmetry and the breakdown
may not be generated by climate change, although
most models do not perform well in simulating the
ENSO-rainfall teleconnection over the SEQ region.},

abstract = {This study examines the predictability of seasonal
mean Great Plains precipitation using an ensemble of
century-long atmospheric general circulation model
(AGCM) simulations forced with observed sea surface
temperatures (SSTs). The results show that the
predictability (intraensemble spread) of the
precipitation response to SST forcing varies on
interannual and longer time scales. In particular,
this study finds that pluvial conditions are more
predictable (have less intraensemble spread) than
drought conditions. This rather unexpected result is
examined in the context of the physical mechanisms
that impact precipitation in the Great Plains. These
mechanisms include El Nino-Southern Oscillation's
impact on the planetary waves and hence the Pacific
storm track (primarily during the cold season), the
role of Atlantic SSTs in forcing changes in the
Bermuda high and low-level moisture flux into the
continent (primarily during the warm season), and
soil moisture feedbacks (primarily during the warm
season). It is found that the changes in
predictability are primarily driven by changes in
the strength of the land-atmosphere coupling, such
that under dry conditions a given change in soil
moisture produces a larger change in evaporation and
hence precipitation than the same change in soil
moisture would produce under wet soil
conditions. The above changes in predictability are
associated with a negatively skewed distribution in
the seasonal mean precipitation during the warm
season-a result that is not inconsistent with the
observations.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A long-standing discrepancy exists between general circulation models (GCMs) and satellite observations: The multimodel mean temperature of the midtroposphere (TMT) in the tropics warms at approximately twice the rate of observations. Using a large ensemble of simulations from a single climate model, we find that tropical TMT trends (1979–2018) vary widely and that a subset of realizations are within the range of satellite observations. Realizations with relatively small tropical TMT trends are accompanied by subdued sea-surface warming in the tropical central and eastern Pacific. Observed changes in sea-surface temperature have a similar pattern, implying that the observed tropical TMT trend has been reduced by multidecadal variability. We also assess the latest generation of GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). CMIP6 simulations with muted warming over the central and eastern Pacific also show reduced tropical tropospheric warming. We find that 13{\%} of the model realizations have tropical TMT trends within the observed trend range. These simulations are from models with both small and large climate sensitivity values, illustrating that the magnitude of tropical tropospheric warming is not solely a function of climate sensitivity. For global averages, one-quarter of model simulations exhibit TMT trends in accord with observations. Our results indicate that even on 40-y timescales, natural climate variability is important to consider when comparing observed and simulated tropospheric warming and is sufficiently large to explain TMT trend differences between models and satellite data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Seasonal transitions from winter to spring impact a wide variety of ecological and physical systems. While the effects of early springs across North America are widely documented, changes in their frequency and likelihood under the combined influences of climate change and natural variability are poorly understood. Extremely early springs, such as March 2012, can lead to severe economical losses and agricultural damage when these are followed by hard freeze events. Here we use the new Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble project and Extended Spring Indices to simulate historical and future spring onsets across the United States and in the particular the Great Lakes region. We found a marked increase in the frequency of March 2012-like springs by midcentury in addition to an overall trend towards earlier spring onsets, which nearly doubles that of observational records. However, changes in the date of last freeze do not occur at the same rate, therefore, causing a potential increase in the threat of plant tissue damage. Although large-scale climate modes, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, have previously dominated decadal to multidecadal spring onset trends, our results indicate a decreased role in natural climate variability and hence a greater forced response by the end of the century for modulating trends. Without a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, our study suggests that years like 2012 in the US could become normal by mid-century.},

We calculate mass discharge, D, into the ocean directly for 107 glaciers (85{\%} of D) and indirectly for 110 glaciers (15{\%}) using velocity-scaled reference fluxes. The decadal mass balance switched from a mass gain of +47 ± 21 Gt/y in 1972–1980 to a loss of 51 ± 17 Gt/y in 1980–1990. The mass loss increased from 41 ± 17 Gt/y in 1990–2000, to 187 ± 17 Gt/y in 2000–2010, to 286 ± 20 Gt/y in 2010–2018, or sixfold since the 1980s, or 80 ± 6 Gt/y per decade, on average. The acceleration in mass loss switched from positive in 2000–2010 to negative in 2010–2018 due to a series of cold summers, which illustrates the difficulty of extrapolating short records into longer-term trends. Cumulated since 1972, the largest contributions to global sea level rise are from northwest (4.4 ± 0.2 mm), southeast (3.0 ± 0.3 mm), and central west (2.0 ± 0.2 mm) Greenland, with a total 13.7 ± 1.1 mm for the ice sheet. The mass loss is controlled at 66 ± 8{\%} by glacier dynamics (9.1 mm) and 34 ± 8{\%} by SMB (4.6 mm). Even in years of high SMB, enhanced glacier discharge has remained sufficiently high above equilibrium to maintain an annual mass loss every year since 1998.},

However, due to their multilayer nonlinear structure, they are not transparent, i.e., it is hard to grasp what makes them arrive at a particular classification or recognition decision, given a new unseen data sample. Recently, several approaches have been proposed enabling one to understand and interpret the reasoning embodied in a DNN for a single test image. These methods quantify the 'importance' of individual pixels with respect to the classification decision and allow a visualization in terms of a heatmap in pixel/input space. While the usefulness of heatmaps can be judged subjectively by a human, an objective quality measure is missing. In this paper, we present a general methodology based on region perturbation for evaluating ordered collections of pixels such as heatmaps. We compare heatmaps computed by three different methods on the SUN397, ILSVRC2012, and MIT Places data sets. Our main result is that the recently proposed layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively provides a better explanation of what made a DNN arrive at a particular classification decision than the sensitivity-based approach or the deconvolution method. We provide theoretical arguments to explain this result and discuss its practical implications. Finally, we investigate the use of heatmaps for unsupervised assessment of the neural network performance.},

A fingerprint for the occurrence of QRA can be defined in terms of the zonally averaged surface temperature field. Examining state-of-the-art [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)] climate model projections, we find that QRA events are likely to increase by {\~{}}50{\%} this century under business-as-usual carbon emissions, but there is considerable variation among climate models. Some predict a near tripling of QRA events by the end of the century, while others predict a potential decrease. Models with amplified Arctic warming yield the most pronounced increase in QRA events. The projections are strongly dependent on assumptions regarding the nature of changes in radiative forcing associated with anthropogenic aerosols over the next century. One implication of our findings is that a reduction in midlatitude aerosol loading could actually lead to Arctic de-amplification this century, ameliorating potential increases in persistent extreme weather events.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {[1] In the South Pacific, interdecadal-decadal
oceanic and atmospheric variability, referred to as
the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), is most
pronounced in the South Pacific Convergence Zone
(SPCZ) salinity front region. Here we have used
annual average oxygen isotope (delta O-18) time
series from five coral cores collected from Fiji and
Tonga in this region to construct a Fiji-Tonga
Interdecadal-Decadal Pacific Oscillation (F-T IDPO)
index of low-frequency ({\textgreater} 9 and {\textless} 55 years) climate
variability back to 1650 A. D. We first demonstrate
the consistency between this F-T IDPO index and a
mean sea level (MSL) pressure-based SPCZ position
index (SPI) (1891-2000), thus verifying the ability
of coral delta O-18 to record past
interdecadal-decadal climatic variations in this
region back to 1891. The F-T IDPO index is then
shown to be synchronous with the IPO index
(1856-2000), suggesting that this coral-based index
effectively represents the interdecadal-decadal
scale climate variance back to 1650. The regularity
of the F-T IDPO index indicates that
interdecadal-decadal variability in the SPCZ region
has been relatively constant over the past 350 years
with a mean frequency of similar to 20 years
(variance peaks near 11 and 35 years). There is a
consistent antiphase correlation of the F-T IDPO
index and the interdecadal-decadal components in
equatorial Pacific coral delta O-18 series from
Maiana and Palmyra. This observation indicates that
the eastward expansion (westward contraction) of the
eastern salinity front of the Western Pacific Warm
Pool (WPWP) occurs simultaneously (+/-{\textless}= 1 year)
with the westward (eastward) shift of the SPCZ
salinity front during positive IPO (negative IPO)
phases. This is the same relationship observed
during the phases of the El Nino Southern
Oscillation.},

methodology of landscape phenology (LP), along with
synopsis of a case study conducted in the northern

questions related to ecosystem phenology, landscape

existing studies. Intensive in situ observations,
remote sensing data, and spatiotemporal analysis are
employed for understanding patterns and processes
within the complexity of seasonal landscape
dynamics. A hierarchical upscaling approach is also
introduced. Results from the case study suggest that
plot-scale phenology lacks spatial autocorrelation

heterogeneity overriding small microenvironmental
gradients. However, at the landscape level, forest
phenology responds coherently to weather
fluctuations. The resultant LP index confirms the
relative reliability of moderate resolution imaging
spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based land surface
phenology (LSP). Due to technological advancement in
spatial data acquisition and analysis, LP has the
ability to connect conventional plant phenology
studies back to their intricate ecological context,

A major unresolved issue relating to internal climate dynamics is the mode and tempo of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation variability, and the significance of decadal-to-centennial scale changes in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength in regulating the climate of the last millennium. Here we use the time-constrained high-resolution local radiocarbon reservoir age offset derived from an absolutely dated annually resolved shell chronology spanning the past 1,350 years, to reconstruct changes in surface ocean circulation and climate. The water mass tracer data presented here from the North Icelandic shelf, combined with previously published data from the Arctic and subtropical Atlantic, show that surface Atlantic meridional overturning circulation dynamics likely amplified the relatively warm conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the relatively cool conditions during the Little Ice Age within the North Atlantic sector.},

the phase shift between leaf phenology and
photosynthesis seasonality in a semi-arid Pinus
halepensis forest system, not seen in temperate
sites. Leaf-scale measurements of gas exchange,
nitrogen and phenology were used on daily, seasonal
and annual time-scales. Peak photosynthesis was in
late winter, when high soil moisture, mild
temperatures and low leaf vapour pressure deficit
(D-L) allowed high rates associated with high water-
and nitrogen-use efficiencies. Self-sustained new
needle growth through the dry and hot summer
maximized photosynthesis in the following wet
season, without straining carbon storage. Low rates
of water loss were associated with increasing
sensitivity of stomatal conductance (g(s)) to soil
moisture below a relative extractable water (REW) of
0.4, and decreased g(s) sensitivity to D-L below REW
of approx. 0.2. This response was captured by the
modified Ball-Berry (Leuning) model. While most
physiological parameters and responses measured were
typical of temperate pines, the
photosynthesis-phenological phasing contributed to
high productivity under warm-dry conditions. This
contrasts with reported effects of short-term
periodical droughts and could lead to different

This has far-reaching consequences for indigenous and local communities, polar ecosystems, and global climate, motivating the need for accurate seasonal sea ice forecasts. While physics-based dynamical models can successfully forecast sea ice concentration several weeks ahead, they struggle to outperform simple statistical benchmarks at longer lead times. We present a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system, IceNet. The system has been trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps. We show that IceNet advances the range of accurate sea ice forecasts, outperforming a state-of-the-art dynamical model in seasonal forecasts of summer sea ice, particularly for extreme sea ice events. This step-change in sea ice forecasting ability brings us closer to conservation tools that mitigate risks associated with rapid sea ice loss. Accurate seasonal forecasts of sea ice are highly valuable, particularly in the context of sea ice loss due to global warming. A new machine learning tool for sea ice forecasting offers a substantial increase in accuracy over current physics-based dynamical model predictions.},

abstract = {The Arctic region has warmed more than twice as fast as the global average [mdash] a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. The rapid Arctic warming has contributed to dramatic melting of Arctic sea ice and spring snow cover, at a pace greater than that simulated by climate models. These profound changes to the Arctic system have coincided with a period of ostensibly more frequent extreme weather events across the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, including severe winters. The possibility of a link between Arctic change and mid-latitude weather has spurred research activities that reveal three potential dynamical pathways linking Arctic amplification to mid-latitude weather: changes in storm tracks, the jet stream, and planetary waves and their associated energy propagation. Through changes in these key atmospheric features, it is possible, in principle, for sea ice and snow cover to jointly influence mid-latitude weather. However, because of incomplete knowledge of how high-latitude climate change influences these phenomena, combined with sparse and short data records, and imperfect models, large uncertainties regarding the magnitude of such an influence remain. We conclude that improved process understanding, sustained and additional Arctic observations, and better coordinated modelling studies will be needed to advance our understanding of the influences on mid-latitude weather and extreme events.},

The paper's purpose is to provide scientific users of the CryoSat data with a description of the design and operation of the SIRAL radar and the CryoSat platform, the data products, and the expected error budget. The ‘low-resolution mode' (LRM), ‘synthetic aperture mode' (SARM) and “synthetic aperture interferometric mode' (SARInM) of the SIRAL radar are described, together with its system parameters, its antenna gain pattern and interferometer phase difference pattern, and its calibration modes. The orbit is described, together with the platform attitude and altitude control law and control systems, and the expected pointing and altitude knowledge. The geographical masks that are used to determine acquisitions in the three SIRAL modes are described. The SIRAL data products, and the processing applied to produce them, are described. Level 1b, level 2 and higher-level products are described in turn, with a particular emphasis on the new procedures applied to the SARInM and SARM processing over ice surfaces. The beam forming and multi-looking is summarised, and a description is given of the behaviour of the SARM and SARInM echoes over idealised surfaces. These inform descriptions of the elevation retrievals of the level 2 processing, including the SARInM retrieval of interferometric phase. The combination of these data, through cross-over analysis over continental ice sheets, and through averaging over sea-ice, to determine areal averages of ice sheet elevation change or sea-ice thickness, is described. The error budget in these higher-level products is described, together with its breakdown into errors arising from the instrument and errors arising from the retrievals. The importance of the co-variance of these errors in determining the final error is stressed. The description of the errors also includes a summary of the experiments required following the launch to validate the CryoSat mission data. An estimate of the mission performance over ice surfaces is made at various spatial scales, and it is concluded that even the relatively short, three-year duration of the CryoSat mission will allow it to make an important scientific contribution, particularly when combined with results from earlier satellite missions.},

abstract = {Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can potentially provide powerful tools for classifying, identifying, and predicting patterns in climate and environmental data. However, because of the inherent complexities of such data, which are often spatio-temporal, chaotic, and non-stationary, the CNN algorithms must be designed/evaluated for each specific dataset and application. Yet CNN, being a supervised technique, requires a large labeled dataset to start. Labeling demands (human) expert time which, combined with the limited number of relevant examples in this area, can discourage using CNNs for new problems. To address these challenges, here we (1) Propose an effective auto-labeling strategy based on using an unsupervised clustering algorithm and evaluating the performance of CNNs in re-identifying and predicting these clusters up to 5 days ahead of time; (2) Use this approach to label thousands of daily large-scale weather patterns over North America in the outputs of a fully-coupled climate model and show the capabilities of CNNs in re-identifying and predicting the 4 clustered regimes up to 5 days ahead of time. The deep CNN trained with 1000 samples or more per cluster has an accuracy of 90{\%} or better for both identification and prediction while prediction accuracy scales weakly with the number of lead days. Accuracy scales monotonically but nonlinearly with the size of the training set, e.g. reaching 94{\%} with 3000 training samples per cluster for identification and 93–76{\%} for prediction at lead day 1–5, outperforming logistic regression, a simpler machine learning algorithm, by  {\~{}} 25{\%}.

abstract = {On short (15-year) to mid-term (30-year) time-scales how the Earth's surface temperature evolves can be dominated by internal variability as demonstrated by the global-warming pause or 'hiatus'. In this study, we use six single model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs) and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) to visualise the role of internal variability in controlling possible observable surface temperature trends in the short-term and mid-term projections from 2019 onwards. We confirm that in the short-term, surface temperature trend projections are dominated by internal variability, with little influence of structural model differences or warming pathway. Additionally we demonstrate that this result is independent of the model-dependent estimate of the magnitude of internal variability. Indeed, and perhaps counter intuitively, in all models a lack of warming, or even a cooling trend could be observed at all individual points on the globe, even under the largest greenhouse gas emissions. The near-equivalence of all six SMILEs and CMIP5 demonstrates the robustness of this result to the choice of models used. On the mid-term time-scale, we confirm that structural model differences and scenario uncertainties play a larger role in controlling surface temperature trend projections than they did on the shorter time-scale. In addition we show that whether internal variability still dominates, or whether model uncertainties and internal variability are a similar magnitude, depends on the estimate of internal variability, which differs between the SMILEs. Finally we show that even out to thirty years large parts of the globe (or most of the globe in MPI-GE and CMIP5) could still experience no-warming due to internal variability.},

last four decades of the 20th Century also represent
one of the wettest periods in the
reconstruction. The proxy record indicates that the
instrumental record (approximately 1900 to the
Present) underestimates the potential frequency and
severity of severe, sustained droughts in this area,
while over representing the prominence of wet
episodes. In the longer record, the empirical
probability of any decadal scale drought exceeding
the duration of the 1954 through 1964 drought is 94
percent, while the probability for any wet event
exceeding the duration of the 1965 through 1999 wet
spell is only 1 percent. Hence, estimates of future
water availability in the Uinta Basin and forecasts
for exports to the Colorado River, based on the 1961
to 1990 and 1971 to 2000 "normal" periods, may be
overly optimistic.},

as follows: (I) from 40 ka to 1 Ma a flat spectrum
is observed; (2) from 2 ka to 40 ka the spectrum is
proportional to f(-2) where f is the frequency; and
(3) below time scales of 2 ka the power spectrum is
proportional to f(-1/2). At time scales less than 1
month we observe that the power spectra of
continental stations become proportional to f(-3/2)
while maritime stations continue to have power
spectra proportional to f(-1/2) down to time scales
of 1 day. To explain these observations, we model
the vertical transport of heat in the atmosphere as
a stochastic diffusion process. The power spectrum
of temperature fluctuations at the earth's surface
expected from this model equation in a two-layer
geometry with thermal and eddy diffusion properties
appropriate to the atmosphere and the ocean and a
radiation condition at the top of the atmosphere
agrees with the observed spectrum. The difference in
power spectra between continental and marine
stations can be understood with this approach as a
consequence of the air mass above a maritime station
exchanging heat with both the atmosphere above and
the ocean below while a continental station
exchanges heat mostly with the atmosphere above. (C)

Whether such emissions scenarios would prevent a summer sea-ice-free Arctic is unknown. Here we employ stabilized warming simulations with an Earth System Model to obtain sea-ice projections under stabilized global warming, and correct biases in mean sea-ice coverage by constraining with observations. Although there is some sensitivity to details in the constraining method, the observationally constrained projections suggest that the benefits of going from 2.0 °C to 1.5 °C stabilized warming are substantial; an eightfold decrease in the frequency of ice-free conditions is expected, from once in every five to once in every forty years. Under 3.0 °C global mean warming, however, permanent summer ice-free conditions are likely, which emphasizes the need for nations to increase their commitments to the Paris Agreement.},

abstract = {Projections of future climate change are increasingly based on the output of many different models. Typically, the mean over all model simulations is considered as the optimal prediction, with the underlying assumption that different models provide statistically independent information evenly distributed around the true state. However, there is reason to believe that this is not the best assumption. Coupled models are of comparable complexity and are constructed in similar ways. Some models share parts of the same code and some models are even developed at the same center. Therefore, the limitations of these models tend to be fairly similar, contributing to the well-known problem of common model biases and possibly to an unrealistically small spread in the outcomes of model predictions. This study attempts to quantify the extent of this problem by asking how many models there effectively are and howto best determine this number.Quantifying the effective number ofmodels is achieved by evaluating 24 state-of-the-art models and their ability to simulate broad aspects of twentieth-century climate. Using two different approaches, the amount of unique information in the ensemble is calculated and the effective ensemble size is found to be much smaller than the actual number of models. As more models are included in an ensemble, the amount of new information diminishes in proportion. Furthermore, this reduction is found to go beyond the problem of "same center" models and systemic similarities are seen to exist across all models. The results suggest that current methodologies for the interpretation of multimodel ensembles may lead to overly confident climate predictions. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

483 drought-sensitive tree-ring chronologies
available across the continental US. In contrast
with the 'point-by-point' (PPR) local regression
technique used previously, the tree-ring data were
calibrated against the instrumental record of summer
drought (June-August Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI)) based on application of the 'Regularized
Expectation Maximization' ('RegEM') algorithm to
relate large-scale patterns of variation in proxy
and instrumental data over a common (twentieth
century) interval. A screening procedure was first
used to select an optimal subset of candidate
tree-ring drought predictors, and the predictors
(tree-ring data) and predictand (instrumental PDSI)
were prewhitened prior to calibration, with serial
correlation added back into the reconstruction at
the end of the procedure. The PDSI field was
separated into eight relatively homogenous regions
of summer drought through a cluster analysis, and
three distinct calibration schemes were
investigated: (i) 'global' (i.e., entire
conterminous US domain) proxy data calibrated
against 'global' PDSI; (ii) regional proxy data
calibrated against regional PDSI; and (iii) global
proxy data calibrated against regional PDSI. The
greatest cross-validated skill was evident for case
(iii), suggesting the existence of useful non-local
information in the tree-ring predictor
set. Cross-validation results based on withheld late
nineteenth/early twentieth-century instrumental
data, as well as a regionally limited extension of
cross-validation results back to the mid-nineteenth
century based on long available instrumental series,
indicate a modest improvement in reconstructive
skill over the PPR approach. At the continental
scale, the 1930s 'Dust Bowl' remains the most severe

estimated uncertainties, but more severe episodes
may have occurred at regional scales in past

abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of aerosol forcing uncertainty on the robustness of estimates of the twentieth-century warming attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Attribution analyses on three coupled climate models with very different sensitivities and aerosol forcing are carried out. The Third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere GCM (HadCM3), Parallel Climate Model (PCM), and GFDL R30 models all provide good simulations of twentieth-century global mean temperature changes when they include both anthropogenic and natural forcings. Such good agreement could result from a fortuitous cancellation of errors, for example, by balancing too much (or too little) greenhouse warming by too much (or too little) aerosol cooling. Despite a very large uncertainty for estimates of the possible range of sulfate aerosol forcing obtained from measurement campaigns, results show that the spatial and temporal nature of observed twentieth-century temperature change constrains the component of past warming attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse gases to be significantly greater (at the 5{\%} level) than the observed warming over the twentieth century. The cooling effects of aerosols are detected in all three models. Both spatial and temporal aspects of observed temperature change are responsible for constraining the relative roles of greenhouse warming and sulfate cooling over the twentieth century. This is because there are distinctive temporal structures in differential warming rates between the hemispheres, between land and ocean, and between mid- and low latitudes. As a result, consistent estimates of warming attributable to greenhouse gas emissions are obtained from all three models, and predictions are relatively robust to the use of more or less sensitive models. The transient climate response following a 1{\%} yr-1 increase in CO2 is estimated to lie between 2.2 and 4 K century-1 (5-95 percentiles). {\textcopyright} 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

Four experiments are performed, combining low and high sea ice states with global sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies associated with opposite phases of the AMO. A trough–ridge–trough response to wintertime sea ice loss is seen in the Pacific–North American sector in the negative phase of the AMO.

abstract = {This study highlights the relative importance of internally generated versus externally forced climate trends over the next 50 yr (2010-60) at local and regional scales over North America in two global coupled model ensembles. Both ensembles contain large numbers of integrations (17 and 40): each of which is subject to identical anthropogenic radiative forcing (e.g., greenhouse gas increase) but begins from a slightly different initial atmospheric state. Thus, the diversity of projected climate trends within each model ensemble is due solely to intrinsic, unpredictable variability of the climate system. Both model ensembles show that natural climate variability superimposed upon forced climate change will result in a range of possible future trends for surface air temperature and precipitation over the next 50 yr. Precipitation trends are particularly subject to uncertainty as a result of internal variability, with signal-to-noise ratios less than 2. Intrinsic atmospheric circulation variability is mainly responsible for the spread in future climate trends, imparting regional coherence to the internally driven air temperature and precipitation trends. The results underscore the importance of conducting a large number of climate change projections with a given model, as each realization will contain a different superposition of unforced and forced trends. Such initial-condition ensembles are also needed to determine the anthropogenic climate response at local and regional scales and provide a new perspective on how to usefully compare climate change projections across models. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {We present a first assessment of airborne laser and radar altimeter data over snow-covered sea ice, gathered during the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Operation IceBridge Mission. We describe a new technique designed to process radar echograms from the University of Kansas snow radar to estimate snow depth. We combine IceBridge laser altimetry with radar-derived snow depths to determine sea ice thickness. Results are validated through comparison with direct measurements of snow and ice thickness collected in situ at the Danish GreenArc 2009 sea ice camp located on fast ice north of Greenland. The IceBridge instrument suite provides accurate measurements of snow and ice thickness, particularly over level ice. Mean IceBridge snow and ice thickness agree with in situ measurements to within {\~{}} 0.01 and {\~{}} 0.05 m, respectively, while modal snow and ice thickness estimates agree to within 0.02 and 0.10 m, respectively. IceBridge snow depths were correlated with in situ measurements (R = 0.7, for an averaging length of 55 m). The uncertainty associated with the derived IceBridge sea ice thickness estimates is 0.40 m. The results demonstrate the retrieval of both first-year and multiyear ice thickness from IceBridge data. The airborne data were however compromised in heavily ridged ice where snow depth, and hence ice thickness, could not be measured. Techniques developed as part of this study will be used for routine processing of IceBridge retrievals over Arctic sea ice. The limitations of the GreenArc study are discussed, and recommendations for future validation of airborne measurements via field activities are provided.},

abstract = {As a step towards understanding the fundamental drivers of polar climate change, we evaluate contributions to polar warming and its seasonal and hemispheric asymmetries in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) as compared with CMIP5. CMIP6 models broadly capture the observed pattern of surface- and winter-dominated Arctic warming that has outpaced both tropical and Antarctic warming in recent decades. For both CMIP5 and CMIP6, CO2 quadrupling experiments reveal that the lapse-rate and albedo feedbacks contribute most to stronger warming in the Arctic than the tropics or Antarctic. The relative strength of the polar albedo feedback in comparison to the lapse-rate feedback is sensitive to the choice of radiative kernel, and the albedo feedback contributes most to intermodel spread in polar warming at both poles. By separately calculating moist and dry atmospheric heat transport, we show that increased poleward moisture transport is another important driver of Arctic amplification and the largest contributor to projected Antarctic warming. Seasonal ocean heat storage and winter-amplified temperature feedbacks contribute most to the winter peak in warming in the Arctic and a weaker winter peak in the Antarctic. In comparison with CMIP5, stronger polar warming in CMIP6 results from a larger albedo feedback at both poles, combined with less-negative cloud feedbacks in the Arctic and increased poleward moisture transport in the Antarctic. However, normalizing by the global-mean surface warming yields a similar degree of Arctic amplification and only slightly increased Antarctic amplification in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5.},

abstract = {Near-record warmth over much of the United States during March 2007 promoted early growth of crops and vegetation. A widespread arctic air outbreak followed in early April, resulting in extensive agricultural losses over much of the south-central and southeastern US. This 'false spring' event also resulted in widespread damage to newly grown tissues of native deciduous forest species, shown by previous researchers to have had measurable effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. The current study reconstructed the historical occurrence of false springs over most of the southeastern quarter of the conterminous US (32–39°N; 75–98°W) from 1901 to 2007 using daily maximum and minimum temperature records from 176 stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network database, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations. A false spring index was derived that examined the timing of the start of the growing season (SGS), or leaf emergence, relative to the timing of a potentially damaging last hard freeze (minimum temperature ≤ −  2.2 °C). SGS was modeled for the domain by combining EVI data with ground-based temperature 'degree day' calculations reflecting the rate of springtime warming. No significant area-wide, long-term SGS trend was found; however, over much of a contiguous region stretching from Mississippi eastward to the Carolinas, the timing of the last hard freeze was found to occur significantly later, this change occurring along with increased frequency of false springs. Earlier last hard freeze dates and decreased frequency of false springs were found over much of the northwestern part of the study region, including Arkansas and southern Missouri.},

the same as the dominant wind direction in dune

extended to more precisely determine the timing of

This EOF analysis captures a strong linkage between the vertical component of lower-stratospheric wave activity over Eurasia and the subsequent development of hemisphere-wide surface circulation anomalies, which are strongly related to the Arctic Oscillation. Wintertime stratosphere–troposphere events picked out by this diagnostic often have a precursor in autumn: years with large October snow extent over Eurasia feature strong wintertime upward-propagating planetary wave pulses, a weaker wintertime polar vortex, and high geopotential heights in the wintertime polar troposphere.

abstract = {All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition to the direct effects on climate--for example, on the frequency of heatwaves--this increase in surface temperatures has important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability--predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions--are likely to be severe.},

It is found that the use of data averaged over periods longer than the inherent time-scale of the involved variables can result in a dramatic weakening of the detected nonlinearity.

abstract = {There is a growing need for skilful predictions of climate up to a decade ahead. Decadal climate predictions show high skill for surface temperature, but confidence in forecasts of precipitation and atmospheric circulation is much lower. Recent advances in seasonal and annual prediction show that the signal-to-noise ratio can be too small in climate models, requiring a very large ensemble to extract the predictable signal. Here, we reassess decadal prediction skill using a much larger ensemble than previously available, and reveal significant skill for precipitation over land and atmospheric circulation, in addition to surface temperature. We further propose a more powerful approach than used previously to evaluate the benefit of initialisation with observations, improving our understanding of the sources of skill. Our results show that decadal climate is more predictable than previously thought and will aid society to prepare for, and adapt to, ongoing climate variability and change. There is increasing demand for near-time climate predictions to provide guidance for adaptation planning at policy-relevant timescales. Although previous work has shown some skill in forecasting decadal surface temperature, it has proven more difficult to make predictions for precipitation and atmospheric circulation. By using a large, multi-model ensemble of climate models, a multi-institution team lead by Doug Smith of the Met Office Hadley Centre, UK were able to make skillful decadal predictions for near surface temperature, precipitation for the Sahel and broad swathes of Europe and Eurasia, and mean sea level pressure for many regions, with some exceptions being predictions for the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean. Further work is needed to understand whether the instances in which forecasts and observations differ are due to internal variability or external factors such as solar variability, volcanoes and anthropogenic aerosols.},

abstract = {Current vegetation models hold constant the dynamics
of seasonal biospheric changes, neglecting annual
variability. One of these features, the spring
"green wave" (onset of leafing or "green-up") in
midlatitudes, is an example of the complex feedback
loop between the atmosphere and plant communities.
The green wave responds to the atmosphere, but, in
turn, leafing causes rapid changes in the
surface-layer energy budget. Annual variability
tends to obscure the magnitude of the green wave's
effects on conventional climatic records. When
meteorological data are "normalized" to the green
wave (averaged relative to first-leaf phenology data
rather than to calendar date), an actual break in
the spring maximum temperature curve can be
detected. This project examined many surface-level
meteorological variables (at standard shelter
height, representing surface-layer conditions)
during the time of spring leafing in order to detect
other changes and to further analyze the cause,
extent, and persistence of these annual
variations. The results show that the green wave
occurs in conjunction with discontinuities (signals)
in lower-atmospheric lapse rate, surface vapor
pressure, relative humidity, visibility, and V wind
component. These signals are consistent with the
start of plant photosynthetic activity, seasonal
shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns, and
physical changes in the nature of the surface
layer. A parameter from simple green-wave models
that identifies seasonal changes in the lower
atmosphere may be useful in operational forecasting
and GCM simulations that link the atmosphere and
biosphere.},

We find that the models' total zonally-integrated northward moisture flux agrees reasonably well with the reanalysis, but with large compensating regional biases. Specifically, the models systematically underpredict the moisture flux in the Atlantic sector and overpredict it in the Pacific sector. The biases are predominantly due to misrepresentation of extreme moisture flux events, which are know to exert a significant control on Arctic climate. Biases in these high-intensity fluxes are almost entirely contributed by biases in the meridional velocity, suggesting a link with biases in storm track activity at lower latitudes. We assess the extent to which the deficit of moisture intrusions in the Atlantic sector and excess in the Pacific sector may account for biases in the climate of the respective sectors.

abstract = {[1] The quasi-decadal oscillation (QDO) in the
Earth's climate system fluctuated in phase with the
11-year period signal in solar total irradiance
(STI) variability throughout the 20th century. The
QDO was associated with global average upper ocean
temperature variability dominated by the tropical
global average from 20 degrees S to 20 degrees
N. Earlier diagnosis of the tropical global average
oceanic thermal budget found the anomalous warming
tendency driven not by the radiative forcing
(similar to 0.15 W m(-2)) from the 11-year period
signal in STI but by the larger anomalous
quasi-decadal sensible plus latent heat flux
(similar to 0.5 W m(-2)) from the overlying
troposphere. Now we diagnose the corresponding
thermal budget of the tropical global average
atmospheric temperature variability, finding it
largest in the lower stratosphere (similar to 0.8
degrees K), decreasing downward into the lower
troposphere (similar to 0.15 degrees K) and the
upper ocean (similar to 0.05 degrees K). These
diagnostics find quasi- decadal temperature
variability in the tropical lower stratosphere
arising from a thermal balance between anomalous
radiative forcing (1.0 - 1.5 W m(-2)) by ozone
absorption of the 11-year signal in solar UV
irradiance variability (modified by absorption of
mean solar IR irradiance by volcanic aerosol
variability) and variable longwave radiation and
vertical advection. The latter two processes altered
the vertical gradient of equivalent potential
temperature in the tropical troposphere that allowed
mean vertical circulation to drive an anomalous
warming tendency in the lower troposphere. The
latter matched the amplitude and phase of the
downward quasi- decadal sensible plus latent heat
flux anomaly that drove the anomalous warming
tendency in the tropical global ocean.},

abstract = {This work documents the first version of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) new Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1). We focus on the standard resolution of the fully coupled physical model designed to address DOE mission-relevant water cycle questions. Its components include atmosphere and land (110-km grid spacing), ocean and sea ice (60 km in the midlatitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles), and river transport (55 km) models. This base configuration will also serve as a foundation for additional configurations exploring higher horizontal resolution as well as augmented capabilities in the form of biogeochemistry and cryosphere configurations. The performance of E3SMv1 is evaluated by means of a standard set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima simulations consisting of a long preindustrial control, historical simulations (ensembles of fully coupled and prescribed SSTs) as well as idealized CO2 forcing simulations. The model performs well overall with biases typical of other CMIP-class models, although the simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is weaker than many CMIP-class models. While the E3SMv1 historical ensemble captures the bulk of the observed warming between preindustrial (1850) and present day, the trajectory of the warming diverges from observations in the second half of the twentieth century with a period of delayed warming followed by an excessive warming trend. Using a two-layer energy balance model, we attribute this divergence to the model's strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing (ERFari+aci = −1.65 W/m2) and high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS = 5.3 K).},

Estimates1 indicate that by 2100 sea level will be about 500|[thinsp]|mm higher than today as a result of global warming, with thermal expansion of sea water accounting for over half of this rise. The melting of glaciers and ice sheets will contribute much of the remainder. We present an improved calculation of glacier melt, which uses the temperature patterns generated by a coupled atmosphere|[ndash]|ocean general circulation model2,3 as inputs to a seasonally and regionally differentiated glacier model4,5. Under specified greenhouse-gas and sulphate-aerosol forcings, our model predicts that glacier melt equivalent to 132|[thinsp]|mm of sea-level rise will occur over the period 1990|[ndash]|2100, with a further 76|[thinsp]|mm from melting of the Greenland ice sheet. These figures fall within the range of previous estimates made using simpler models1; the advantage of our approach is that we take into account the effects of regional and seasonal temperature variations.

Moreover, the effect of global warming on the relationship between these two modes remains unexplored. Therefore, we investigated the ENSO-IOD linkage for the years 1950-2014 using reanalysis data and high-resolution climate model simulations. The 1950-2014 period is of particular interest as rapid Indian Ocean warming since the 1950s has had a huge impact worldwide. Our results showed that the IOD had robust causal effects on ENSO, whereas the impact of ENSO on IOD exhibited lower confidence. All models demonstrated that the IOD was unlikely to have no causal effects on ENSO, whereas eight out of 15 studied models and the reanalysis data showed significant causal effects at the 10{\%} significance level. The analyses provide new evidence that ENSO interannual variability might be forced by changes in Indo-Pacific Walker circulation induced by the IOD. Weak control of ENSO on the IOD is likely due to nonsignificant effects of ENSO on the western tropical Indian Ocean, implying that the rapid warming environment in the Indian Ocean may fundamentally modulate the relationship between the IOD and ENSO. We find high agreement between the models and reanalysis data in simulating the ENSO-IOD connection. These results indicate that the effects of the IOD on ENSO might be more significant than previously thought.},

abstract = {A new analysis apparatus, the multiscale window
transform (MWT), is developed to generalize the
classical mean-eddy decomposition (MED) in fluid
mechanics to include three or more ranges of scales,
and to ensure a faithful representation of localized
energy processes. The development begins with the
introduction of a sequence of finite-dimensional
subspaces of L-2[0, 1], {\{}V-rho,V- j{\}}(0 {\textless}= j {\textless}= j2),
based on a multiresolution analysis of L-2(R). All
the V(rho,j2)are sampling spaces, i. e., spaces
spanned by some translation invariant basis. The
upper bound of the index of scale level, j(2), is
prescribed in accordance with the signal of
concern. Within V-rho,V-j2, the concepts of
largescale, mesoscale, and submesoscale windows are
introduced, each being a subspace of V-rho,V-j2 and
containing exclusively a range of scales. A
transform- reconstruction pair is constructed on
each window, representing the features for the
corresponding range of scales. The resulting MWT has
several useful properties. Of particular importance
is a property of marginalization, which allows for a
simple representation of energy on speci. ed windows
and localizations. The MWT has been connected to
other existing analysis techniques: The classical
MED turns out to be a particular case, with
averaging acting as both a transform and a
reconstruction in the MWT framework; it has also
been compared with wavelet analysis and the Hilbert
- Huang transform. As a realization, we show how an
MWT is built with an orthonormalized cubic spline
system. Computational techniques leading to a fast
transform scheme are also presented. The MWT is
validated with two examples, and its applications in
the study of hydrodynamic stability analysis (fully
nonlinear) are discussed and exempli. ed.},

abstract = {We outline a new and improved uncertainty analysis for the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature product version 4 (GISTEMP v4). Historical spatial variations in surface temperature anomalies are derived from historical weather station data and ocean data from ships, buoys, and other sensors. Uncertainties arise from measurement uncertainty, changes in spatial coverage of the station record, and systematic biases due to technology shifts and land cover changes. Previously published uncertainty estimates for GISTEMP included only the effect of incomplete station coverage. Here, we update this term using currently available spatial distributions of source data, state-of-the-art reanalyses, and incorporate independently derived estimates for ocean data processing, station homogenization, and other structural biases. The resulting 95{\%} uncertainties are near 0.05 °C in the global annual mean for the last 50 years and increase going back further in time reaching 0.15 °C in 1880. In addition, we quantify the benefits and inherent uncertainty due to the GISTEMP interpolation and averaging method. We use the total uncertainties to estimate the probability for each record year in the GISTEMP to actually be the true record year (to that date) and conclude with 86{\%} likelihood that 2016 was indeed the hottest year of the instrumental period (so far).},

abstract = {Earth system models (ESMs) are our main tools for quantifying the physical state of the Earth and predicting how it might change in the future under ongoing anthropogenic forcing. In recent years, however, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been increasingly used to augment or even replace classical ESM tasks, raising hopes that AI could solve some of the grand challenges of climate science. In this Perspective we survey the recent achievements and limitations of both process-based models and AI in Earth system and climate research, and propose a methodological transformation in which deep neural networks and ESMs are dismantled as individual approaches and reassembled as learning, self-validating and interpretable ESM–network hybrids. Following this path, we coin the term neural Earth system modelling. We examine the concurrent potential and pitfalls of neural Earth system modelling and discuss the open question of whether AI can bolster ESMs or even ultimately render them obsolete. In the past few years, AI approaches have been used to enhance Earth and climate modelling. This Perspective examines the opportunity to go further, and build from scratch hybrid systems that integrate AI tools and models based on physical process knowledge to make more efficient use of daily observational data streams.},

abstract = {Today, the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
system is the primary driver of interannual
variability in global climate, but its long-term
behaviour is poorly understood. Instrumental
observations reveal a shift in 1976 towards warmer
and wetter conditions in the tropical Pacific, with
widespread climatic and ecological
consequences(1-3). This shift, unique over the past
century(4), has prompted debate over the influence
of increasing atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases on ENSO variability(5-7). Here we
present a 155-year ENSO reconstruction from a
central tropical Pacific coral that provides new
evidence for long-term changes in the regional mean
climate and its variability. A gradual transition in
the early twentieth century and the abrupt change in
1976, both towards warmer and wetter conditions,
co-occur with changes in variability. In the
mid-late nineteenth century, cooler and drier
background conditions coincided with prominent
decadal variability; in the early twentieth century,
shorter-period (similar to2.9 years) variability
intensified. After 1920, variability weakens and
becomes focused at interannual timescales; with the
shift in 1976, variability with a period of about 4
years becomes prominent. Our results suggest that
variability in the tropical Pacific is linked to the
region's mean climate, and that changes in both have
occurred during periods of natural as well as
anthropogenic climate forcing.},

Results from the individual forcing experiments are then linearly combined using a statistically based smoothing procedure to produce sensitivity maps for many target quantities of interest, including the geopotential height response over the Pacific–North American (PNA) region and regional precipitation responses over North America, South America, Africa, Australia, and Indonesia. Perhaps the most striking result from this analysis is that many important targets for seasonal forecasting, including the PNA response, are most sensitive to SST anomalies in the Ni{\~{n}}o-4 region (5°N–5°S, 150°W–160°E) of the central tropical Pacific, with lesser and sometimes opposite s...},

abstract = {Estimates of the climate response to anthropogenic forcing contain irreducible uncertainty due to the presence of internal variability. Accurate quantification of this uncertainty is critical for both contextualizing historical trends and determining the spread of climate projections. The contribution of internal variability to uncertainty in trends can be estimated in models as the spread across an initial condition ensemble. However, internal variability simulated by a modelmay be inconsistent with observations due tomodel biases. Here, statistical resamplingmethods are applied to observations in order to quantify uncertainty in historical 50-yr (1966-2015) winter near-surface air temperature trends over NorthAmerica related to incomplete sampling of internal variability. This estimate is compared with the simulated trend uncertainty in the NCAR CESM1 Large Ensemble (LENS). The comparison suggests that uncertainty in trends due to internal variability is largely overestimated in LENS, which has an average amplification of variability of 32{\%} across NorthAmerica. The amplification of variability is greatest in the westernUnited States and Alaska. The observationally derived estimate of trend uncertainty is combined with the forced signal from LENS to produce an "Observational Large Ensemble" (OLENS). The members of OLENS indicate the range of observationally constrained, spatially consistent temperature trends that could have been observed over the past 50 years if a different sequence of internal variability had unfolded. The smaller trend uncertainty in OLENS suggests that is easier to detect the historical climate change signal in observations than in any given member of LENS.},

Atmospheric teleconnections from the Atlantic contributed to warming over Eurasian high-latitude land surfaces, and El Ni{\~{n}}o-related teleconnections explain warming over southwestern Alaska and British Columbia, while warm anomalies over the central Arctic are associated with physical processes including the presence of enhanced atmospheric water vapor and an increased downwelling longwave radiative flux.

abstract = {We investigate the roles of climate forcings and
chaos (unforced variability) in climate change via
ensembles of climate simulations in which we add
forcings one by one. The experiments suggest that
most interannual climate variability in the period
1979-1996 at middle and high latitudes is
chaotic. But observed SST anomalies, which
themselves are partly forced and partly chaotic,
account for much of the climate variability at low
latitudes and a small portion of the variability at
high latitudes. Both a natural radiative forcing
(volcanic aerosols) and an anthropogenic forcing
(ozone depletion) leave clear signatures in the
simulated climate change that are identified in
observations. Pinatubo aerosols warm the
stratosphere and cool the surface glc:,ally, causing
a tendency for regional surface cooling. Ozone
depletion cools the lower stratosphere, troposphere
and surface, steepening the temperature lapse rate
in the troposphere. Solar irradiance effects are
small, but our model is inadequate to fully explore
this forcing. Well-mixed anthropogenic greenhouse
gases cause a large surface warming that, over the
17 years, approximately offsets cooling by the other
three mechanisms. Thus the net calculated effect of
all measured radiative forcings is approximately
zero surface temperature trend and zero heat storage
in the ocean for the period 1979-1996. Finally, in
addition to the four measured radiative forcings, we
add an initial (1979) disequilibrium forcing of
+0.65 W/m(2). This forcing yields a global surface
warming of about 0.2 degrees C over 1979-1996, close
to observations, and measurable heat storage in the
ocean. We argue that the results represent evidence
of a planetary radiative imbalance of at least 0.5
W/m(2); this disequilibrium presumably represents
unrealized warming due to changes of atmospheric
composition prior to 1979. One implication of the
disequilibrium forcing is an expectation of new
record global temperatures in the next few
years. The best opportunity for observational
confirmation of the disequilibrium is measurement of
ocean temperatures adequate to define heat storage.},

rainfall variability: a drying of the monsoon
regions, related to warming of the tropical oceans,
and variability related to the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation. The latest generation of climate models
partly captures this recent continent-wide drying
trend, attributing it to the combination of
anthropogenic emissions of aerosols and greenhouse
gases, the relative contribution of which is
difficult to quantify with the existing model
archive. The same climate models fail to reach a
robust agreement regarding the twenty-first century
outlook for African rainfall, in a future with
increasing greenhouse gases and decreasing aerosol
loadings. Such uncertainty underscores current
limitations in our understanding of the global
climate system that it is necessary to overcome if
science is to support Africa in meeting its
development goals.},

abstract = {Progress within physical oceanography has been concurrent with the increasing sophistication of tools available for its study. The incorporation of machine learning (ML) techniques offers exciting possibilities for advancing the capacity and speed of established methods and for making substantial and serendipitous discoveries. Beyond vast amounts of complex data ubiquitous in many modern scientific fields, the study of the ocean poses a combination of unique challenges that ML can help address. The observational data available is largely spatially sparse, limited to the surface, and with few time series spanning more than a handful of decades. Important timescales span seconds to millennia, with strong scale interactions and numerical modelling efforts complicated by details such as coastlines. This review covers the current scientific insight offered by applying ML and points to where there is imminent potential. We cover the main three branches of the field: observations, theory, and numerical modelling. Highlighting both challenges and opportunities, we discuss both the historical context and salient ML tools. We focus on the use of ML in situ sampling and satellite observations, and the extent to which ML applications can advance theoretical oceanographic exploration, as well as aid numerical simulations. Applications that are also covered include model error and bias correction and current and potential use within data assimilation. While not without risk, there is great interest in the potential benefits of oceanographic ML applications; this review caters to this interest within the research community.},

The investigation is based on the late twenty-first century over greater North America (20°–90°N, 50°–160°W) using 40 simulations from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble, spanning 1920–2100. AA is found to promote regionally varying ridging aloft (500 hPa) with strong seasonal differences reflecting the location of the strongest surface thermal forcing. During winter, maximum increases in future geopotential heights are centered over the Arctic Ocean, in conjunction with sea ice loss, but minimum height increases (troughing) occur to the south, over the continental United States. During summer the location of maximum height inflation shifts equatorward, forming an annular band across mid-to-high latitudes of the entire Northern Hemisphere.

abstract = {The Arctic is rapidly losing its permanent ice. While increases in greenhouse gases are believed to be the underlying cause of the melting, interactions among the Arctic's changing thermodynamic and dynamic processes driving ice loss are poorly understood. The emission of infrared radiation from the atmosphere to the surface has been recently implicated as an important factor governing the extent of summer perennial sea ice. In this study we use new satellite-derived products to investigate which atmospheric parameters are contributing to observed increases in the downwelling flux in longwave radiation (DLF) during spring in six regions around the periphery of the Arctic Ocean. In areas dominated by low clouds containing liquid water, we find that DLF trends are driven primarily by increasing cloud fraction and more abundant water vapor, and offset by lowering cloud-base heights. In ice-cloud dominated regions (seas north of Siberia), we find that changing water vapor assumes a more important role, while effects of changing cloud fraction and cloud-base height are reduced. Results highlight the need for improved information about Arctic cloud-base heights, cloud phase, and the height and strength of surface-based temperature inversions. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd.},

circulation have occurred since the mid-1970s over

Oscillation (NAG), while the changes over the North

the NAO accounts for 31{\%} of the hemispheric in

anomalies result in part from tropical forcing
associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
phenomenon but with important feedbacks in the
extratropics. The changes in circulation over the
past two decades have resulted in a surface
temperature anomaly pattern of warmth over the

abstract = {Severe drought is the greatest recurring natural disaster to strike
North America. A remarkable network of centuries-long annual tree-ring
chronologies has now allowed for the reconstruction of past drought over
North America covering the past 1000 or more years in most regions.
These reconstructions reveal the occurrence of past ``megadroughts{\{}''{\}}
of unprecedented severity and duration, ones that have never been
experienced by modem societies in North America. There is strong
archaeological evidence for the destabilizing influence of these past
droughts on advanced agricultural societies, examples that should
resonate today given the increasing vulnerability of modem water-based
systems to relatively short-term droughts. Understanding how these
megadroughts develop and persist is a timely scientific problem. Very
recently, climate models have succeeded in simulating all of the major
droughts over North America from the Civil War to the severe 1998-2004
drought in the western U.S. These numerical experiments indicate the
dominating importance of tropical Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures
(SSTs) in determining how much precipitation falls over large parts of
North America. Of central importance to drought formation is the
development of cool ``La Nina-like{\{}''{\}} SSTs in the eastern tropical
Pacific region. This development appears to be partially linked to
changes in radiative forcing over that region, which affects the
Bjerknes feedback mechanism of the ENSO cycle there. Paradoxically,
warmer conditions over the tropical Pacific region lead to the
development of cool La Nina-like SSTs there, which is drought inducing
over North America. Whether or not this process will lead to a greater
prevalence of drought in the future as the world warms due to
accumulating greenhouse gases is unclear at this time. (c) 2007 Elsevier

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The last few years have seen an explosion of interest in extreme event attribution, the science of estimating the influence of human activities or other factors on the probability and other characteristics of an observed extreme weather or climate event. This is driven by public interest, but also has practical applications in decision-making after the event and for raising awareness of current and future climate change impacts. The World Weather Attribution (WWA) collaboration has over the last 5 years developed a methodology to answer these questions in a scientifically rigorous way in the immediate wake of the event when the information is most in demand. This methodology has been developed in the practice of investigating the role of climate change in two dozen extreme events world-wide. In this paper, we highlight the lessons learned through this experience. The methodology itself is documented in a more extensive companion paper. It covers all steps in the attribution process: the event choice and definition, collecting and assessing observations and estimating probability and trends from these, climate model evaluation, estimating modelled hazard trends and their significance, synthesis of the attribution of the hazard, assessment of trends in vulnerability and exposure, and communication. Here, we discuss how each of these steps entails choices that may affect the results, the common problems that can occur and how robust conclusions can (or cannot) be derived from the analysis. Some of these developments also apply to other attribution methodologies and indeed to other problems in climate science.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {New observations and new research have increased our understanding of past, current, and future climate change since the Third U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA3) was published in May 2014. This Climate Science Special Report (CSSR) is designed to capture that new information and build on the existing body of science in order to summarize the current state of knowledge and provide the scientific foundation for the Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4). Since NCA3, stronger evidence has emerged for continuing, rapid, human-caused warming of the global atmosphere and ocean. This report concludes that “it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.” The last few years have also seen record-breaking, climate-related weather extremes, the three warmest years on record for the globe, and continued decline in arctic sea ice. These trends are expected to continue in the future over climate (multidecadal) timescales. Significant advances have also been made in our understanding of extreme weather events and how they relate to increasing global temperatures and associated climate changes. Since 1980, the cost of extreme events for the United States has exceeded {\$}1.1 trillion; therefore, better understanding of the frequency and severity of these events in the context of a changing climate is warranted. Periodically taking stock of the current state of knowledge about climate change and putting new weather extremes, changes in sea ice, increases in ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification into context ensures that rigorous, scientifically-based information is available to inform dialogue and decisions at every level. This climate science report serves as the climate science foundation of the NCA4 and is generally intended for those who have a technical background in climate science. In this Executive Summary, gray boxes present highlights of the main report. These are followed by related points and selected figures providing more scientific details. The summary material on each topic presents the most salient points of chapter findings and therefore represents only a subset of the report's content. For more details, the reader is referred to the individual chapters. This report discusses climate trends and findings at several scales: global, nationwide for the United States, and for ten specific U.S. regions (shown in Figure 1 in the Guide to the Report). A statement of scientific confidence also follows each point in the Executive Summary. The confidence scale is described in the Guide to the Report. At the end of the Executive Summary and in Chapter 1: Our Globally Changing Climate, there is also a summary box highlighting the most notable advances and topics since NCA3 and since the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report.},

However, a consensus is emerging that the underlying causes and future dynamics of so-called Arctic greening and browning trends are more complex, variable and inherently scale-dependent than previously thought. Here we summarize the complexities of observing and interpreting high-latitude greening to identify priorities for future research. Incorporating satellite and proximal remote sensing with in-situ data, while accounting for uncertainties and scale issues, will advance the study of past, present and future Arctic vegetation change. As tundra ecosystems respond to rapid Arctic warming, satellite records suggest a widespread greening.

abstract = {Observational studies and model experiments make
abundantly clear the need for a global perspective
in order to understand the nature and causes of
persistent regional precipitation
anomalies. Rainfall in the deep tropics is
particularly important as a forcing mechanism for
the atmosphere's large-scale circulation and
climate. Analysis of systematic space-based
observations and surface marine data over the past
three decades has vastly improved our understanding
of tropical convective regimes and their
relationship to surface conditions. The
characteristics of the annual cycle of tropical
convection and its relationship to sea surface
temperature field and the general circulation of the
tropics are reviewed. The hierarchal nature of
tropical precipitation variability on time/space
scales ranging from synoptic cloud clusters through
the intraseasonal Madden-Julian Oscillation to
multiyear El Nino-Southern Oscillation cycle is
discussed. Links between tropical convection and
extratropical precipitation on time scales ranging
from synoptic to multiyear are examined, with
emphasis on conditions over the North Pacific-North
American sector during winter. Precipitation
variability over a number of regions bordering the
Atlantic basin are related to Atlantic sector modes
of SST and circulation variability. Systematic modes
of Atlantic variability and their relationship to
regional precipitation variability are described
with emphasis on the tropics. Changes in landscape
characteristics (vegetative cover, soil moisture,
surface roughness), whether natural or human
induced, result in changes in the surface radiation
balance and the fluxes of heat and moisture. Our
current understanding of the role of land surface
processes in sustaining or intensifying anomalous
precipitation regimes is briefly
discussed. Identification of an anthropogenic trend
in the presence of decadal-scale natural variations
in precipitation is a formidable challenge. Three
examples of large-amplitude secular variations in
regional precipitation regimes (Sahel, North
American Great Plains, and India) are discussed in
terms of possible forcing mechanisms. Continuous
global monitoring of precipitation is a challenging
task. Satellite-based observations, in conjunction
with effective use of surface-based ''ground truth''
data and further development of four-dimensional
data assimilation methodology, offer the only
realistic prospects for significant improvement in
the monitoring and quantification of global
precipitation. Current methods for estimating
precipitation from space-based observations are
described and an overview of the upcoming Tropical
Rainfall Measurement Mission is included.},

However, the distinctive role of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and its underlying dynamics in controlling the rapid transition remains debatable, since it is difficult to isolate the sole effect of the IOD using observation. By conducting model experiments, this study demonstrated that the positive IOD cases could contribute to the rapid phase transition from El Ni{\~{n}}o to La Ni{\~{n}}a without the assistance of the Indian Ocean Basin–wide Mode. The westerly wind anomalies over the tropical western Pacific induced not only the El Ni{\~{n}}o phase via descending Kelvin waves in the equatorial eastern Pacific but also the SST cooling in the off-equatorial western Pacific via ascending Rossby waves. The positive feedback between the upwelling Rossby waves and cool SST maintained the Philippine Sea anticyclone anomalies. The accompanying easterly wind anomalies over the tropical western Pacific triggered upwelling oceanic Kelvin waves, leading to the occurrence of La Ni{\~{n}}a. This study shows the possible role of the IOD in the rapid phase transition of ENSO.},

However, it remains unclear whether these observed links are causal, and model experiments suggest that they might not be. Here we apply two independent approaches to infer causality from observations and climate models and to reconcile these sources of data. Models capture the observed correlations between reduced sea ice and cold mid-latitude winters, but only when reduced sea ice coincides with anomalous heat transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean, implying that the atmosphere is driving the loss. Causal inference from the physics-based approach is corroborated by a lead–lag analysis, showing that circulation-driven temperature anomalies precede, but do not follow, reduced sea ice. Furthermore, no mid-latitude cooling is found in modelling experiments with imposed future sea-ice loss. Our results show robust support for anomalous atmospheric circulation simultaneously driving cold mid-latitude winters and mild Arctic conditions, and reduced sea ice having a minimal influence on severe mid-latitude winters.},

abstract = {Partitioning uncertainty in projections of future climate change into contributions from internal variability, model response uncertainty, and emissions scenarios has historically relied on making assumptions about forced changes in the mean and variability. With the advent of multiple Single-Model Initial-Condition Large Ensembles (SMILEs), these assumptions can be scrutinized, as they allow a more robust separation between sources of uncertainty. Here, the iconic framework from Hawkins and Sutton (2009) for uncertainty partitioning is revisited for temperature and precipitation projections using seven SMILEs and the Climate Model Intercomparison Projects CMIP5 and CMIP6 archives. The original approach is shown to work well at global scales (potential method error {\textless}20{\%}), while at local to regional scales such as British Isles temperature or Sahel precipitation, there is a notable potential method error (up to 50{\%}) and more accurate partitioning of uncertainty is achieved through the use of SMILEs. Whenever internal variability and forced changes therein are important, the need to evaluate and improve the representation of variability in models is evident. The available SMILEs are shown to be a good representation of the CMIP5 model diversity in many situations, making them a useful tool for interpreting CMIP5. CMIP6 often shows larger absolute and relative model uncertainty than CMIP5, although part of this difference can be reconciled with the higher average transient climate response in CMIP6. This study demonstrates the added value of a collection of SMILEs for quantifying and diagnosing uncertainty in climate projections.},

abstract = {The sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) constitutes the latest update on expected future climate change based on a new generation of climate models. To extract reliable estimates of future warming and related uncertainties from these models, the spread in their projections is often translated into probabilistic estimates such as the mean and likely range. Here, we use a model weighting approach, which accounts for the models' historical performance based on several diagnostics as well as model interdependence within the CMIP6 ensemble, to calculate constrained distributions of global mean temperature change. We investigate the skill of our approach in a perfect model test, where we use previous-generation CMIP5 models as pseudo-observations in the historical period. The performance of the distribution weighted in the abovementioned manner with respect to matching the pseudo-observations in the future is then evaluated, and we find a mean increase in skill of about 17{\%} compared with the unweighted distribution. In addition, we show that our independence metric correctly clusters models known to be similar based on a CMIP6 "family tree", which enables the application of a weighting based on the degree of inter-model dependence. We then apply the weighting approach, based on two observational estimates (the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Retrospective Analysis-ERA5, and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2-MERRA-2), to constrain CMIP6 projections under weak (SSP1-2.6) and strong (SSP5-8.5) climate change scenarios (SSP refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). Our results show a reduction in the projected mean warming for both scenarios because some CMIP6 models with high future warming receive systematically lower performance weights. The mean of end-of-century warming (2081-2100 relative to 1995-2014) for SSP5-8.5 with weighting is 3.7g C, compared with 4.1gC without weighting; the likely (66{\%}) uncertainty range is 3.1 to 4.6gC, which equates to a 13{\%} decrease in spread. For SSP1-2.6, the weighted end-of-century warming is 1gC (0.7 to 1.4gC), which results in a reduction of-0.1 gC in the mean and-24 {\%} in the likely range compared with the unweighted case.},

abstract = {Internal atmospheric variability fundamentally limits predictability of climate and obscures evidence of anthropogenic climate change regionally and on time scales of up to a few decades. Dynamical adjustment techniques estimate and subsequently remove the influence of atmospheric circulation variability on temperature or precipitation. The residual component is expected to contain the thermodynamical signal of the externally forced response but with less circulation-induced noise. Existing techniques have led to important insights into recent trends in regional (hydro-) climate and their drivers, but the variance explained by circulation is often low. Here, we develop a novel dynamical adjustment technique by implementing principles from statistical learning. We demonstrate in an ensemble of Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulations that statistical learning methods, such as regularized linear models, establish a clearer relationship between circulation variability and atmospheric target variables, and need relatively short periods of record for training (around 30 years). The method accounts for, on average, 83{\%} and 78{\%} of European monthly winter temperature and precipitation variability at gridcell level, and around 80{\%} of global mean temperature and hemispheric precipitation variability. We show that the residuals retain forced thermodynamical contributions to temperature and precipitation variability. Accurate estimates of the total forced response can thus be recovered assuming that forced circulation changes are gradual over time. Overall, forced climate response estimates can be extracted at regional or global scales from approximately 3–5 times fewer ensemble members, or even a single realization, using statistical learning techniques. We anticipate the technique will contribute to reducing uncertainties around internal variability and facilitating climate change detection and attribution.},

Merging weather and climate prediction with Earth-system science is a new challenge that is of considerable scientific interest and societal relevance. There is increased societal interest in climate information for the next few decades to guide adaptation strategies. Initialized climate forecasts and scenario integrations with climate models can generate relevant climate information. Advances have been made to increase the prediction horizon of initialized forecasts to decades. The quality of long-term predictions relies on accurate simulation of slow components of the Earth system, accurate simulation of interactions between fast and slow processes in the Earth system, and the initialization procedures. The prediction problem lies at the heart of NWP. Hence, scientists working on decadal predictions can learn from experiences in initialization, perturbation, and verification in short-term-to-seasonal forecasting. Also, joint model development in NWP and Earth-system modeling can be mutually beneficial. Atmospheric model development is generally more advanced in NWP than in ESMs and new developments can also be implemented in Earth-system models. Conversely, NWP models increasingly include Earth-system components. These include modules of atmospheric composition and the land surface that are generally developed by Earth-system modeling groups.

abstract = {A 245-year coral oxygen isotope record from the
northern Red Sea (Ras Umm Sidd/Egypt, similar to 28
degreesN) in bimonthly resolution is presented. The
mean annual coral delta O-18 signal apparently
reflects varying proportions of both sea surface
temperature and delta O-18(seawater) variability. In
conjunction with instrumental observations of
climate the coral record suggests for interannual
and longer timescales that colder periods are
accompanied by more arid conditions in the northern
Red Sea but increased rainfall in the southeastern
Mediterranean, whereas warmer periods are
accompanied by decreased rainfall in the latter and
less arid conditions in the northern Red Sea. A
similar to 70-year oscillation of probably North
Atlantic origin dominates the coral time
series. Interannual to interdecadal variability is
correlated with instrumental indices of the North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO), and North Pacific climate
variability. The results suggest that these modes
contributed consistently to Middle East climate
variability since at least 1750, preferentially at a
period of similar to5.7 years.},

@article{seager03,
abstract = {Inspired by paleoclimate evidence that much past
climate change has been symmetric about the equator,
the causes of hemispherically symmetric variability
in the recent observational record are examined
using the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction - National Center for Atmospheric
Research reanalysis dataset and numerical models. It
was found that the dominant cause of hemispherically
symmetric variability is the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation. During an El Nino event the Tropics
warm at all longitudes and the subtropical jets in
both hemispheres strengthen on their equatorward
flanks. Poleward of the tropical warming there are
latitude belts of marked cooling, extending from the
surface to the tropopause in both hemispheres, at
all longitudes and in all seasons. The midlatitude
cooling is caused by changes in the eddy-driven mean
meridional circulation. Changes in the transient
eddy momentum fluxes during an El Nino event force
upper-tropospheric ascent in midlatitudes through a
balance between the eddy fluxes and the Coriolis
torque. The eddy-driven ascent causes anomalous
adiabatic cooling, which is primarily balanced by
anomalous diabatic heating. Using a quasigeostrophic
spherical model, forced by an imposed surface eddy
disturbance of chosen wavenumber and frequency, it
is shown that the anomalous eddy momentum fluxes are
caused by the impact that the changes in the
tropically forced subtropical jets have on the
propagation in the latitude - height plane of
transient eddies. Changes in zonal winds, and
associated changes in the meridional gradient of
potential vorticity, create an anomalous region of
low meridional wavenumber in the midlatitudes that
refracts waves away both poleward and
equatorward. Tropical forcing of variability in the
eddy-driven mean meridional circulation is another
way, in addition to Rossby wave teleconnections,
whereby the Tropics can influence extratropical
climate. Unlike teleconnections this mechanism
causes climate variability that has strong zonally
and hemispherically symmetric components and
operates throughout the seasonal cycle.},

Assuming bias in TAS has stabilized in the 10 year predictions, after bias adjustment, TAS anomalies for the 2016-2035 period in the 30 year predictions initialized in 2006 are about 16{\%} less than the uninitialized projections. One contributing factor for the improved climate simulation is the bias adjustment, which corrects the models' systematic errors and higher-than-observed decadal warming trend. Another important factor is the initialization with observations which constrains the ocean such that the starting points of the initialized simulations are close to the observed initial states.

abstract = {Observations and simulations link anthropogenic
greenhouse and aerosol emissions with rapidly
increasing Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures
(SSTs). Over the past 60 years, the Indian Ocean
warmed two to three times faster than the central
tropical Pacific, extending the tropical warm pool
to the west by similar to 40A degrees longitude ({\textgreater}
4,000 km). This propensity toward rapid warming in
the Indian Ocean has been the dominant mode of
interannual variability among SSTs throughout the
tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans (55A degrees
E-140A degrees W) since at least 1948, explaining
more variance than anomalies associated with the El
Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In the atmosphere,
the primary mode of variability has been a
corresponding trend toward greatly increased
convection and precipitation over the tropical
Indian Ocean. The temperature and rainfall increases
in this region have produced a westward extension of
the western, ascending branch of the atmospheric
Walker circulation. Diabatic heating due to
increased mid-tropospheric water vapor condensation
elicits a westward atmospheric response that sends
an easterly flow of dry air aloft toward eastern
Africa. In recent decades (1980-2009), this response
has suppressed convection over tropical eastern
Africa, decreasing precipitation during the
'long-rains' season of March-June. This trend toward
drought contrasts with projections of increased
rainfall in eastern Africa and more 'El Nio-like'
conditions globally by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change. Increased Indian Ocean SSTs
appear likely to continue to strongly modulate the
Warm Pool circulation, reducing precipitation in
eastern Africa, regardless of whether the projected
trend in ENSO is realized. These results have
important food security implications, informing
agricultural development, environmental
conservation, and water resource planning.},

abstract = {Over the past 30 years, methyl bromide (MBr), a broad spectrum fumigant, has been used extensively for soilborne disease and pest control in the production of many fruit, vegetable, turf, and nursery crops. Recently, agricultural emissions of MBr were implicated as a potentially significant contributor to stratospheric ozone depletion. As a precautionary measure for global ozone protection, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has enforced federal legislation which mandates a complete phase-out of MBr use within the United States by 1 January 2001. Thus, new cost effective, environmentally compatible strategies for control of nematodes and other soilborne pests and pathogens must be developed and tested in a relatively short time to avoid significant losses in crop productivity. The extent to which certain agricultural industries that are now heavily reliant on MBr are affected will depend on the development of sustainable, integrated tactics to pest control, such as combinations of cultural, chemical, and biological tactics. New muhidisciplinary research and extension programs must be developed to address and overcome major constraints and incompatibilities that have prevented such tactics from being widely adopted.},

climatic processes are intimately coupled, so that
understanding variability at any one timescale

the Earth's surface temperature illustrate this
interdependence, having a continuum of variability
following a power-law scaling(1-7). But although
specific modes of interannual variability are
relatively well understood(8,9), the general
controls on continuum variability are uncertain and
usually described as purely stochastic
processes(10-13). Here we show that power-law
relationships of surface temperature variability
scale with annual and Milankovitch-period (23,000-
and 41,000- year) cycles. The annual cycle
corresponds to scaling at monthly to decadal
periods, while millennial and longer periods are
tied to the Milankovitch cycles. Thus the annual,
Milankovitch and continuum temperature variability
together represent the response to deterministic
insolation forcing. The identification of a
deterministic control on the continuum provides
insight into the mechanisms governing interannual

Here, we show that the multimodel mean AMOC strengthened by approximately 10{\%} from 1850–1985 in new simulations from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), a larger change than was seen in CMIP5. Across the models, the strength of the AMOC trend up to 1985 is related to a proxy for the strength of the aerosol forcing. Therefore, the multimodel difference is a result of stronger anthropogenic aerosol forcing on average in CMIP6 than CMIP5, which is primarily due to more models including aerosol-cloud interactions. However, observational constraints—including a historical sea surface temperature fingerprint and shortwave radiative forcing in recent decades—suggest that anthropogenic forcing and/or the AMOC response may be overestimated.},

abstract = {Despite the observed monotonic increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations, global mean temperature displays important decadal fluctuations typically attributed to both external forcing and internal variability. Here, we provide a robust quantification of the relative contributions of anthropogenic, natural, and internally-driven decadal variability of global mean sea surface temperature (GMSST) by using a unique dataset consisting of 30-member large initial-condition ensembles with five Earth System Models (ESM-LE). We present evidence that a large fraction ({\~{}}29–53{\%}) of the simulated decadal-scale variance in individual timeseries of GMSST over 1950–2010 is externally forced and largely linked to the representation of volcanic aerosols. Comparison with the future (2010–2070) period suggests that external forcing provides a source of additional decadal-scale variability in the historical period. Given the unpredictable nature of future volcanic aerosol forcing, it is suggested that a large portion of decadal GMSST variability might not be predictable. Global mean sea surface surface temperature shows decadal fluctuations superimposed to the warming trend whose causes are still debated. Here, the authors provide a quantification of relative contributions of different drivers and conclude that both internal and externally-forced variability play a comparable role.},

associated with a well known pattern of Pacific

abstract = {A defining feature of Pacific decadal ENSO-like
variability is the similarity between its spatial
expression in sea surface temperature (SST) and the
spatial structure of interannual ENSO
variability. This similarity may indicate that the
decadal variability is merely a long-term average
over interannual ENSO variability. In contrast,
subtle differences (namely the meridionally
broadened tropical SST signature and emphasized
midlatitude SST anomalies for the decadal ENSO-like
pattern) may indicate that fundamentally different
processes are responsible for generating variability
on the decadal to interdecadal time scale. The
present study attempts to reconcile the subtly
different spatial structures of interannual ENSO and
decadal ENSO-like variability by relating the
decadal pattern to various SST patterns associated
with the development of the interannual ENSO
cycle. First, a statistical analysis is used to
reconstruct the decadal ENSO-like SST pattern as a
linear combination of interannual SST patterns. It
is shown that the decadal ENSO-like pattern is well
reconstructed in the absence of decadal spatial
information. Next, these interannual patterns are
physically interpreted in relation to the
interannual ENSO cycle. The analysis reveals that
the decadal ENSO-like SST pattern is obtained by
averaging over three SST patterns associated with
ENSO precursors, the peak of an ENSO event, and ENSO
"leftovers." The study provides a plausible
physical explanation for the spatial structure of
ENSO-like decadal variability as an average over
variations in the interannual ENSO cycle. The
results indicate that the prominent spatial features
of decadal ENSO-like variability are generated by
physical mechanisms that operate through the
interannual ENSO cycle. This does not imply,
however, that decadal processes are unimportant in
altering the decadal properties of ENSO. Results may
provide a framework for interpreting modeled decadal
ENSO-like variability and for constraining plausible
mechanisms of tropical decadal variability.},

abstract = {Global mean surface and tropospheric temperatures have shown slower warming since 1998 than found in climate model simulations. A detailed analysis of observations and climate model simulations suggests that the observed influence of volcanic eruptions on tropospheric temperature has been significant, and that the discrepancy between climate simulations and observations is reduced by up to 15{\%} when twenty-first century volcanic eruptions are accounted for in the models. Despite continued growth in atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases, global mean surface and tropospheric temperatures have shown slower warming since 1998 than previously1,2,3,4,5. Possible explanations for the slow-down include internal climate variability3,4,6,7, external cooling influences1,2,4,8,9,10,11 and observational errors12,13. Several recent modelling studies have examined the contribution of early twenty-first-century volcanic eruptions1,2,4,8 to the muted surface warming. Here we present a detailed analysis of the impact of recent volcanic forcing on tropospheric temperature, based on observations as well as climate model simulations. We identify statistically significant correlations between observations of stratospheric aerosol optical depth and satellite-based estimates of both tropospheric temperature and short-wave fluxes at the top of the atmosphere. We show that climate model simulations without the effects of early twenty-first-century volcanic eruptions overestimate the tropospheric warming observed since 1998. In two simulations with more realistic volcanic influences following the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, differences between simulated and observed tropospheric temperature trends over the period 1998 to 2012 are up to 15{\%} smaller, with large uncertainties in the magnitude of the effect. To reduce these uncertainties, better observations of eruption-specific properties of volcanic aerosols are needed, as well as improved representation of these eruption-specific properties in climate model simulations.},

abstract = {The future climate projections in the IPCC reports are visually communicated via maps showing the mean response of climate models to alternative scenarios of socio-economic development. The presence of large changes is highlighted by stippling the maps where the mean climate response (the signal) is large compared to internal variability (the noise) and the response is robust, that is, consistent in sign, across the individual models. In addition, hatching is used to mark the regions with a small multi-model mean change. This approach may fail to recognize the risk of large changes in regions where the uncertainty is large and the response is not robust. Here, we present a more informative diagnostic to support risk assessment that is obtained by quantifying the mean forced signal-to-noise ratio of the individual model responses, rather than the signal-to-noise ratio of the mean response. This enables us to identify regions where a large future change compared to year-to-year variability is plausible, regardless of whether the signal is robust across the ensemble. For mean precipitation changes, we find that the majority (58{\%} in surface area) of the unmarked regions and a sizeable portion (19{\%}) of the hatched regions from the AR5 projections hid climate change responses to the RCP8.5 scenario that are on average large compared to the year-to-year variability. Based on the newer CMIP6 ensemble, a considerable potential for large annual-mean precipitation changes, despite the lack of a robust multi-model projection, exists over 22{\%} of the surface land area, particularly in Central America, northern South America (including the Amazon), Central and West Africa (including parts of the Sahel), and the Maritime Continent.},

Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.},

abstract = {Abstract A multi-millenial simulation with a coupled
atmospheric-oceanic climatic model has been used to
investigate the occurrence rate and characteristics
of multi-year dry and pluvial episodes. Such
episodes are defined as having the same sign
rainfall anomalies for the whole of their
durations. Episodes of 5-, 8- and 10-year durations
are shown to occur all over the globe. The
occurrence rates are approximately in agreement with
probabilistic expectations, although there are
spatial variations associated with El Nino Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) influences. The impacts of the
dry and pluvial episodes are considerable, with
10-year duration dry episodes resulting in a loss of
at least one year's rainfall over the oceans and
much larger losses over arid regions. Similar but
positive outcomes are associated with pluvial
episodes. Accumulated rainfall anomalies over
various multi-decadal periods indicate that regions
with persistent features can occur, implying longer
term impacts than might have been expected from a
succession of dry and pluvial episodes. Time series
of these episodes for individual model gridboxes
highlight a disparity between the occurrence rates
of dry and pluvial episodes and the lack of
synchronicity of these episodes at the various
gridboxes. These time series also clearly illustrate
the rapid fall-off in the occurrence rates of the
episodes as their durations are increased. Despite
claims in the literature that `megadroughts' are
typically associated with extended ENSO events, it
is shown that for a very extended La Nina event the
rainfall anomalies in a number of ENSO-sensitive
regions experienced interannual variability rather
than a persistent anomaly. The role of a number of
large-scale oscillations in generating rainfall
anomalies is examined, but it is concluded that
stochastic processes are needed to account for the
extended duration of dry and pluvial episodes, in
addition to any forcing associated with such
oscillations. This adds a random aspect to the
determination of whether any given, say, ENSO event
will become a dry or pluvial episode.},

From February to May, the new ice forming in wind-driven coastal polynyas grows to a thickness approximately equal to the climatological thickness loss due to summer thermodynamic processes. Estimating the area of sea ice that is preconditioned to melt enables seasonal predictability of the minimum SIE. Wintertime ice motion is quantified by seeding passive tracers along the coastlines and advecting them with the Lagrangian Ice Tracking System (LITS) forced with sea ice drifts from the Polar Pathfinder dataset for years 1992-2016. LITS-derived landfast ice estimates are comparable to those of the Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute ice charts. Time series of the minimum SIE and coastal divergence show trends of -24.2{\%} and +31.3{\%} per decade, respectively. Statistically significant correlation (r = -0.63) between anomalies of coastal divergence and the following September SIE occurs for coastal divergence integrated from February to the beginning of May. Using the coastal divergence anomaly to predict the minimum SIE departure from the trend improves the explained variance by 21{\%} compared to hindcasts based on persistence of the linear trend. Coastal divergence anomalies correlate with the winter mean Arctic Oscillation index (r = 0.69). LITS-derived areas of coastal divergence tend to underestimate the total area covered by thin ice in the CryoSat-2/SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) thickness dataset, as suggested by a thermodynamic sea ice growth model.},

abstract = {Despite a steady increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), global-mean surface temperature (T) has shown no discernible warming since about 2000, in sharp contrast to model simulations, which on average project strong warming 1-3. The recent slowdown in observed surface warming has been attributed to decadal cooling in the tropical Pacific 1,4,5 , intensifying trade winds 5 , changes in El Ni{\~{n}}o activity 6,7 , increasing volcanic activity 8-10 and decreasing solar irradiance 7. Earlier periods of arrested warming have been observed but received much less attention than the recent period, and their causes are poorly understood. Here we analyse observed and model-simulated global T fields to quantify the contributions of internal climate variability (ICV) to decadal changes in global-mean T since 1920. We show that the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) has been associated with large T anomalies over both ocean and land. Combined with another leading mode of ICV, the IPO explains most of the diierence between observed and model-simulated rates of decadal change in global-mean T since 1920, and particularly over the so-called 'hiatus' period since about 2000. We conclude that ICV, mainly through the IPO, was largely responsible for the recent slowdown, as well as for earlier slowdowns and accelerations in global-mean T since 1920, with preferred spatial patterns diierent from those associated with GHG-induced warming or aerosol-induced cooling. Recent history suggests that the IPO could reverse course and lead to accelerated global warming in the coming decades. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO; refs 11,12), or more generally the IPO (refs 13,14), switched from a warm phase to a cold phase around 1999 15. This switch has been associated with a cooling trend since the early 1990s over the Equatorial Central and Eastern Pacific (ECEP; 15 • S-15 • N, 180 •-80 • W) that has contributed to the recent hiatus in global-mean T (refs 4,5). Modelling studies 1,16,17 have also shown that the IPO can modulate the rate of global warming through changes in ocean heat uptake. Given the well-documented extra-tropical response to tropical forcings 18,19 , it is not surprising that IPO-associated sea surface temperature (SST) variations in the ECEP have had a large impact on global-mean T (ref. 1). The recent cooling of the ECEP has been accompanied by strengthening trade winds 5 and increasing ocean heat uptake 4,16,17,20 , typical of a La Ni{\~{n}}a event 21 but over decadal timescales. Although these studies all point to a major contribution of the ECEP to the recent global warming slowdown, it is unclear how much of the observed SST change in the ECEP is associated with ICV, particularly the IPO, and how much is due to external forcing change, such as stratospheric aerosols 7-10.

abstract = {Maize was domesticated more than 6,000 years ago in
central Mexico, and remains a vital staple food and
cultural symbol in Mesoamerica. Maize yield in the
central highlands is strongly dependant on adequate
rainfall early in the growing season (April-June)
because late maturation of the crop may result in
damage from autumn frost. Climate-induced crop
failures with profound socioeconomic impacts have
punctuated Mexican history. However, reliable
records of maize harvest have not been available
until very recently, and historical records of crop
yield and price are discontinuous and can be
difficult to interpret. We have developed a
continuous, exactly dated, tree-ring reconstruction
of maize yield variability in central Mexico from
1474 to 2001 that provides new insight into the
history of climate and food availability in the
heartland of the Mesoamerican cultural province. The
reconstruction indicates that seven of the most
severe agricultural crises in Mexican history
occurred during decadal-scale episodes of
reconstructed maize shortfalls.},

In comparison with the September sea-ice extent, the September sea-ice volume has larger spread in the historical simulation but faster convergence in the projection simulation, especially in the context of increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This indicates that the ice volume might be more sensitive to external forcings than the ice extent. Using the averaged projection of those climate models from the 30 CMIP5 models that can better reflect the ‘observed' sea-ice volume climatology and variability, it is shown that the September sea ice volume will decrease to {\~{}}3000 km3 in the early 2060s, and then level off under a medium-mitigation scenario.

regional-scale mortality of overstory trees, which

months of depleted soil water content, {\textgreater}90{\%} of the

a remotely sensed index of vegetation greenness

at the intensively studied site but also across the
region, extending over 12,000 km(2) or more; aerial
and field surveys confirmed the general extent of
the die-off. Notably, the recent drought was warmer
than the previous subcontinental drought of the
1950s. The limited, available observations suggest
that die-off from the recent drought was more
extensive than that from the previous drought,
extending into wetter sites within the tree species'

to rapid, drought-induced die-off of overstory woody

Recent droughts with broad impacts over the conterminous U.S. (1996, 1999-2002) were associated with North Atlantic warming (positive AMO) and northeastern and tropical Pacific cooling (negative PDO). Much of the long-term predictability of drought frequency may reside in the multidecadal behavior of the North Atlantic Ocean. Should the current positive AMO (warm North Atlantic) conditions persist into the upcoming decade, we suggest two possible drought scenarios that resemble the continental-scale patterns of the 1930s (positive PDO) and 1950s (negative PDO) drought.},

However, even as temperatures stabilize, sea level would continue to rise. With little mitigation, future sea-level rise would be large and continue unabated for centuries. Though sea-level rise cannot be stopped for at least the next several hundred years, with aggressive mitigation it can be slowed down, and this would buy time for adaptation measures to be adopted.},

The uncertainty of the estimated ToE is specifically investigated by using three SMILEs to estimate the ICV. The results show that using 1921-40 as a baseline period, the annual mean precipitation ACC is expected to emerge within this century over extratropical regions as well as along the equatorial band. However, ToEs are unlikely to occur, even by the end of this century, over intratropical regions outside of the equatorial band. In contrast, annual mean temperature ACC has already emerged from the temperature ICV for most of the globe. Similar spatial patterns are observed at the seasonal scale, while a weaker ACC for boreal summer (June-August) precipitation and additional ICV for boreal winter (December-February) temperature translate to later ToEs for some regions. In addition, the uncertainty of ToE related to the choice of a SMILE is mostly less than 20 years for annual mean precipitation and temperature. However, it can be as large as 90 years for annual mean precipitation over some regions. Overall, results indicate that the choice of a SMILE is a significant source of uncertainty in the estimation of ToE and results based on only one SMILE should be interpreted with caution.},

Statistical analyses of observations show that enhanced poleward moisture transport from the North Pacific to the Arctic Ocean contributed to the accelerated SIA decrease during the most recent period. As a consequence, specific humidity in the Arctic Pacific sector significantly increased along with an increase of downward longwave radiation beginning in 2002, which led to a significant acceleration in the decline of SIA in the Arctic Pacific sector. The resulting sea ice loss lead to increased evaporation in the Arctic Ocean resulting in a further increase of the specific humidity in mid-to-late fall, thus acting as a positive feedback to the sea ice loss.

abstract = {This study investigates global surface temperature data since 1920, and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation is found to be largely responsible for temperature fluctuations, exhibiting different spatial patterns to anthropogenic temperature drivers. Despite a steady increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), global-mean surface temperature (T) has shown no discernible warming since about 2000, in sharp contrast to model simulations, which on average project strong warming1,2,3. The recent slowdown in observed surface warming has been attributed to decadal cooling in the tropical Pacific1,4,5, intensifying trade winds5, changes in El Ni{\~{n}}o activity6,7, increasing volcanic activity8,9,10 and decreasing solar irradiance7. Earlier periods of arrested warming have been observed but received much less attention than the recent period, and their causes are poorly understood. Here we analyse observed and model-simulated global T fields to quantify the contributions of internal climate variability (ICV) to decadal changes in global-mean T since 1920. We show that the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) has been associated with large T anomalies over both ocean and land. Combined with another leading mode of ICV, the IPO explains most of the difference between observed and model-simulated rates of decadal change in global-mean T since 1920, and particularly over the so-called ‘hiatus' period since about 2000. We conclude that ICV, mainly through the IPO, was largely responsible for the recent slowdown, as well as for earlier slowdowns and accelerations in global-mean T since 1920, with preferred spatial patterns different from those associated with GHG-induced warming or aerosol-induced cooling. Recent history suggests that the IPO could reverse course and lead to accelerated global warming in the coming decades.},

abstract = {With amplified warming and record sea ice loss, the Arctic is the canary of global warming. The historical Arctic warming is poorly understood, limiting our confidence in model projections. Specifically, Arctic surface air temperature increased rapidly over the early 20th century, at rates comparable to those of recent decades despite much weaker greenhouse gas forcing. Here, we show that the concurrent phase shift of Pacific and Atlantic interdecadal variability modes is the major driver for the rapid early 20thcentury Arctic warming. Atmospheric model simulations successfully reproduce the early Arctic warming when the interdecadal variability of sea surface temperature (SST) is properly prescribed. The early 20th-century Arctic warming is associated with positive SST anomalies over the tropical and North Atlantic and a Pacific SST pattern reminiscent of the positive phase of the Pacific decadal oscillation. Atmospheric circulation changes are important for the early 20th-century Arctic warming. The equatorial Pacific warming deepens the Aleutian low, advecting warm air into the North American Arctic. The extratropical North Atlantic and North Pacific SST warming strengthens surface westerly winds over northern Eurasia, intensifying the warming there. Coupled ocean-Atmosphere simulations support the constructive intensification of Arctic warming by a concurrent, negative-To-positive phase shift of the Pacific and Atlantic interdecadal modes. Our results aid attributing the historical Arctic warming and thereby constrain the amplified warming projected for this important region.},

Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between 740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago (Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long--28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future.},

abstract = {We used a simulated data set of hydro-climatological
variables to examine for 20th century trends in soil
moisture, runoff, and drought characteristics over
the conterminous United States (U.S.). An increasing
trend is apparent in both model soil moisture and
runoff over much of the U. S., with a few decreasing
trends in parts of the Southwest. The trend patterns
were qualitatively similar to those found in
streamflow records observed at a station network
minimally affected by anthropogenic activities. This
wetting trend is consistent with the general
increase in precipitation in the latter half of the
20th century. Droughts have, for the most part,
become shorter, less frequent, and cover a smaller
portion of the country over the last century. The
main exception is the Southwest and parts of the
interior of the West, where, notwithstanding
increased precipitation (and in some cases increased
soil moisture and runoff), increased temperature has
led to trends in drought characteristics that are
mostly opposite to those for the rest of the country
especially in the case of drought duration and
severity, which have increased.},

abstract = {The multi-channel satellite passive-microwave record of Earth's sea ice coverage, extending back to the late 1970s, has long revealed declining sea ice coverage in the Arctic but through 2015 revealed an overall increase rather than decrease in Antarctic sea ice coverage. Following major decreases in Antarctic sea ice since 2015, the 42-year 1979–2020 satellite dataset now shows recent losses in sea ice coverage in both hemispheres, and this is convincingly demonstrated by the enumeration of monthly and yearly record high and record low sea ice extents experienced over the course of the 42 years. In fact, one of the most convincing statistics on the declining Arctic sea ice cover is the fact that since 1986 the Arctic has not experienced a single monthly record high sea ice extent in any month but has experienced 93 monthly record lows. In contrast, all 12 calendar months have their 42-year Antarctic monthly record high sea ice extents in the period 2007–2015, while 8 of the 12 calendar months have had Antarctic record lows since 2015. Globally, every calendar month has registered a new monthly record low within the past 5 years. These results are complemented (and somewhat tempered) by quantification of the range of monthly and yearly sea ice extent values over the 42 years. For instance, although the Arctic's lowest September monthly average sea ice extent (in 2012) is 53{\%} lower than its highest September monthly average sea ice extent (in 1980), the other months have far smaller percent differences between their lowest and highest Arctic values. For yearly average sea ice extents, the Arctic's lowest value (in 2020) is 18{\%} lower than its highest value (in 1982), the Antarctic's lowest value (in 2017) is 16{\%} lower than its highest value (in 2014), and the global lowest value (in 2019) is only 12{\%} lower than its highest value (in 1982).},

abstract = {Climate models have continued to be developed and improved since the AR4, and many models have been extended into Earth System models by including the representation of biogeochemical cycles important to climate change. These models allow for policy-relevant calculations such as the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions compatible with a specified climate stabilization target. In addition, the range of climate variables and processes that have been evaluated has greatly expanded, and differences between models and observations are increasingly quantified using ‘performance metrics'. In this chapter, model evaluation covers simulation of the mean climate, of historical climate change, of variability on multiple time scales and of regional modes of variability. This evaluation is based on recent internationally coordinated model experiments, including simulations of historic and paleo climate, specialized experiments designed to provide insight into key climate processes and feedbacks and regional climate downscaling. Figure 9.44 provides an overview of model capabilities as assessed in this chapter, including improvements, or lack thereof, relative to models assessed in the AR4. The chapter concludes with an assessment of recent work connecting model performance to the detection and attribution of climate change as well as to future projections. {\{}9.1.2, 9.8.1, Table 9.1, Figure 9.44{\}}},

abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis. NumPy is the primary array programming library for Python; here its fundamental concepts are reviewed and its evolution into a flexible interoperability layer between increasingly specialized computational libraries is discussed.},

abstract = {Large changes in the hydrology of the western United
States have been observed since the mid-twentieth
century. These include a reduction in the amount of
precipitation arriving as snow, a decline in
snowpack at low and midelevations, and a shift
toward earlier arrival of both snowmelt and the
centroid (center of mass) of streamflows. To project
future water supply reliability, it is crucial to
obtain a better understanding of the underlying
cause or causes for these changes. A regional
warming is often posited as the cause of these
changes without formal testing of different
competitive explanations for the warming. In this
study, a rigorous detection and attribution analysis
is performed to determine the causes of the late
winter/early spring changes in hydrologically
relevant temperature variables over mountain ranges
of the western United States. Natural internal
climate variability, as estimated from two long
control climate model simulations, is insufficient
to explain the rapid increase in daily minimum and
maximum temperatures, the sharp decline in frost
days, and the rise in degree-days above 0 degrees C
(a simple proxy for temperature-driven
snowmelt). These observed changes are also
inconsistent with the model-predicted responses to
variability in solar irradiance and volcanic
activity. The observations are consistent with
climate simulations that include the combined
effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and
aerosols. It is found that, for each temperature
variable considered, an anthropogenic signal is
identifiable in observational fields. The results
are robust to uncertainties in model-estimated
fingerprints and natural variability noise, to the
choice of statistical down-scaling method, and to
various processing options in the detection and
attribution method.},

abstract = {A detailed vertically integrated atmospheric heat
and energy budget is presented along with estimated
heat budgets at the surface and top-of-atmosphere
for the subtropics. It is shown that the total
energy transports are remarkably seamless in spite
of greatly varying mechanisms. From the Tropics to
about 318 latitude, the primary transport mechanisms
are the Hadley and Walker overturning
circulations. In the extratropics the energy
transports are carried out by baroclinic eddies
broadly organized into storm tracks and
quasi-stationary waves that covary in a symbiotic
way as the location and activity in storm tracks are
determined by, and in turn help maintain through
eddy transports, the quasi-stationary flow. In the
upward branch of the Hadley cell, the predominant
diabatic process is latent heating that results from
convergence of moisture by the circulation
itself. Hence large poleward transports of dry
static energy are compensated by equatorward
transports of latent energy, resulting in a modest
poleward transport of moist static energy. The
subsidence warming in the downward branch is
compensated by cooling in the subtropics that mainly
arises from energy transport to higher latitudes by
transient baroclinic eddies that are stronger in the
winter hemisphere. Effectively, the outgoing
longwave radiation to space is distributed over
middle and high latitudes and is not limited to the
clear dry regions in the subtropics. Further, some
of the radiative cooling in the subtropics is a
consequence of the circulation. Hence the cooling by
transient eddies in the subtropics is a fundamental
driver of the observed Hadley circulation and
realizes the seamless transport from Tropics to
extratropics, while tropical sea surface
temperatures over the oceans determine where the
upward branch is located. The relatively clear skies
in the subtropics further provide for ample
absorption of solar radiation at the surface where
it feeds strong evaporation, which exceeds
precipitation, and supplies the equatorward flow of
latent energy into the upward branch of the Hadley
circulation as well as the poleward transports into
midlatitude storm tracks. The evaporation is
sufficiently strong that it is also compensated by a
subsurface ocean heat transport that in turn is
driven by the Hadley circulation surface winds.},

However, causality of this covariability remains unclear. Here, we address this issue using atmospheric model experiments prescribed with observed sea surface temperature variations and either constant or time-varying sea ice variability. We show that the observed relationship between late-autumn Barents-Kara sea ice and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation can be reproduced by simulated atmospheric internal variability but is not simulated as a forced response to sea ice. Observations and models suggest reduced sea ice is linked to a weaker Aleutian Low. We show that simulated Aleutian Low variability is correlated with observed sea ice variability even in simulations with fixed sea ice, implying that this relationship is not incidental. Instead, we suggest that covariability between sea ice and the Aleutian Low originates from tropical sea surface temperature and rainfall variations and their teleconnections to the extratropics.},

abstract = {In some decades, such as 2000–2009, the observed globally averaged surface-temperature time series has shown a flat or slightly negative trend. A modelling study provides evidence that heat uptake by the deep ocean may cause these hiatus periods and may be linked to La Ni{\~{n}}a-like conditions. There have been decades, such as 2000–2009, when the observed globally averaged surface-temperature time series shows little increase or even a slightly negative trend1 (a hiatus period). However, the observed energy imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere for this recent decade indicates that a net energy flux into the climate system of about 1 W m−2 (refs 2, 3) should be producing warming somewhere in the system4,5. Here we analyse twenty-first-century climate-model simulations that maintain a consistent radiative imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere of about 1 W m−2 as observed for the past decade. Eight decades with a slightly negative global mean surface-temperature trend show that the ocean above 300 m takes up significantly less heat whereas the ocean below 300 m takes up significantly more, compared with non-hiatus decades. The model provides a plausible depiction of processes in the climate system causing the hiatus periods, and indicates that a hiatus period is a relatively common climate phenomenon and may be linked to La Ni{\~{n}}a-like conditions.},

abstract = {Given the rapidly changing Arctic climate, there is an urgent need for improved seasonal predictions of Arctic sea ice. Yet, Arctic sea ice prediction is inherently complex. Among other factors, wintertime atmospheric circulation has been shown to be predictive of summertime Arctic sea ice extent. Specifically, many studies have shown that the interannual variability of summertime Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) is anti-correlated with the leading mode of extratropical atmospheric variability, the Arctic Oscillation (AO), in the preceding winter. Given this relationship, the potential predictive role of stratospheric circulation extremes and stratosphere-troposphere coupling in linking the AO and Arctic SIE variability is examined. It is shown that extremes in the stratospheric circulation during the winter season, namely stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) and strong polar vortex (SPV) events, are associated with significant anomalies in sea ice concentration in the Barents Sea in spring and along the...},

Several challenges remain, particularly those stemming from structural limitations in process-based climate models and the temporal and geographic limitations of historical observations. However, the growing use of large climate-model ensembles that capture natural climate variability, fine-scale simulations that better represent underlying physical processes, and the lengthening observational record could obviate some of these concerns in the near future.

onset of midlatitude spring has not been widely
examined, despite their critical implications for
global-scale biospheric measures and climate
change. Further conventional assessment of these
phenomena across multiple locations is restricted by
satellite-derived data limitations, and the paucity
of surface measurement sites. In this paper, we
explore a new phenology-based strategy for
evaluating the spring surface energy-balance shift
that can address these concerns. Our technique can
reflect native-species responses and atmospheric
surface layer change at a variety of sites, using
synoptic-scale first leaf and first bloom phenology
models. We test the approach at three locations with
diverse climates, and within a group of stations in
the state of Oklahoma, which has moderate climate
variations across an east-to-west gradient. The
results show that the onset of spring in
midlatitudes is a modally abrupt (rather than
gradual) seasonal transition in terms of energy
balance (sensible and latent heat levels) and
carbon-flux change that can be linked directly to
vegetation phenology. The consistent temporal
pattern and magnitude of flux variations across
diverse sites suggest that this technique has
potential as a proxy for spring energy-balance

short gage records. In this study, we present a
network of 14 annual streamflow reconstructions,
300-600 years long, for gages in the Upper Colorado
and South Platte River basins in Colorado generated
from new and existing tree-ring chronologies. Gages
for the reconstruction were selected on the basis of
their importance to two of the largest Colorado
Front Range water providers, who provided the
natural flow data for the calibration with tree-ring
data. The reconstruction models explain 63-76{\%} of
the variance in the gage records and capture low
flows particularly well. Analyses of the
reconstructions indicate that the 20th century gage
record does not fully represent the range of
streamflow characteristics seen in the prior two to
five centuries. Multi-year drought events more
severe than the 1950s drought have occurred, notably
in the 19th century, and the distribution of extreme
low flow years is markedly uneven over the past
three centuries. When the 14 reconstructions are

abstract = {The transport of moisture into the Arctic is tightly connected to midlatitude dynamics. We show that the bulk of the transient poleward moisture transport across 60°N is driven by extreme transport (fluxes greater than the 90th percentile) events. We demonstrate that these events are closely related to the two types of Rossby wave breaking (RWB)-anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) and cyclonic wave breaking (CWB). Using a RWB tracking algorithm, we determine that RWB can account for approximately 68{\%} of the extreme poleward moisture transport by transients across 60°N in winter and 56{\%} in summer. Additional analysis suggests that the seasonality of such RWB-related moisture transport is determined approximately equally by (1) the magnitude of transport (which is largely a function of the background moisture gradient) and (2) the frequency of RWB occurrence. The seasonality of RWB occurrence is, in turn, tied to the seasonal variation of the latitude of the jet streams-AWB-related (CWB-related) transport occurs more frequently when the jet is shifted poleward (equatorward). The interannual variability of RWB-related transport across 60°N in winter is shown to be strongly influenced by climate variability captured by the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In the positive (negative) phase of ENSO, AWB transports less (more) moisture through the Bering Strait and CWB transports more (less) through western Canada. In the positive (negative) phase of the NAO, AWB transports more (less) moisture through the Norwegian Sea and CWB transports less (more) along the west coast of Greenland. These results highlight that low-frequency climate variability outside of the polar regions can influence the Arctic water vapor by modulating extreme synoptic transport events.},

Its emergence has been linked to a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which leads to a reduced ocean heat transport into the warming hole region. Here we show that, in addition to the reduced low-latitude heat import, increased ocean heat transport out of the region into higher latitudes and a shortwave cloud feedback dominate the formation and temporal evolution of the warming hole under greenhouse gas forcing. In climate model simulations of the historical period, the low-latitude Atlantic meridional overturning circulation decline does not emerge from natural variability, whereas the accelerating heat transport to higher latitudes is clearly attributable to anthropogenic forcing. Both the overturning and the gyre circulation contribute to the increased high-latitude ocean heat transport, and therefore are critical to understand the past and future evolutions of the warming hole.},

We show that locations with the largest amount of warming may not display a clear shift in temperature distributions if the local variability is also large. Based on observational data only we demonstrate that large parts of the Earth have experienced a significant local shift towards warmer temperatures in the summer season, particularly at lower latitudes.

abstract = {The Arctic climate system is rapidly transitioning into a new regime with a reduction in the extent of sea ice, enhanced mixing in the ocean and atmosphere, and thus enhanced coupling within the ocean-ice-atmosphere system; these physical changes are leading to ecosystem changes in the Arctic Ocean. In this review paper, we assess one of the critically important aspects of this new regime, the variability of Arctic freshwater, which plays a fundamental role in the Arctic climate system by impacting ocean stratification and sea ice formation or melt. Liquid and solid freshwater exports also affect the global climate system, notably by impacting the global ocean overturning circulation. We assess how freshwater budgets have changed relative to the 2000-2010 period. We include discussions of processes such as poleward atmospheric moisture transport, runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet and Arctic glaciers, the role of snow on sea ice, and vertical redistribution. Notably, sea ice cover has become more seasonal and more mobile; the mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet increased in the 2010s (particularly in the western, northern, and southern regions) and imported warm, salty Atlantic waters have shoaled. During 2000-2010, the Arctic Oscillation and moisture transport into the Arctic are in-phase and have a positive trend. This cyclonic atmospheric circulation pattern forces reduced freshwater content on the Atlantic-Eurasian side of the Arctic Ocean and freshwater gains in the Beaufort Gyre. We show that the trend in Arctic freshwater content in the 2010s has stabilized relative to the 2000s, potentially due to an increased compensation between a freshening of the Beaufort Gyre and a reduction in freshwater in the rest of the Arctic Ocean. However, large inter-model spread across the ocean reanalyses and uncertainty in the observations used in this study prevent a definitive conclusion about the degree of this compensation.},

abstract = {The ongoing loss of Arctic sea-ice cover has implications for the wider climate system. The detection and importance of the atmospheric impacts of sea-ice loss depends, in part, on the relative magnitudes of the sea-ice forced change compared to natural atmospheric internal variability (AIV). This study analyses large ensembles of two independent atmospheric general circulation models in order to separate the forced response to historical Arctic sea-ice loss (1979–2009) from AIV, and to quantify signal-to-noise ratios. We also present results from a simulation with the sea-ice forcing roughly doubled in magnitude. In proximity to regions of sea-ice loss, we identify statistically significant near-surface atmospheric warming and precipitation increases, in autumn and winter in both models. In winter, both models exhibit a significant lowering of sea level pressure and geopotential height over the Arctic. All of these responses are broadly similar, but strengthened and/or more geographically extensive, when the sea-ice forcing is doubled in magnitude. Signal-to-noise ratios differ considerably between variables and locations. The temperature and precipitation responses are significantly easier to detect (higher signal-to-noise ratio) than the sea level pressure or geopotential height responses. Equally, the local response (i.e., in the vicinity of sea-ice loss) is easier to detect than the mid-latitude or upper-level responses. Based on our estimates of signal-to-noise, we conjecture that the local near-surface temperature and precipitation responses to past Arctic sea-ice loss exceed AIV and are detectable in observed records, but that the potential atmospheric circulation, upper-level and remote responses may be partially or wholly masked by AIV.},

degreesC and is projected to continue to rise at a

show changes are shifting in the direction expected
on the basis of known physiological constraints of
species. Consequently, the balance of evidence from
these studies strongly suggests that a significant
impact of global warming is already discernible in
animal and plant populations. The synergism of rapid
temperature rise and other stresses, in particular
habitat destruction, could easily disrupt the

Data from multi-year sampling (i.e., 2014–2016) was renormalized to reflect 14C signatures of the 2015 calendar year. Spatial variability in $\Delta$14C ranges from a maximum of 27.1 ± 0.4‰ (city of Petr{\'{o}}polis, a higher-elevation municipality) to a minimum of −43.6 ± 1.4‰ (i.e., approximately 27.6 ± 1 ppm of Cff — Santo Cristo, a district within the Rio de Janeiro city). Overall, higher $\Delta$14C values correlate well with green habitats and high elevation areas, while lower values are associated with Cff emissions in densely populated areas with higher industrial and traffic footprints. Cff emissions are higher where local air circulation is poor, such as the area surrounding Guanabara Bay. Other areas with significantly higher Cff emissions were the Para{\'{i}}ba Valley and Mountain regions. These results may be explained by atmospheric transport of CO2 from neighboring states, such as S{\~{a}}o Paulo and Minas Gerais, and by the predominant west winds and the limited regional air flow created by large topographic features. Lower Cff emissions were observed in the Northwest and Lakes regions, which are dominated by agriculture and tourism activities. Our results highlight the potential of directly estimating Cff for studying urban landscapes in the southern region of Brazil through 14C time-integrated distribution mapping of ip{\^{e}} leaves. The method could also be used to augment greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory studies trends in partitioning Cff from CO2 of bio-template sustainable sources.},

abstract = {[1] The origins of the delayed increases in global
surface temperature accompanying El Nino events and
the implications for the role of diabatic processes
in El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are
explored. The evolution of global mean surface
temperatures, zonal means and fields of sea surface
temperatures, land surface temperatures,
precipitation, outgoing longwave radiation,
vertically integrated diabatic heating and
divergence of atmospheric energy transports, and
ocean heat content in the Pacific is documented
using correlation and regression analysis. For
1950-1998, ENSO linearly accounts for 0.06degreesC
of global surface temperature increase. Warming
events peak 3 months after SSTs in the Nino 3.4
region, somewhat less than is found in previous
studies. Warming at the surface progressively
extends to about +/-30 latitude with lags of several
months. While the development of ocean heat content
anomalies resembles that of the delayed oscillator
paradigm, the damping of anomalies through heat
fluxes into the atmosphere introduces a substantial
diabatic component to the discharge and recharge of
the ocean heat content. However, most of the delayed
warming outside of the tropical Pacific comes from
persistent changes in atmospheric circulation forced
from the tropical Pacific. A major part of the ocean
heat loss to the atmosphere is through evaporation
and thus is realized in the atmosphere as latent
heating in precipitation, which drives
teleconnections. Reduced precipitation and increased
solar radiation in Australia, Southeast Asia, parts
of Africa, and northern South America contribute to
surface warming that peaks several months after the
El Nino event. Teleconnections contribute to the
extensive warming over Alaska and western Canada
through a deeper Aleutian low and stronger southerly
flow into these regions 0-12 months later. The
1976/1977 climate shift and the effects of two major
volcanic eruptions in the past 2 decades are
reflected in different evolution of ENSO events. At
the surface, for 1979-1998 the warming in the
central equatorial Pacific develops from the west
and progresses eastward, while for 1950-1978 the
anomalous warming begins along the coast of South
America and spreads westward. The eastern Pacific
south of the equator warms 4-8 months later for
1979-1998 but cools from 1950 to 1978.},

Because the GISS analysis combines available sea surface temperature records with meteorological station measurements, we test alternative choices for the ocean data, showing that global temperature change is sensitive to estimated temperature change in polar regions where observations are limited. We use simple 12 month (and n × 12) running means to improve the information content in our temperature graphs. Contrary to a popular misconception, the rate of warming has not declined. Global temperature is rising as fast in the past decade as in the prior 2 decades, despite year-to-year fluctuations associated with the El Nio-La Nia cycle of tropical ocean temperature.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}![CDATA[Abstract. In recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70∘ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2.5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65∘ N are larger than emissions from the anthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60∘ N, with 56 {\%} of black carbon emissions above 65∘ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.]]{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

MetPy also prides itself on being well-documented and well-tested, so that on-going maintenance is easily manageable.

abstract = {The dramatic warming of the Arctic over the last three decades has reduced both the thickness and extent of sea ice, opening opportunities for business in diverse sectors and increasing human exposure to meteorological hazards in the Arctic. It has been suggested that these changes in environmental conditions have led to an increase in extreme cyclones in the region, therefore increasing this hazard. In this study, we investigate the response of Arctic synoptic scale cyclones to climate change in a large initial value ensemble of future climate projections with the CESM1-CAM5 climate model (CESM-LE). We find that the response of Arctic cyclones in these simulations varies with season, with significant reductions in cyclone dynamic intensity across the Arctic basin in winter, but with contrasting increases in summer intensity within the region known as the Arctic Ocean cyclone maximum. There is also a significant reduction in winter cyclogenesis events within the Greenland–Iceland–Norwegian sea region. We conclude that these differences in the response of cyclone intensity and cyclogenesis, with season, appear to be closely linked to changes in surface temperature gradients in the high latitudes, with Arctic poleward temperature gradients increasing in summer, but decreasing in winter.},

abstract = {Climate change poses threats to human health, safety, and survival via weather extremes and climatic impacts on food yields, fresh water, infectious diseases, conflict, and displacement. Paradoxically, these risks to health are neither widely nor fully recognized. Historical experiences of diverse societies experiencing climatic changes, spanning multicentury to single-year duration, provide insights into population health vulnerability--even though most climatic changes were considerably less than those anticipated this century and beyond. Historical experience indicates the following. (i) Long-term climate changes have often destabilized civilizations, typically via food shortages, consequent hunger, disease, and unrest. (ii) Medium-term climatic adversity has frequently caused similar health, social, and sometimes political consequences. (iii) Infectious disease epidemics have often occurred in association with briefer episodes of temperature shifts, food shortages, impoverishment, and social disruption. (iv) Societies have often learnt to cope (despite hardship for some groups) with recurring shorter-term (decadal to multiyear) regional climatic cycles (e.g., El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation)--except when extreme phases occur. (v) The drought-famine-starvation nexus has been the main, recurring, serious threat to health. Warming this century is not only likely to greatly exceed the Holocene's natural multidecadal temperature fluctuations but to occur faster. Along with greater climatic variability, models project an increased geographic range and severity of droughts. Modern societies, although larger, better resourced, and more interconnected than past societies, are less flexible, more infrastructure-dependent, densely populated, and hence are vulnerable. Adverse historical climate-related health experiences underscore the case for abating human-induced climate change.},

The dominant mode of winter (January–March) sea ice variability exhibits out-of-phase fluctuations between the western and eastern North Atlantic, together with a weaker dipole in the North Pacific. The time series of this mode has a high winter-to-winter autocorrelation (0.69) and is dominated by decadal-scale variations and a longer-term trend of diminishing ice cover east of Greenland and increasing ice cover west of Greenland. Associated with the dominant pattern of winter sea ice variability are large-scale changes in SAT and SLP that closely resemble the North Atlantic oscillation.

abstract = {In North America and Asia, extreme cold weather characterized the winter of 2017–18. At the same time, the Pacific, the Bering Sea, and the Atlantic Arctic regions experienced anomalously low sea ice extent in the early winter. The jet stream dividing cold Arctic air from warm air deviated from normal zonal patterns northward into the ice-free areas north of the Bering Strait. Large southward jet stream pathways formed over Asia and America, allowing cold air to spread into Asia and the southern areas of North America. We hypothesise that the late autumn Bering Strait sea-ice anomaly and Pacific atmospheric rivers were partially responsible for the cold winter. We used data analyses and numerical experiments to test this hypothesis. We propose a positive feedback mechanism between the sea ice anomaly and atmospheric river activity, with anomalous south winds toward the sea ice anomaly potentially leading to more warm water injected by the wind-driven current through the Bering Strait. Our findings suggest that Poleward propagation of the atmospheric rivers made upper air warm, leading to their upgliding, which further heated the overlying air, causing poleward jet meanders. As a part of this response the jet stream meandered southward over Asia and North America, resulting in cold intrusions. We speculate that the positive feedback mechanism observed during the 2017–18 winter could recur in future years when the sea-ice reduction in the Pacific Arctic interacts with enhanced atmospheric river activity.},

abstract = {The Italy coral record from off SW Madagascar
provide a 336-year coral oxygen isotope record that
is used to investigate the natural variability of
the western Indian Ocean subtropical SST dipole and
ENSO. The coral oxygen isotope record primarily
reflects past sea-surface temperature (SST)
variability on seasonal to multidecadal scales. To
validate the SST reconstructions derived from oxygen
isotopes, Sr/Ca ratios were obtained for selected
time windows (1973-1995, 18631910, 1784-1809,
1688-1710). The period 1675-1760 was found to be the
coolest period of the entire record with anomalies
of 0.3-0.5 degreesC that includes the Late Maunder
Minimum (1675-1710). The warmest periods, as
indicated by our data, occur between 1880 and 1900
and the upper part of the Ifaty record (1973-1995).
We generated a time series of coral 6180 for
different seasons of the year to investigate austral
winter and summer SST variability that influences
rainfall intensity over southern Africa. Winter
coral 6180 is coherent with winter SST on decadal
and mulidecadal time scales between 1854 and
1995. We suggest that the Ifaty winter time series
provides a record of winter SST variability over the
Mozambique Channel/Agulhas Current region over 336
years. Strong Indian Ocean subtropical dipole
events, occurring during austral summer, are
displayed in the Italy record. The austral summer
coral 6180 is coherent and in phase with ENSO
indices on interannual time scales (2-4 years)
between 1880-1920, 1930-1940 and after 1970. Our
data indicate that the impact of ENSO on SW Indian
Ocean SST and atmospheric circulation was also
strong between 1680-1720 and 1760-1790, in agreement
with other studies. We show evidence that those
variations are caused by changes in the regional
hydrologic balance. The results demonstrate that the
impact of ENSO cycles in the region of the SW Indian
Ocean has changed significantly since 1970 and
relate to a warming of southwestern Indian Ocean
surface waters altering the spatial signature of
ENSO. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we show that apparently contradictory conclusions stem from different definitions of 'hiatus' and from different datasets.

A household's evacuation decision is framed as an optimal stopping problem in which every potential evacuation time period prior to the actual hurricane landfall, the household's optimal choice is to either evacuate or to wait one more time period for a revised hurricane forecast. We build a realistic multiperiod model of evacuation that incorporates actual forecast and evacuation cost data for our designated Gulf of Mexico region. Results from our multiperiod model are calibrated with existing evacuation timing data from a number of hurricanes. Given the calibrated dynamic framework, a number of policy questions that plausibly affect the timing of household evacuations are analyzed, and a deeper understanding of existing empirical outcomes in regard to the timing of the evacuation decision is achieved. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

We find that large spread in the projected timing of the September ice-free Arctic in 30 CMIP5 models is associated at least as much with different atmospheric model components as with initial conditions. Here we reduce the spread in the timing of an ice-free state using two different approaches for the 30 CMIP5 models: (i) model selection based on the ability to reproduce the observed sea ice climatology and variability since 1979 and (ii) constrained estimation based on the strong and persistent relationship between present and future sea ice conditions. Results from the two approaches show good agreement. Under a high-emission scenario both approaches project that September ice extent will drop to ∼1.7 million km(2) in the mid 2040s and reach the ice-free state (defined as 1 million km(2)) in 2054-2058. Under a medium-mitigation scenario, both approaches project a decrease to ∼1.7 million km(2) in the early 2060s, followed by a leveling off in the ice extent.},

major Amazon tributaries fell drastically to
unprecedented low values, and isolated the
floodplain population whose transportation depends
upon on local streams which completely dried up. The
drought of 2010 in Amazonia started in early austral
summer during El Nino and then was intensified as a
consequence of the warming of the tropical North
Atlantic. An observed tendency for an increase in
dry and very dry events, particularly in southern
Amazonia during the dry season, is concomitant with
an increase in the length of the dry season. Our
results suggest that it is by means of a longer dry
season that warming in the tropical North Atlantic
affects the hydrology of the Amazon Rivers at the
end of the recession period (austral spring). This
process is, sometimes, further aggravated by
deficient rainfall in the previous wet

This variation is dominated by the seasonal changes over the Antarctic Ocean where the second (semiannual) harmonic of the mid-tropospheric meridional temperature gradient has a magnitude exceeding that of the first (annual) harmonic. The existence of the marked semiannual component in this region is shown to be a consequence of the difference between the heating and cooling rates in different latitudes where the mid-tropospheric annual temperature ranges are similar. In latitude 50S cooling in autumn is rapid compared with the warming in spring, the reverse being true at latitude 65S. This behavior is related to the heat budget of the oceanic upper layers.

We then use a neural-network explainability method called layerwise relevance propagation to infer which oceanic patterns lead to accurate predictions made by the neural networks. In particular, regions within the North Atlantic Ocean and North Pacific Ocean lend the most predictability for surface temperature across continental North America. We apply the proposed methodology to decadal variability, although the concept is generalizable to other timescales of predictability. Furthermore, while our approach focuses on predictable patterns of internal variability within climate models, it should be generalizable to observational data as well.

abstract = {We present our estimates of the thickness and volume of the Arctic Ocean ice cover from CryoSat-2 data acquired between October 2010 and May 2014. Average ice thickness and draft differences are within 0.16 m of measurements from other sources (moorings, submarine, electromagnetic sensors, IceBridge). The choice of parameters that affect the conversion of ice freeboard to thickness is discussed. Estimates between 2011 and 2013 suggest moderate decreases in volume followed by a notable increase of more than 2500 km(3) (or 0.34 m of thickness over the basin) in 2014, which could be attributed to not only a cooler summer in 2013 but also to large-scale ice convergence just west of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago due to wind-driven onshore drift. Variability of volume and thickness in the multiyear ice zone underscores the importance of dynamics in maintaining the thickness of the Arctic ice cover. Volume estimates are compared with those from ICESat as well as the trends in ice thickness derived from submarine ice draft between 1980 and 2004. The combined ICESat and CryoSat-2 record yields reduced trends in volume loss compared with the 5 year ICESat record, which was weighted by the record-setting ice extent after the summer of 2007.},

abstract = {In many atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations, the sea surface temperature (SST) and sea-ice concentration (i.e., percentage of area covered by sea ice) are both prescribed, based on observations. In particular this experimental design is fundamental to the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project simulations. For AMIP, observed monthly mean SSTs and sea-ice concentration have been compiled for the period January 1979 through February 1996 and also for the month preceding and for several months following the designated AMIP II period. These observed monthly means do not constitute the official AMIP II "boundary conditions," but the boundary conditions are based on them, as explained in this brief report. In AMIP II the SST and sea-ice concentration boundary conditions should be specified such that the monthly means computed from the model output precisely agree with the observed monthly means. There are several ways to assure compliance with this AMIP II requirement, but for most models which rely on linear interpolation between monthly values, appropriate AMIP II boundary condition data sets can be obtained from the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI).},

Dynamical processes described by these distributions cannot be uniquely identified as belonging to one or the other class either by diverging variance due to power-law tails in the pdf or by the possible existence of skew. However, there are distinguishing features that may be found in sufficiently well sampled time series. We examine these features and discuss how they may guide the development of proper approximations to equations of motion underlying dynamical systems. An additional result of this research was the identification of a variable describing the relative importance of the multiplicative and independent additive noise forcing in our linear Markov process. The distribution of this variable is generally skewed, depending on the level of correlation between the additive and multiplicative noise.},

abstract = {[1] Interannual variability of the atmospheric heat
budget is explored via a new data set of the
computed vertically integrated energy transports to
examine relationships with other fields. A case
study reveals very large monthly divergences of
these transports regionally with El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and the associated changes with
the Pacific-North American teleconnection pattern,
and with the North Atlantic Oscillation. In the
tropical Pacific during large El Nino events the
anomalous divergence of the atmospheric energy
transports exceeds 50 W m(-2) over broad regions for
several months. Examination of the corresponding
top-of-the-atmosphere net radiative fluxes shows
that it is primarily the surface fluxes from the
ocean to the atmosphere that feed the divergent
atmospheric transports. A systematic investigation
of the covariability of sea surface temperatures
(SSTs) and the divergence of atmospheric energy
transport, using singular value decomposition
analysis of the temporal covariance, reveals ENSO as
dominant in the first two modes, explaining 62{\%} and
12{\%} of the covariance in the Pacific domain and
explaining 39.5{\%} and 15.4{\%} globally for the first
and second modes, respectively. The first mode is
well represented by the time series for the SST
index for Nino 3.4 region (170degreesW-120degreesW,
5degreesN-5degreesS). Regression analysis allows a
more complete view of how the SSTs, outgoing
longwave radiation, precipitation, diabatic heating,
and atmospheric circulation respond with ENSO. The
second mode indicates aspects of the systematic
evolution of ENSO with time, with strong lead and
lag correlations. It primarily reflects differences
in the evolution of ENSO across the tropical Pacific
from about the dateline to coastal South
America. High SSTs associated with warm ENSO events
are damped through surface heat fluxes into the
atmosphere, which transports the energy into higher
latitudes and throughout the tropics, contributing
to loss of heat by the ocean, while the cold ENSO
events correspond to a recharge phase as heat enters
the ocean. Diabatic processes are clearly important
within ENSO evolution.},

Comparison with model output from five other international climate modelling centres and observational data are also included in the assessment process. The assessment takes into account modelled climatologies and interannual variability of the sea ice extent, concentration, thickness and transport. The ACCESS models give good simulations of the global sea-ice, within the scatter of models studied, and is one of the top performing models for sea-ice metrics. CSIRO-Mk3.6 has too extensive sea-ice and the sea-ice model would likely have performed significantly better after adjustment of the model parameters. As a consequence, ACCESS and CSIRO-Mk3.6 show opposite hemispheric climate sensitivities in terms of sea ice. The ACCESS models generally capture the observed decline of the Arctic sea ice over the period of 1981-2011, but not the small increase in the Antarctic sea ice, although the simulated changes over this period are generally smaller in the Antarctic than in the Arctic. In the Arctic, the sea-ice reductions in the ACCESS models occur in the Laptev and Kara Seas rather than in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas as observed.

A wave geometry diagnostic for wave propagation characteristics that separates the index of refraction into vertical and meridional components is used to diagnose the occurrence of reflecting surfaces.

The reliability of models' simulations is often gauged by their ability to reproduce the historical climate across many time scales. This study compares the global mean surface air temperature from 29 CMIP6 models with observations from three datasets. We examine (1) warming and cooling rates in five subperiods from 1880 to 2014, (2) autocorrelation and long-term persistence, (3) models' performance based on probabilistic and entropy metrics, and (4) the distributional shape of temperature. All models simulate the observed long-term warming trend from 1880 to 2014. The late twentieth century warming (1975–2014) and the hiatus (1942–1975) are replicated by most models. The post-1998 warming is overestimated in 90{\%} of the simulations. Only six out of 29 models reproduce the observed long-term persistence. All models show differences in distributional shape when compared with observations. Varying performance across metrics reveals the challenge to determine the “best” model. Thus, we argue that models should be selected, based on case-specific metrics, depending on the intended use. Metrics proposed here facilitate a comprehensive assessment for various applications.},

abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 and anthropogenic aerosols (AA) have increased simultaneously. Because of their opposite radiative effects, these increases may offset each other, which may lead to some nonlinear effects. Here the seasonal and regional characteristics of this nonlinear effect from the CO2 and AA forcings are investigated using the fully coupled Community Earth System Model. Results show that nonlinear effects are small in the global mean of the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative fluxes, surface air temperature, and precipitation. However, significant nonlinear effects exist over the Arctic and other extratropical regions during certain seasons. When both forcings are included, Arctic sea ice in September-November decreases less than the linear combination of the responses to the individual forcings due to a higher sea ice sensitivity to the CO2induced warming than the sensitivity to the AA-induced cooling. This leads to less Arctic warming in the combined-forcing experiment due to reduced energy release from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere. Some nonlinear effects on precipitation in June-August are found over East Asia, with the northward-shifted East Asian summer rain belt to oppose the CO2 effect. In December-February, the aerosol loading over Europe in the combined-forcing experiment is higher than that due to the AA forcing, resulting from CO2-induced circulation changes. The changed aerosol loading results in regional thermal responses due to aerosol direct and indirect effects, weakening the combined changes of temperature and circulation. This study highlights the need to consider nonlinear effects from historical CO2 and AA forcings in seasonal and regional climate attribution analyses.},

A question of interest across many disciplines concerns the extent to which such extreme events can be attributed to anthropogenic influences. First, a detection and attribution analysis is performed for trends in SIE anomalies over the observed period. The main objective of this study is an event attribution analysis for extreme minimum events in Arctic SIE. Although focus is placed on the 2012 event, the results are generalized to extreme events of other magnitudes, including both past and potential future extremes. Several ensembles of model responses are used, including two single-model large ensembles. Using several different metrics to define the events in question, it is shown that an extreme SIE minimum of the magnitude seen in 2012 is consistent with a scenario including anthropogenic influence and is extremely unlikely in a scenario excluding anthropogenic influence. Hence, the 2012 Arctic sea ice minimum provides a counterexample to the often-quoted idea that individual extreme events cannot be attributed to human influence.},

abstract = {Prior to the 20th century Northern Hemisphere
average surface air temperatures have varied in the
order of 0.5 degrees C back to AD 1000. Various
climate reconstructions indicate that slow cooling
took place until the beginning of the 20th
century. Subsequently, global-average surface air
temperature increased by about 0.6 degrees C with
the 1990s being the warmest decade on record. The
pattern of warming has been greatest over
mid-latitude northern continents in the latter part
of the century. At the same time the frequency of
air frosts has decreased over many land areas, and
there has been a drying in the tropics and
sub-tropics. The late 20th century changes have been
attributed to global warming because of increases in
atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations due to
human activities. Underneath these trends is that of
decadal scale variability in the Pacific basin at
least induced by the Interdecadal Pacific
Oscillation (IPO), which causes decadal changes in
climate averages. On interannnual timescales El Ni
(n) over tildeo/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) causes
much variability throughout many tropical and
subtropical regions and some mid-latitude areas. The
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) provides climate
perturbations over Europe and northern
Africa. During the course of the 21st century
global-average surface temperatures are very likely
to increase by 2 to 4.5 degrees C as greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere increase. At the
same time there will be changes in precipitation,
and climate extremes such as hot days, heavy
rainfall and drought are expected to increase in
many areas. The combination of global warming,
superimposed on decadal climate variability (IPO)
and interannual fluctuations (ENSO, NAO) are
expected lead to a century of increasing climate
variability and change that will be unprecedented in
the history of human settlement. Although the
changes of the past and present have stressed food

changes will be extremely challenging to agriculture

abstract = {The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is the leading mode of variation in the northern hemisphere winter circulation. Despite its importance for winter temperatures, seasonal forecast models typically suggest that its predictability is low. Nonetheless, we show that an operational forecast model has high skill in predicting the AO, with a correlation of 0.61 for the period of 1981-2010. Experimentation covering a recent 8year high-skill period demonstrates the predictability of the model AO to be dominated by atmospheric initial conditions, although surface forcing does have increasing influence later in the winter. Results suggest that the stratosphere is an important carrier of model predictability during the early winter. These results challenge the conventional paradigm of surface forcing being the dominant source of predictability on seasonal time scales but are compatible with the results showing stratospheric influence on winter circulation. They also suggest that model representation of stratospheric to tropospheric coupling needs urgent improvement.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A new long-term data record of Fram Strait sea ice area export from 1935 to 2014 is developed using a combination of satellite radar images and station observations of surface pressure across Fram Strait. This data record shows that the long-term annual mean export is about 880?000?km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, representing 10?{\%} of the sea-ice-covered area inside the basin. The time series has large interannual and multi-decadal variability but no long-term trend. However, during the last decades, the amount of ice exported has increased, with several years having annual ice exports that exceeded 1?million?km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. This increase is a result of faster southward ice drift speeds due to stronger southward geostrophic winds, largely explained by increasing surface pressure over Greenland. Evaluating the trend onwards from 1979 reveals an increase in annual ice export of about +6?{\%} per decade, with spring and summer showing larger changes in ice export (+11?{\%} per decade) compared to autumn and winter (+2.6?{\%} per decade). Increased ice export during winter will generally result in new ice growth and contributes to thinning inside the Arctic Basin. Increased ice export during summer or spring will, in contrast, contribute directly to open water further north and a reduced summer sea ice extent through the ice?albedo feedback. Relatively low spring and summer export from 1950 to 1970 is thus consistent with a higher mid-September sea ice extent for these years. Our results are not sensitive to long-term change in Fram Strait sea ice concentration. We find a general moderate influence between export anomalies and the following September sea ice extent, explaining 18?{\%} of the variance between 1935 and 2014, but with higher values since 2004.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Doll2017,
abstract = {Farmers stand to be greatly affected by changes in the climate, necessitating adaptive responses, yet little is documented on how U.S. Midwestern farmers understand and perceive climate change adaptation. Eight focus groups with 53 Michigan farmers were conducted in 2011-12 to better understand the following: 1) what do farmers think about the relationship between climate change and agriculture, 2) what differentiates normal weather-related management from climate change adaptation actions, and 3) how do farmers understand the term "climate change adaptation." Farmers expressed skepticism at global climate change yet conveyed specific details about the local changes in climate they are experiencing on their farms. They were not able to clearly define the term "climate change adaptation" but did note specific adaptive actions they have already implemented. The farmers explained that nonclimate factors were of more concern to them when making management decisions, and they showed reactive (not proactive) actions toward adaptation. Farmers noted that any action they take has to address their specific situation, suggesting that generalized adaptation actions and language might not resonate with them. Building on quantitative surveys conducted by others, the findings in this paper contribute to ongoing efforts to more effectively assess farmers' perceptions related to climate change adaptation and to use that understanding to promote education, outreach, research, and public policies to more proactively address the consequences posed by climate change.},
