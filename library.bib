Over this region, approximately 1°C warming in March temperatures has occurred since 1901. This long-term regional warming is an order of magnitude smaller than temperature anomalies observed during the event, indicating that most of the extreme warmth must be explained by other factors. Several lines of evidence strongly implicate natural variations as the primary cause for the extreme event. The 2012 temperature anomalies had a close analog in an exceptionally warm U.S. March occurring over 100 years earlier, providing observational evidence that an extreme event similar to March 2012 could be produced through natural variability alone. Coupled model forecasts and simulations forced by observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) show that forcing from anomalous SSTs increased the probability of e...},

   abstract = {This study examines the predictability of seasonal
mean Great Plains precipitation using an ensemble of
century-long atmospheric general circulation model
(AGCM) simulations forced with observed sea surface
temperatures (SSTs). The results show that the
predictability (intraensemble spread) of the
precipitation response to SST forcing varies on
interannual and longer time scales. In particular,
this study finds that pluvial conditions are more
predictable (have less intraensemble spread) than
drought conditions. This rather unexpected result is
examined in the context of the physical mechanisms
that impact precipitation in the Great Plains. These
mechanisms include El Nino-Southern Oscillation's
impact on the planetary waves and hence the Pacific
storm track (primarily during the cold season), the
role of Atlantic SSTs in forcing changes in the
Bermuda high and low-level moisture flux into the
continent (primarily during the warm season), and
soil moisture feedbacks (primarily during the warm
season). It is found that the changes in
predictability are primarily driven by changes in
the strength of the land-atmosphere coupling, such
that under dry conditions a given change in soil
moisture produces a larger change in evaporation and
hence precipitation than the same change in soil
moisture would produce under wet soil
conditions. The above changes in predictability are
associated with a negatively skewed distribution in
the seasonal mean precipitation during the warm
season-a result that is not inconsistent with the
observations.},

In view of these observations, a representation of moist convective transports for use in large-scale models is constructed, in which the fundamental entities are these subcloud-scale drafts rather than the clouds themselves. The transport by these small-scale drafts is idealized as follows. Air from the subcloud layer is lifted to each level i between cloud base and the level of neutral buoyancy for undilute air. A fraction (ϵi) of the condensed water is then converted to precipitation, which falls and partially or completely evaporates in an unsaturated downdraft. The remaining cloudy air is then assumed to form a uniform spectrum of mixtures with environmental air at level i; these mixtures ascend or descend according to their buoyancy.

   abstract = {Convective quasi-equilibrium (QE) has for several decades stood as a key postulate for parametrization of the impacts of moist convection at small scales upon the large-scale flow. Departures from QE have motivated stochastic convective parametrization, which in its early stages may be viewed as a sensitivity study. Introducing plausible stochastic terms to modify the existing convective parametrizations can have substantial impact, but, as for so many aspects of convective parametrization, the results are sensitive to details of the assumed processes. We present observational results aimed at helping to constrain convection schemes, with implications for each of conventional, stochastic or 'superparametrization' schemes. The original vision of QE due to Arakawa fares well as a leading approximation, but with a number of updates. Some, like the imperfect connection between the boundary layer and the free troposphere, and the importance of free-tropospheric moisture to buoyancy, are quantitatively important but lie within the framework of ensemble-average convection slaved to the large scale. Observations of critical phenomena associated with a continuous phase transition for precipitation as a function of water vapour and temperature suggest a more substantial revision. While the system's attraction to the critical point is predicted by QE, several fundamental properties of the transition, including high precipitation variance in the critical region, need to be added to the theory. Long-range correlations imply that this variance does not reduce quickly under spatial averaging; scaling associated with this spatial averaging has potential implications for superparametrization. Long tails of the distribution of water vapour create relatively frequent excursions above criticality with associated strong precipitation events.},

Simple theories suggest that global warming will reduce the strength of the mean tropical atmospheric circulation. An important aspect of this tropical circulation is a large-scale zonal (east-west) overturning of air across the equatorial Pacific Ocean--driven by convection to the west and subsidence to the east--known as the Walker circulation. Here we explore changes in tropical Pacific circulation since the mid-nineteenth century using observations and a suite of global climate model experiments. Observed Indo-Pacific sea level pressure reveals a weakening of the Walker circulation. The size of this trend is consistent with theoretical predictions, is accurately reproduced by climate model simulations and, within the climate models, is largely due to anthropogenic forcing. The climate model indicates that the weakened surface winds have altered the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical Pacific Ocean. These results support model projections of further weakening of tropical atmospheric circulation during the twenty-first century.},

Here we introduce a unique avenue toward El Ni\{ñ\}o prediction based on network methods, inspecting emerging teleconnections.

On this basis, we can develop an efficient 12-mo forecasting scheme, i.e., achieve some doubling of the early-warning period.

with numerous tree ring climate records, which are
frequently limited in preserving multi-centennial

   abstract = {It has recently been proposed, within the framework
of the linear shallow-water equations, that tropical
Pacific decadal variability (PDV) can be accounted
for by basin modes with eigenperiods of 10 to 20 yr,
amplifying a midlatitude wind forcing with an
essentially white spectrum. Here the authors use a
different formalism of linear equatorial wave
theory. The Green's function is computed for the
wind-forced response of a linear equatorial
shallow-water ocean and uses the earlier results of
Cane and Moore to obtain a compact, closed form
expression for the motion of the equatorial
thermocline, which applies to all frequencies lower
than seasonal. This expression is new and allows a
systematic comparison of the effect of low- and
high-latitude winds on the equatorial
thermocline. At very low frequencies ( decadal time
scales), the planetary geostrophic solution used by
Cessi and Louazel is recovered, as well as the
equatorial wave solution of Liu, and a formal
explanation for this convergence is
given. Nonetheless, this more general solution leads
one to a different interpretation of the results. In
contrast to the aforementioned studies, the authors
find that the equatorial thermocline is inherently
more sensitive to local than to remote wind forcing
and that planetary Rossby modes only weakly alter
the spectral characteristics of the
response. Tropical winds are able to generate a
strong equatorial response with periods of 10 to 20
yr, while midlatitude winds can only do so for
periods longer than about 50 yr. The results suggest
that ocean basin modes are an unlikely explanation
of decadal fluctuations in tropical Pacific sea

one of the few regions in North America where
precipitation exhibited a high proportion of
variance at decadal time scales (10 to 20 years)

ring-width records to estimate the behavior of the
observed decadal pattern in regional winter
precipitation during the last three and a half
centuries. The pattern was most vigorous during the
mid and late 20th century. Between A. D. 1650 and
1930, proxy estimates show a limited number of
events separated by longer intervals of relatively
low variance. The multicentennial perspective
offered by tree rings indicates the energetic
decadal pattern in winter precipitation is a
relatively recent feature. Until a physical
mechanism can be identified that explains the
presence of this decadal rhythm, as well as its
inconsistency during the period of record, we cannot
rule out the possibility that this behavior may
cease as abruptly as it began.},

System (RAMS) dynamically downscaling the NCEP-NCAR
Reanalysis I for the period 19502002 (described in
Part I of the study) are evaluated with respect to
the three dominant modes of global SST. Two of these
modes are associated with the statistically
significant, naturally occurring interannual and
interdecadal variability in the Pacific. The
remaining mode corresponds to the recent warming of
tropical sea surface temperatures. Time-evolving
teleconnections associated with Pacific SSTs delay
or accelerate the evolution of the North American
monsoon. At the period of maximum teleconnectivity
in late June and early July, there is an opposite
relationship between precipitation in the core
monsoon region and the central United States. Use of
a regional climate model (RCM) is essential to
capture this variability because of its
representation of the diurnal cycle of convective
rainfall. The RCM also captures the observed
long-term changes in Mexican summer rainfall and
suggests that these changes are due in part to the
recent increase in eastern Pacific SST off the
Mexican coast. To establish the physical linkage to
remote SST forcing, additional RAMS seasonal weather
prediction mode simulations were performed and these
results are briefly discussed. In order for RCMs to
be successful in a seasonal weather prediction mode
for the summer season, it is required that the GCM
provide a reasonable representation of the
teleconnections and have a climatology that is
comparable to a global atmospheric reanalysis.},

managers grapple with shortages imposed by
increasing demand and limited supply, and possibly
exacerbated by climate change. Two applications of
dendrochronology to the study of flow variability
are illustrated for an existing 1244-yr
reconstruction of annual flows of the Colorado River
at Lees Ferry, Arizona, USA: (1) identification and
climatological interpretation of rare flow events,
and (2) assessment of vulnerability of water-supply
systems to climatic variability. Analysis centers on
a sustained drought of the mid-1100s characterized
by persistent low flows on both the Colorado and
Sacramento Rivers. Analysis of geopotential height
anomalies during modern joint-droughts suggests more
than one mode of circulation might accompany
joint-drought in the two basins. Monte Carlo
simulation is used to demonstrate that a drought as
severe as that in the 1100s on the Colorado River
might be expected about once in every 4-6 centuries
by chance alone given the time-series properties of
the modern gaged flows. Application of a
river-management model suggests a mid-1100s-style
drought, were it to occur today, would drop
reservoir levels in Lake Mead to dead-pool within a
few decades. Uncertainty presents challenges to
accurately quantifying severe sustained droughts
from streamflow reconstructions, especially early in
the tree-ring record. Corroboration by multiple
proxy records is essential. Future improvements are
likely to require a combination of methodological
advancements and expanded basic data. (C) 2010

calcite frequently contains a climate signal, but
one that is difficult to interpret in terms of
either rainfall or temperature. Over
glacial-interglacial time periods and decadal
sampling resolution, stalagmite delta O-18 clearly
contains a 'first order' climate signal where the
magnitude of changes in temperature and
ocean/atmospheric circulation dominate the delta
O-18 signature. However, at annual-biennial
resolution sampling, and within interglacial
periods, the magnitude of climate changes is
smaller, and variability in delta O-18 introduced by
soil, karst groundwater and cave processes can
introduce considerable uncertainty into the climatic
interpretation of stalagmite delta O-18
records. Here, two approaches that can quantify the
climate signal contained with stalagmite delta O-18
are discussed. Firstly, linear regression based
approaches are reviewed, which correlate stalagmite
delta O-18 with instrumental climate parameters such
as temperature and rainfall. The advantages and
disadvantages of complex linear regression
approaches that attempt to account for groundwater
mixing within the karst aquifer are
discussed. Secondly, a forward modelling approach is
introduced, where stalagmite delta O-18 is modelled
from rainfall delta O-18, surface climate parameters
and a simple karst hydrology model. Using a case
study from Gibraltar, this latter approach
demonstrates that between stalagmite variability in
delta O-18 of the order of 1 parts per thousand can
be explained solely by differences in karst
hydrology. Forward modelling suggests that a similar
variability in delta O-18 might be observed between
stalagmites within a cave, or between caves within a
homogenous climate region, and highlights the
difficulty in attempting to use delta O-18 as a
paleo-thermometer. (C) 2009 Elsevier BM. All rights

   abstract = {Severe drought is the greatest recurring natural disaster to strike
North America. A remarkable network of centuries-long annual tree-ring
chronologies has now allowed for the reconstruction of past drought over
North America covering the past 1000 or more years in most regions.
These reconstructions reveal the occurrence of past ``megadroughts\{''\}
of unprecedented severity and duration, ones that have never been
experienced by modem societies in North America. There is strong
archaeological evidence for the destabilizing influence of these past
droughts on advanced agricultural societies, examples that should
resonate today given the increasing vulnerability of modem water-based
systems to relatively short-term droughts. Understanding how these
megadroughts develop and persist is a timely scientific problem. Very
recently, climate models have succeeded in simulating all of the major
droughts over North America from the Civil War to the severe 1998-2004
drought in the western U.S. These numerical experiments indicate the
dominating importance of tropical Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures
(SSTs) in determining how much precipitation falls over large parts of
North America. Of central importance to drought formation is the
development of cool ``La Nina-like\{''\} SSTs in the eastern tropical
Pacific region. This development appears to be partially linked to
changes in radiative forcing over that region, which affects the
Bjerknes feedback mechanism of the ENSO cycle there. Paradoxically,
warmer conditions over the tropical Pacific region lead to the
development of cool La Nina-like SSTs there, which is drought inducing
over North America. Whether or not this process will lead to a greater
prevalence of drought in the future as the world warms due to
accumulating greenhouse gases is unclear at this time. (c) 2007 Elsevier

coral delta O-18 records the effects of both
temperature and seawater delta O-18 variability due

signal propagating from the southwestern subtropical
Pacific to other regions. The results are consistent
with recent studies based on instrumental data and
with coupled climate model studies, in which
advection of thermal anomalies leads to El
Nino/Southern Oscillation-like variability on
decadal timescales. Additionally, there is evidence
for a significant shift in many of the time series,
along with a decrease in the decadal variability,
occurring in the early 1940s. Finally, the proxy

detailed information on fluctuations in

degrees N to 23 degrees N. delta O-18 values reflect
the amount of precipitation which is primarily
controlled by the mean latitudinal position of the
ITCZ and dynamics of the Indian summer monsoon
(ISM). During the early Holocene rapidly decreasing
6180 values indicate a rapid northward displacement
in the mean latitudinal position of the summer ITCZ
and the associated ISM rainfall belt, with decadal-
to centennial-scale changes in monsoon precipitation
correlating well with high-latitude temperature
variations recorded in Greenland ice cores. During
the middle to late Holocene the summer ITCZ
continuously migrated southward and monsoon
precipitation decreased gradually in response to
decreasing solar insolation, a trend, which is also
recorded in other monsoon records from the Indian
and East Asian monsoon domains. Importantly, there
is no evidence for an abrupt middle Holocene
weakening in monsoon precipitation. Although abrupt
monsoon events are apparent in all monsoon records,
they are short-lived and clearly superimposed on the
long-term trend of decreasing monsoon
precipitation. For the late Holocene there is an
anti-correlation between ISM precipitation in Oman
and inter-monsoon (spring/autumn) precipitation on
Socotra, revealing a possible long-term change in
the duration of the summer monsoon season since at
least 4.5 ka BP. Together with the progressive
shortening of the ISM season, gradual southward
retreat of the mean summer ITCZ and weakening of the
ISM, the total amount of precipitation decreased in
those areas located at the northern fringe of the
Indian and Asian monsoon domains, but increased in
areas closer to the equator. (c) 2006 Elsevier

atmospheric and oceanic circulation to increasing
greenhouse gases using a coordinated set of
twenty-first-century climate model experiments
performed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The
strength of the atmospheric overturning circulation
decreases as the climate warms in all IPCC AR4
models, in a manner consistent with the
thermodynamic scaling arguments of Held and
Soden. The weakening occurs preferentially in the
zonally asymmetric (i.e., Walker) rather than
zonal-mean (i.e., Hadley)component of the tropical
circulation and is shown to induce substantial
changes to the thermal structure and circulation of
the tropical oceans. Evidence suggests that the
overall circulation weakens by decreasing the
frequency of strong updrafts and increasing the
frequency of weak updrafts, although the robustness
of this behavior across all models cannot be
confirmed because of the lack of data. As the
climate warms, changes in both the atmospheric and
ocean circulation over the tropical Pacific Ocean
resemble "El Nino-like" conditions; however, the
mechanisms are shown to be distinct from those of El
Nino and are reproduced in both mixed layer and full
ocean dynamics coupled climate models. The character
of the Indian Ocean response to global warming
resembles that of Indian Ocean dipole mode
events. The consensus of model results presented

   abstract = {We investigate the roles of climate forcings and
chaos (unforced variability) in climate change via
ensembles of climate simulations in which we add
forcings one by one. The experiments suggest that
most interannual climate variability in the period
1979-1996 at middle and high latitudes is
chaotic. But observed SST anomalies, which
themselves are partly forced and partly chaotic,
account for much of the climate variability at low
latitudes and a small portion of the variability at
high latitudes. Both a natural radiative forcing
(volcanic aerosols) and an anthropogenic forcing
(ozone depletion) leave clear signatures in the
simulated climate change that are identified in
observations. Pinatubo aerosols warm the
stratosphere and cool the surface glc:,ally, causing
a tendency for regional surface cooling. Ozone
depletion cools the lower stratosphere, troposphere
and surface, steepening the temperature lapse rate
in the troposphere. Solar irradiance effects are
small, but our model is inadequate to fully explore
this forcing. Well-mixed anthropogenic greenhouse
gases cause a large surface warming that, over the
17 years, approximately offsets cooling by the other
three mechanisms. Thus the net calculated effect of
all measured radiative forcings is approximately
zero surface temperature trend and zero heat storage
in the ocean for the period 1979-1996. Finally, in
addition to the four measured radiative forcings, we
add an initial (1979) disequilibrium forcing of
+0.65 W/m(2). This forcing yields a global surface
warming of about 0.2 degrees C over 1979-1996, close
to observations, and measurable heat storage in the
ocean. We argue that the results represent evidence
of a planetary radiative imbalance of at least 0.5
W/m(2); this disequilibrium presumably represents
unrealized warming due to changes of atmospheric
composition prior to 1979. One implication of the
disequilibrium forcing is an expectation of new
record global temperatures in the next few
years. The best opportunity for observational
confirmation of the disequilibrium is measurement of
ocean temperatures adequate to define heat storage.},

driven by sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during the
twentieth century. At the same time SSTs showed a
marked long-term global warming (GW)
trend. Superimposed on this long-term trend decadal
and multi-decadal variability patterns are observed
like the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and
the inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Using
an atmospheric general circulation model we
investigate the relative contribution of each
component to the Sahelian precipitation
variability. To take into account the uncertainty
related to the use of different SST data sets, we
perform the experiments using HadISST1 and ERSSTv3
reconstructed sets. The simulations show that all
three SST signals have a significant impact over
West Africa: the positive phases of the GW and the
IPO lead to drought over the Sahel, while a positive
AMO enhances Sahel rainfall. The tropical SST
warming is the main cause for the GW impact on Sahel
rainfall. Regarding the AMO, the pattern of
anomalous precipitation is established by the SSTs
in the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. In turn,
the tropical SST anomalies control the impact of the
IPO component on West Africa. Our results suggest
that the low-frequency evolution of Sahel rainfall
can be interpreted as the competition of three
factors: the effect of the GW, the AMO and the
IPO. Following this interpretation, our results show
that 50% of the SST-driven Sahel drought in the
1980s is explained by the change to a negative phase
of the AMO, and that the GW contribution was
10%. In addition, the partial recovery of Sahel
rainfall in recent years was mainly driven by the
AMO.},

aspect of the analysis is that the ENSO influence
was quantified using a multiscalar drought
indicator, which allowed assessment of the role of
the ENSO phases on drought types affecting various
hydrological, agricultural and environmental
systems. The study was based on ENSO composites
corresponding to El Nino and La Nina phases, which
were obtained from the winter El Nino 3.4 index for
the period 1901-2006. Drought was identified in a
multiscalar way using the Standardized Precipitation
Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the global
SPEIbase data set. The study revealed the differing
impacts of the El Nino and La Nina phases on drought
severity, the time scales of droughts, and the
period of the year when the ENSO phases explained
drought variability worldwide. In large areas of
America and eastern Europe the role of ENSO events
were evident at the shortest time scales (1-3
months) at the beginning of events, but in areas of
South Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia the
effects were more obvious some months later, and at
longer time scales. We also identified areas where
severe drought conditions are associated with more
than 70% of ENSO events. The persistence of the
drought signal at longer time-scales (e.g., 6- or
12-months) is not directly determined by the
atmospheric circulation response to the SST
anomalies, since the SPEI anomalies will be caused
by the cumulative dry conditions in some specific
months. Knowledge of how these effects differ as a
function of the El Nino and La Nina phases, and how
they propagate throughout the drought time scales
could aid in the prediction of the expected drought
severity associated with the ENSO. Lags detected
during the study may help forecasting of dry
conditions in some regions up to one year before
their occurrence.},

the precipitation P and evaporation E, and the
moisture transport and divergence in the atmosphere
from the global atmospheric National Centers for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-NCAR reanalyses
produced with four-dimensional-data
assimilation. The moisture fields are summarized by
the precipitable water which is compared with
analyzed fields from NVAP based primarily on Special
Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) over the oceans and
rawinsonde measurements over land, plus TIROS
Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). The moisture
budgets are evaluated through computation of the
freshwater flux at the surface E - P from the
divergence of the total moisture transport, and this
is compared with the reanalysis E - P that is based
upon a 6-hour integration of the assimilating model
and thus depends on the model parametrizations. The
P field is evaluated using Xie-Arkin global
precipitation estimates which, although containing
considerable uncertainties, are believed to be
reliable and good enough to show that there are
substantial biases in the NCEP P. There are many
fields of interest and which are improved over
previous information available. On an annual mean
basis the largest evaporation of over 6 mm/day is in
the subtropical Indian Ocean. However, the NCEP
moisture fields are shown to contain large and
significant biases in the tropics. The tropical
structures are less well defined and values are
generally smaller where they should be high and
higher where they should be low. In addition, the
NCEP moisture fields contain less variability from
year to year. The NCEP model P generally reveals a
double intertropical convergence zone in the central
Pacific and the location of the South Pacific
Convergence Zone is not well captured. Rainfall
amounts are lower than observed in the oceanic
tropical convergence zones. The variability in the
central tropical Pacific of P associated with El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is underestimated
in the NCEP reanalyses and, moreover, is not very
well correlated with the Xie-Arkin product. A bias
for too much rainfall in the model over the
southeastern USA and southeast Asia is also present
in northern summer. The comparison of E - P from the
moisture budget with the model results reveal some
strong systematic differences. In particular,
remarkably, many island stations show up as
bull's-eyes in the difference held. These are
identified as originating from small but systematic
differences in vertical moisture profiles from those
in the surrounding oceans, raising questions about
the influence radius of rawinsonde moisture
observations. Biases in E are inferred from the E -
P differences in some places implying some spurious
land moisture sources. While usually better, the
residual method E - P estimates are inferior to
those from the model parametrizations in some
places. Both estimates are affected by biases in
moisture, as analyzed, and the moisture divergence
depends critically on the velocity divergence
held. The model estimates also depend upon the
parametrizations of subgrid scale processes, such as
convection, that influence E and P. A discussion is
given of sources of errors contributing to the
moisture budgets.},

the time-averaged intensify tau of the Pacific trade
winds, the mean depth (H) of the thermocline, and
the temperature difference across the thermocline

coupled ocean-atmosphere model indicates two
distinct families of unstable modes. One has long
periods of several years, involves sea surface
temperature variations determined by vertical
movements of the thermocline that are part of the
adjustment of the ocean basin to the fluctuating
winds, requires a relatively deep thermocline, and
corresponds to the delayed oscillator. The other
family requires a shallow thermocline, has short
periods of a year or two, has sea surface
temperature variations determined by advection and
by entrainment across the thermocline, and is
associated with westward phase propagation. For the
modes to be unstable, both families require that the
background zonal wind exceed a certain intensity. An
increase in DeltaT, and in H beyond a certain value,
are stabilizing. For intermediate values of H,
between large values that favor the one mode and
small values that favor the other, the modes are of

   abstract = {Transformative actions are increasingly being
required to address changes in climate. As an aid to
understanding and supporting informed
decision-making regarding transformative change, we
draw on theories from both the resilience and
vulnerability literature to produce the Adaptation
Action Cycles concept and applied framework. The
resulting Adaptation Action Cycles provides a novel
conceptualisation of incremental and transformative
adaptation as a continuous process depicted by two
concentric and distinct, yet linked, action learning
cycles. Each cycle represents four stages in the
decision-making process, which are considered to be
undertaken over relatively short timeframes. The
concept is translated into an applied framework by
adopting a contextual, actor-focused suite of
questions at each of the four stages. This approach
compliments existing theories of transition and
transformation by operationalising assessments at
the individual and enterprise level. Empirical
validation of the concept was conducted by
collaborating with members of the Australian wine
industry to assess their decisions and actions taken
in response to climate change. The contiguous stages
represented in the Adaptation Action Cycles aptly
reflected the diverse range of decision-making and
action pathways taken in recent years by those
interviewed. Results suggest that incremental
adaptation decision-making processes have distinct
characteristics, compared with those used in
transformative adaptation. We provide empirical data
to support past propositions suggesting dependent
relationships operate between incremental and
transformative scales of adaptation. (C) 2011

   abstract = {Droughts are one of the most devastating natural
hazards faced by the United States today. Severe
droughts of the twentieth century have had large
impacts on economies, society, and the environment,
especially in the Great Plains. However, the
instrumental record of the last 100 years contains
only a limited subset of drought realizations. One
must turn to the paleoclimatic record to examine the
full range of past drought variability, including
the range of magnitude and duration, and thus gain
the improved understanding needed for society to
anticipate and plan for droughts of the
future. Historical documents, tree rings,
archaeological remains, lake sediment, and
geomorphic data make it clear that the droughts of
the twentieth century, including those of the 1930s
and 1950s, were eclipsed several times by droughts
earlier in the last 2000 years, and as recently as
the late sixteenth century. In general, some
droughts prior to 1600 appear to be characterized by
longer duration (i.e., multidecadal) and greater
spatial extent than those of the twentieth
century. The authors' assessment of the full range
of past natural drought variability, deduced from a
comprehensive review of the paleoclimatic
literature, suggests that droughts more severe than
those of the 1930s and 1950s are likely to occur in
the future, a likelihood that might be exacerbated
by greenhouse warming in the next
century. Persistence conditions that lead to
decadal-scale drought may be related to
low-frequency variations, or base-state shifts, in
both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, although more
research is needed to understand the mechanisms of
severe drought.},

chronologies from overlapping segments of
cross-dated ring-width series is reviewed, with an
emphasis on preserving very low-frequency signals

fundamental statistical problem coined the 'segment
length curse' is introduced. This 'curse' is related
to the fact that the maximum wavelength of
recoverable climatic information is ordinarily
related to the lengths of the individual tree-ring
series used to construct the millennia-long
chronology. Simple experiments with sine waves are
used to illustrate this fact. This is followed by
more realistic experiments using a long bristlecone
pine series that is randomly cut into a number of
1000-, 500- and 200-year segments and standardized
using three very conservative methods. When compared
against the original, uncut series, the resulting
'chronologies' show the effects of segment length
even when the most conservative and noncommittal
method of tree-ring standardization is applied
(i.e., a horizontal line through the
mean). Alternative schemes of chronology development
are described that seek to exorcise the segment
length curse. While they show some promise, none is
universal in its applicability and this problem

When the anticyclones are best developed, during local summer, subsidence and equatorward advection on the eastern flanks of the anticyclones cool SSTs, while poleward flow on the western flanks warms SSTs. During local winter the SST asymmetry across the subtropical North Atlantic and North Pacific is maintained by warm water advection in the western boundary currents that offsets the large extraction of heat by advection of cold, dry air of the continents and by transient eddies. In the Southern Hemisphere ocean processes are equally important in cooling the eastern oceans by upwelling and advection during local winter.

southwest Western Australia (SWWA) in 2010 saw a
continuation of the multidecade-long winter drought

recorded positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM) value

positive SAM with anomalously low SWWA winter
rainfall (SWR), and vice-versa. However, such a
SAM-SWR teleconnection has been recently
questioned. Using observational data in the
post-1979 satellite era, it is shown that such a SAM
influence does exist. This coherence is confirmed
with 1150 years of modelled 20th century SWR
anomalies and SAM values from 23 climate models,
showing that a nonlinear impact operates: the
influence from a negative SAM is greater than that
from a positive SAM. This explains why a small
positive shift in the SAM can cause a large SWR
reduction, as has been observed. A further test
shows that models with a greater positive SAM trend
systematically produce a greater future SWR
reduction. As all climate models project an increase
in the SAM these results suggest that as global
warming continues unabated, SWWA winter droughts
will be more persistent as atmospheric conditions

Earth's climate system fluctuated in phase with the
11-year period signal in solar total irradiance
(STI) variability throughout the 20th century. The
QDO was associated with global average upper ocean
temperature variability dominated by the tropical
global average from 20 degrees S to 20 degrees
N. Earlier diagnosis of the tropical global average
oceanic thermal budget found the anomalous warming
tendency driven not by the radiative forcing
(similar to 0.15 W m(-2)) from the 11-year period
signal in STI but by the larger anomalous
quasi-decadal sensible plus latent heat flux
(similar to 0.5 W m(-2)) from the overlying
troposphere. Now we diagnose the corresponding
thermal budget of the tropical global average
atmospheric temperature variability, finding it
largest in the lower stratosphere (similar to 0.8
degrees K), decreasing downward into the lower
troposphere (similar to 0.15 degrees K) and the
upper ocean (similar to 0.05 degrees K). These
diagnostics find quasi- decadal temperature
variability in the tropical lower stratosphere
arising from a thermal balance between anomalous
radiative forcing (1.0 - 1.5 W m(-2)) by ozone
absorption of the 11-year signal in solar UV
irradiance variability (modified by absorption of
mean solar IR irradiance by volcanic aerosol
variability) and variable longwave radiation and
vertical advection. The latter two processes altered
the vertical gradient of equivalent potential
temperature in the tropical troposphere that allowed
mean vertical circulation to drive an anomalous
warming tendency in the lower troposphere. The
latter matched the amplitude and phase of the
downward quasi- decadal sensible plus latent heat
flux anomaly that drove the anomalous warming
tendency in the tropical global ocean.},

referred to as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation or
PDO. We include a historical overview and a summary
of observational work that describes the surface,
tropospheric and subsurface signatures of this

variability are incomplete at best, mostly due to
limitations in the observational record. We
emphasize that the well-known "ENSO-like" sea

eastern tropical Pacific, the SST maxima are
displaced north and south of the equator with larger
amplitudes in the northern branch near the coast of

for the troposphere-driven circulations. Several
mechanisms have been proposed to explain the PDO. We
review these mechanisms and models, which capture

have slightly better performance in simulating the
two types of El Ni\{ñ\}o event independently with
more distinct spatial patterns, compared to those in
CMIP3. It is demonstrated that the precipitation
response to Cold Tongue El Ni\{ñ\}o is one of the
important factors in simulating the two types of El
Ni\{ñ\}o independently in coupled models, and this
precipitation response is closely related to the dry
bias over the equatorial eastern Pacific.},

   abstract = {Climate variations on timescales longer than a year
are often characterized by temporal scaling
("power-law'') behavior for which spectral power
builds up at low frequencies, in contrast to
red-noise behavior for which spectral power
saturates at low frequencies. Checks on the ability
of climate prediction models to simulate temporal
scaling behavior represent stringent performance
tests on the models. We here estimate temporal
power-law exponents ("Hurst exponents'') for the
global atmospheric circulation of the stratosphere
and troposphere during the 20th century. We show
that current generation climate models generally
simulate the spatial distribution of the Hurst
exponents well. We then use simulations with
different climate forcings to explain the Hurst
exponent distribution and to account for
discrepancies in scaling behavior between different
observational products. We conclude that
characterization of temporal power-law behavior
provides a valuable tool for cross-validating
low-frequency variability in various datasets, for
elucidating the physical mechanisms underlying this
variability, and for statistical testing of trends
and periodicities in climate time series. Citation:

Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Drought
Working Group initiative were analyzed to determine
the impact of three patterns of sea surface
temperature (SST) anomalies on drought and pluvial
frequency and intensity around the world. The three
SST forcing patterns include a global pattern
similar to the background warming trend, a pattern
in the Pacific, and a pattern in the Atlantic. Five
different global atmospheric models were forced by
fixed SSTs to test the impact of these SST anomalies
on droughts and pluvials relative to a
climatologically forced control run. The five
models generally yield similar results in the
locations of drought and pluvial frequency changes
throughout the annual cycle in response to each
given SST pattern. In all of the simulations, areas
with an increase in the mean drought (pluvial)
conditions tend to also show an increase in the
frequency of drought (pluvial) events.
Additionally, areas with more frequent extreme
events also tend to show higher intensity
extremes. The cold Pacific anomaly increases drought
occurrence in the United States and southern South
America and increases pluvials in Central America
and northern and central South America. The cold
Atlantic anomaly increases drought occurrence in
southern Central America, northern South America,
and central Africa and increases pluvials in central
South America. The warm Pacific and Atlantic
anomalies generally lead to reversals of the drought
and pluvial increases described with the
corresponding cold anomalies. More modest impacts
are seen in other parts of the world. The impact of
the trend pattern is generally more modest than that
of the two other anomaly patterns.},

   abstract = {For the period 1987 to 1993, quantities central to
the global moisture budget from the global analyses
of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF), the U.S. National Meteorological
Center (NMC), and NASA/Goddard have been computed
and compared. The precipitable water is computed and
compared with satellite data from the Special Sensor
Microwave Imager (SSM/I). Fluxes of moisture and
their divergence have been used to estimate the
vertically integrated moisture budget and thus
evaporation minus precipitation (E - P) as
residuals. Results of several test computations show
that small biases exist in precipitable water as
vertical resolution and methods of computing
vertical integrals are changed, but the impact is
small on the moisture budget. In the Tropics and
subtropics the moisture budget is dominated by the
divergence field rather than the moisture amounts,
and consequently initialization of the analyses has
an impact on the perceived moisture budget. The
diurnal cycle is shown to be important especially
for E - P. For the vertically integrated moisture
budget, the use of pressure coordinates instead of
the model coordinates on which the data are analyzed
produces acceptably small differences for the most
part, although adequate resolution at low levels and
proper treatment of the surface is
important. Computations at different horizontal
resolutions reveal the importance of adequate
resolution in the vicinity of steep orography but
also that resolution is not a big factor on large
scales even where steep gradients in precipitation
exist. The implication is that it is the veracity bf
the large-scale divergence and moisture fields
themselves that contribute to problems, and these
arise from the moist physics of the assimilating
model used in four-dimensional data assimilation,
which dominates the character of the
analyses. However, in the subtropics large positive
biases are present in precipitable water in the
ECMWF and, to a lesser extent, NMC analyses and are
partly due to the assimilation of biased TOVS
retrievals. The effects of the large and spurious
changes in analysis systems at ECMWF and NMC are
manifested in the results. Differences between ECMWF
and NMC E - P locally are 60%-75% of the values
themselves in the Tropics at T31 resolution and
about one-half as much at T15 resolution, and they
are not diminishing with time. By making use of
estimates off and P from the NASA/Goddard
reanalysis, both spatial and temporal variability of
E - P are found to be dominated by the P
field. Accordingly, for part of 1987 and 1988,
estimates of precipitation from the Global
Precipitation Climatology Project are used to
qualitatively assess the E - P estimates. The ECMWF
estimates appear to be best at that time, but since
then the NMC values have become less intense while
the ECMWF estimates have greatly intensified. The
large differences that still exist in such estimates
are apt to be carried over to the NMC and ECMWF
reanalysis products.},

simulations to improve our understanding and
modeling of the climate of this region. The primary
data used in this study are the 1/8degrees gridded
temperature and precipitation based on station
observations and the NCEP - NCAR global
reanalyses. These data were used to evaluate a 20-yr
regional climate simulation performed using the
fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University -
National Center for Atmospheric Research (Penn State

conditions of the NCEP - NCAR reanalyses. Regional
climate features examined include seasonal mean and
extreme precipitation; distribution of precipitation
rates; and precipitation intensity, frequency, and
seasonality. The relationships between precipitation
and surface temperature are also analyzed as a means
to evaluate how well regional climate simulations
can be used to simulate surface hydrology, and
relationships between precipitation and elevation
are analyzed as diagnostics of the impacts of
surface topography and spatial resolution. The
latter was performed at five east - west transects
that cut across various topographic features in the
western United States. These analyses suggest that
the regional simulation realistically captures many
regional climate features. The simulated seasonal
mean and extreme precipitation are comparable to
observations. The regional simulation produces
precipitation over a wide range of precipitation
rates comparable to observations. Obvious biases in
the simulation include the oversimulation of
precipitation in the basins and intermountain West
during the cold season, and the undersimulation in
the Southwest in the warm season. There is a
tendency of reduced precipitation frequency rather
than intensity in the simulation during the summer
in the Northwest and Southwest, which leads to the
insufficient summer mean precipitation in those
areas. Because of the general warm biases in the
simulation, there is also a tendency for more
precipitation events to be associated with warmer
temperatures, which can affect the simulation of
snowpack and runoff.},

from region to region across the United States. We
provide strong evidence that spatial variations in
US temperature trends are linked to the hydrologic
cycle, and we also present unique information on the
seasonal and latitudinal structure of the
linkage. We show that there is a statistically
significant inverse relationship between trends in
daily temperature and average daily precipitation
across regions. This linkage is most pronounced in
the southern United States (30-40 degrees N) during
the May-June time period and, to a lesser extent, in
the northern United States (40-50 degrees N) during
the July-August time period. It is strongest in
trends in maximum temperatures (T-max) and 90th
percentile exceedance trends (90PET), and less
pronounced in the T-max 10PET and the corresponding
T-min statistics, and it is robust to changes in
analysis period. Although previous studies suggest
that areas of increased precipitation may have
reduced trends in temperature compared with drier
regions, a change in sign from positive to negative
trends suggests some additional cause. We show that
trends in precipitation may account for some, but
not likely all, of the cause point to evidence that
shows that dynamical patterns (El Nino/Southern
Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, etc.)
cannot account for the observed effects during
May-June. We speculate that changing aerosols,
perhaps related to vegetation changes, and increased
strength of the aerosol direct and indirect effect
may play a role in the observed linkages between
these indices of temperature change and the
hydrologic cycle.},

flowering, and leaf coloring, are closely associated
with lower atmospheric conditions as seasons
change. Plant phenology during springtime is
particularly sensitive to climatic factors,
especially temperature variations. Therefore, the
occurrence of specific plant events can be used to
identify the onset of spring. Advance or delay in
these timings can serve as potential climate change
detection measures over long periods. In this paper,
changes to spring's onset in Wisconsin were examined
using the first-bloom event of several introduced
and native species in t965-1998. Due to the
incompleteness of these observations, satellite data
were applied to derive 3 phenological regions across
the state. Next, average first-bloom time-series
were formed at this regional scale. Several
multi-species indices were then created based on
regional first-bloom variations. Trends toward
earlier first-bloom dates over the study period,
especially for early-spring species, were revealed
in the southwestern and central/eastern regions of
Wisconsin. Two of the most important aspects of our
study are: (1) phenology is regarded as a
multi-species problem that can be more easily
manipulated by reducing species variations to
several indices; and (2) satellite data, weather
data, and phenological observations are integrated
to create and validate phenological regions, a
process that can be used in other areas to
facilitate long-term phenological data
reconstruction.},

self-calibrating PDSI (sc_PDSI) and PDSI using
improved formulations for potential
evapotranspiration (PE), such as the Penman-Monteith
equation (PE_pm) instead of the Thornthwaite
equation (PE_th). Here I compare and evaluate four
forms of the PDSI, namely, the PDSI with PE_th

PE_th (sc_PDSI_th) and PE_pm (sc_PDSI_pm) calculated
using available climate data from 1850 to 2008. Our
results confirm previous findings that the choice of
the PE only has small effects on both the PDSI and
sc_PDSI for the 20th century climate, and the
self-calibration reduces the value range slightly
and makes the sc_PDSI more comparable spatially than
the original PDSI. However, the histograms of the
sc_PDSI are still non-Gaussian at many locations,
and all four forms of the PDSI show similar
correlations with observed monthly soil moisture (r
= 0.4-0.8) in North America and Eurasia, with
historical yearly streamflow data (r = 0.4-0.9) over
most of the world's largest river basins, and with
GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment)
satellite-observed water storage changes (r =
0.4-0.8) over most land areas. All the four forms of
the PDSI show widespread drying over Africa, East
and South Asia, and other areas from 1950 to 2008,
and most of this drying is due to recent
warming. The global percentage of dry areas has
increased by about 1.74% (of global land area) per
decade from 1950 to 2008. The use of the
Penman-Monteith PE and self-calibrating PDSI only
slightly reduces the drying trend seen in the
original PDSI. The percentages of dry and wet areas
over the global land area and six select regions are
anticorrelated (r = -0.5 to -0.7), but their
long-term trends during the 20th century do not
cancel each other, with the trend for the dry area
often predominating over that for the wet area,

importance on interannual time scales as well as for
the future response to warming oceans. Two patterns
stand out in our analysis of twentieth century
rainfall variability: a drying of the monsoon
regions, related to warming of the tropical oceans,
and variability related to the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation. The latest generation of climate models
partly captures this recent continent-wide drying
trend, attributing it to the combination of
anthropogenic emissions of aerosols and greenhouse
gases, the relative contribution of which is
difficult to quantify with the existing model
archive. The same climate models fail to reach a
robust agreement regarding the twenty-first century
outlook for African rainfall, in a future with
increasing greenhouse gases and decreasing aerosol
loadings. Such uncertainty underscores current
limitations in our understanding of the global
climate system that it is necessary to overcome if
science is to support Africa in meeting its
development goals.},

central Gulf of California during the past 15,000
years. Prior to similar to 6.2 ka, the eastern and
western Guaymas Basin proxy records were remarkably
similar. After conditions similar to those of today
during the Bolling-Allerod, the Younger Dryas (YD)
saw a major drop in diatom production, coincident
with increased calcium carbonate and tropical
microfossils suggestive of El Nino-like
conditions. Biosiliceous productivity began
increasing during the latter part of the YD, but it
was only daring the earliest Holocene (11.6 to 11.0
ka) that conditions similar to those of the
Bolling-Allerod returned to the central Gulf Between
around 11.0 and 6.2 ka, tropical diatoms and
silicoflagellates were virtually absent from the
central Gulf, as relatively cooler and fresher
surface waters resembling those of the modem
northern Gulf were present in the central
Gulf. Beginning at about 6.2 ka, tropical diatoms
and silicollagellates began increasing in the
central Gulf, and coccoliths returned to western
Gulf sediments. The onset of modem-day monsoon
conditions in the American Southwest required the
presence of warm SSTs in the northern Gulf, which
probably did not occur until after about 5.4 ka,
when tropical diatoms and silicoflagellates became
relatively common in the central Gulf. Modem
east-west contrasts, which arise from late
winter-early spring coastal upwelling on the
mainland side and lower diatom productivity on the
western side of the Gulf, commenced between 6.2 and
5.4 ka, possibly due to a shift in the direction of
late winter-early spring winds more towards the
southeast, or down the axis of the Gulf This
proposed wind shift might have ultimately been due
to a late Holocene strengthening of ENSO-like
conditions in the eastern equatorial
Pacific. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

animal events that take place at specific times each
year (phenology) should play an important role in
monitoring mid-latitude global changes. At least
three problems related to the detection of biosphere
changes could be investigated using this
information. Firstly, the technique can be
generalized from the local to global

developed to represent biome diversity
effectively. Lastly, physical mechanisms responsible
for the events can be deduced in order to
incorporate the phenological information into
global-scale models, and detect changes in related
environmental factors. With these goals in mind,
regional phenological data collection networks were
initiated in eastern North America during the early
1960s, using cloned lilacs and several species of
honeysuckle. This paper reviews research projects
which address the problems outlined above, using
first leaf data (associated with spring green-up or
''green wave'' in mid-latitudes) gathered from these

been hypothesized to be connected to anthropogenic

be consistent with multivariate red noise and hence
with stationary statistics. ENSO "flavors" are the
consequence of differing combinations of two
initially orthogonal spatial patterns that are
precursors to CP or EP events of both signs. These
precursors can be excited by random weather forcing

the Group Sunspot Number. The Group Sunspot Number
is designed to be more internally self-consistent
(i.e., less dependent upon seeing the tiniest spots)
and less noisy than the Wolf Sunspot Number. It uses
the number of sunspot groups observed, rather than
groups and individual sunspots. Daily, monthly, and
yearly means are derived from 1610 to the
present. The Group Sunspot Numbers use 65 941
observations from 117 observers active before 1874
that were not used by Wolf in constructing his time
series. Hence, we have calculated daily values of
solar activity on 111 358 days for 1610-1995,
compared to 66 168 days for the Wolf Sunspot
Numbers. The Group Sunspot Numbers also have
estimates of their random and systematic errors
tabulated. The generation and preliminary analysis
of the Group Sunspot Numbers allow us to make
several conclusions: (1) Solar activity before 1882
is lower than generally assumed and consequently
solar activity in the last few decades is higher
than it has been for several centuries. (2) There
was a solar activity peak in 1801 and not 1805 so
there is no long anomalous cycle of 17 years as
reported in the Wolf Sunspot Numbers. The longest
cycle now lasts no more than 15 years. (3) The Wolf
Sunspot Numbers have many inhomogeneities in them
arising from observer noise and this noise affects
the daily, monthly, and yearly means. The Group
Sunspot Numbers also have observer noise, but it is
considerably less than the noise in the Wolf Sunspot
Numbers. The Group Sunspot Number is designed to be
similar to the Wolf Sunspot Number, but, even if
both indices had perfect inputs, some differences
are expected, primarily in the daily values.},

   abstract = {The Murray-Darling Basin is Australia's food bowl
and home to many iconic water bodies that are
culturally and ecologically highly valued. The
recent Millennium Drought (from mid-1990s to 2009)
was the most severe hydrological drought since
records started in the late 19th century. It
severely impacted on the basin and for many acted as
a wake-up call. To address the ongoing declines in
water resources and environmental conditions and to
prepare the region for climate change, Australia's
Governments are currently attempting to introduce a
new comprehensive, and integrated approach to the
management of the basin's water resources. In this
paper, long-term time series of climate,
hydrological and environmental data are used to
analyze how compounding stresses have gradually
affected the hydrological system and its
services. Major hydroclimatic stresses considered in
this paper include salinity, water use, droughts,
and climate change. Other, more localized or minor
stresses exist (groundwater extraction, farm dams,
afforestation, bush fires, cyanobacterial blooms and
pollutants) and are reviewed more briefly. The
history of water policy and planning shows that
Government actions have been strongly influential on
the basin. A shift in the strategic goals from water
development to the protection and restoration of
environmental assets is noticeable since the mid
1990s. Median climate change projections by 2030
indicate smaller reductions in rainfall and runoff
than those observed during the recent Millennium
Drought, but have a relatively high uncertainty
attached to them. The use of regional approaches to
reduce that uncertainty, such as statistical
downscaling, points to a sizeable decline in
rainfall by the end of the century. Most climate
projections used for planning consider greenhouse
emission scenarios that have smaller global emission
trends than the one observed over the last
decade. Other, 'less optimistic' scenarios have to
be considered for long-term water planning and food
security. Compounding all these stresses, is the
naturally high hydroclimatic variability of this
semi-arid region, that may have been insufficiently
considered during previous water development and
planning efforts. Successful water planning will
need to balance cultural and ecological values with
food production, account for high natural
variability and uncertainty in climate change
projections, learn from past mistakes and be
cognizant of future hydrological changes. (C) 2011

Two mechanisms, the top-down stratospheric response of ozone to fluctuations of shortwave solar forcing and the bottom-up coupled ocean-atmosphere surface response, are included in versions of three global climate models, with either mechanism acting alone or both acting together. We show that the two mechanisms act together to enhance the climatological off-equatorial tropical precipitation maxima in the Pacific, lower the eastern equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures during peaks in the 11-year solar cycle, and reduce low-latitude clouds to amplify the solar forcing at the surface.},

The state of understanding about this topic as of early 2008 is reviewed, summarizing the past 30 years of work in the area, highlighting some very recent studies using climate models, and discussing methods used to deliver sulphur species to the stratosphere. The studies reviewed here suggest that sulphate aerosols can counteract the globally averaged temperature increase associated with increasing greenhouse gases, and reduce changes to some other components of the Earth system. There are likely to be remaining regional climate changes after geoengineering, with some regions experiencing significant changes in temperature or precipitation. The aerosols also serve as surfaces for heterogeneous chemistry resulting in increased ozone depletion. The delivery of sulphur species to the stratosphere in a way that will produce particles of the right size is shown to be a complex and potentially very difficult task. Two simple delivery scenarios are explored, but similar exercises will be needed for other suggested delivery mechanisms. While the introduction of the geoengineering source of sulphate aerosol will perturb the sulphur cycle of the stratosphere signicantly, it is a small perturbation to the total (stratosphere and troposphere) sulphur cycle. The geoengineering source would thus be a small contributor to the total global source of 'acid rain' that could be compensated for through improved pollution control of anthropogenic tropospheric sources. Some areas of research remain unexplored. Although ozone may be depleted, with a consequent increase to solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) energy reaching the surface and a potential impact on health and biological populations, the aerosols will also scatter and attenuate this part of the energy spectrum, and this may compensate the UVB enhancement associated with ozone depletion. The aerosol will also change the ratio of diffuse to direct energy reaching the surface, and this may influence ecosystems. The impact of geoengineering on these components of the Earth system has not yet been studied. Representations for the formation, evolution and removal of aerosol and distribution of particle size are still very crude, and more work will be needed to gain confidence in our understanding of the deliberate production of this class of aerosols and their role in the climate system.},

   abstract = {The North American monsoon is a seasonal shift of
upper- and low-level pressure and wind patterns that
brings summertime moisture into the southwest United
States and ends the late spring wet period in the
Great Plains. The interannual variability of the
North American monsoon is examined using the
NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (1948-98). The diurnal and
seasonal evolution of 500-mb geopotential height,
integrated moisture flux, and integrated moisture
flux convergence are constructed using a 5-day
running mean for the months May through
September. All of the years are used to calculate an
average daily Z score that removes the diurnal,
seasonal, and intraseasonal variability. The 30-day
average Z score centered about the date is
correlated with Pacific sea surface temperature
anomaly (SSTA) indices associated with the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North
Pacific oscillation (NPO). These indices are Nino-3,
a North Pacific index, and a Pacific index that
combines the previous two. Regional time-evolving
precipitation indices for the Southwest and Great
Plains, which consider the total number of wet or
dry stations in a region, are also correlated with
the SSTA indices. The use of nonnormally distributed
point source precipitation data is avoided.
Teleconnections are computed relative to the
climatological evolution of the North American
monsoon, rather than to calendar months, thus more
accurately accounting for the climatological changes
in the large-scale circulation. Tropical and North
Pacific SSTs are related to the occurrence of the
Pacific Transition and East Pacific teleconnection
patterns, respectively, in June and July. A high
(low) NPO phase and El Nino (La Nina) conditions
favor a weaker (stronger) and southward (northward)
displaced monsoon ridge. These teleconnection
patterns affect the timing and large-scale
distribution of monsoon moisture. In the Great
Plains, the spring wet season is lengthened
(shortened) and early summer rainfall and integrated
moisture flux convergence are above (below)
average. In the Southwest, monsoon onset is late
(early) and early summer rainfall and integrated
moisture flux convergence are below (above)
average. Relationships with Pacific SSTA indices
decay in the later part of the monsoon coincident
with weakening of the jet stream across the Pacific
and strengthening of the monsoon ridge over North
America. The most coherent summer climate patterns
occur over the entire western United States when the
Pacific index is substantially high or low, such as
during the Midwest flood of 1993 and drought of
1988. The Pacific index in spring is a good
predictor of early summer height anomalies over the
western United States when the time evolution of the
North Pacific SST dipole is considered.},

of high rainfall, is a major feature of subtropical
Southern Hemisphere climate and contributes to and
interacts with circulation features across the
Pacific, yet its past temporal variability and
forcing remain only partially understood. Here we
compare coral oxygen isotopic (delta(18)O) series
(spanning A.D. 1997-1780 and A.D. 2001-1776) from
two genera of hermatypic corals in Fiji, located
within the SPCZ, to examine the fidelity of these
corals in recording climate change and SPCZ
interdecadal dynamics. One of these coral records is
a new 225-year subannually resolved delta(18)O
series from the massive coral Diploastrea
heliopora. Diploastrea's use in climate
reconstructions is still relatively new, but this
coral has shown encouragingly similar interannual
variability to Porites, the coral genus most
commonly used in Pacific paleoclimate studies. In
Fiji we observe that interdecadal delta(18)O
variance is also similar in these two coral genera,
and Diploastrea contains a larger-amplitude
interdecadal signal that more closely tracks
instrumental-based indices of Pacific interdecadal
climate change and the SPCZ than Porites. Both coral
delta(18)O series record greater interdecadal
variability from similar to 1880 to 1950, which is
consistent with the observations of Folland et
al. (2002), who reported higher variability in SPCZ
position before 1945. These observations indicate
that Diploastrea will likely provide a significant
new source of long-term climate information from the
SPCZ region.},

assimilate proxy data into a climate reconstruction,
2) the proxy data network used, 3) the target
season, and 4) the spatial domain of the

temperature are formed through spatial averaging of
reconstructed temperature patterns that are based on
either the local calibration of proxy and
instrumental data or a more elaborate multivariate
climate field reconstruction approach. The
experiments compare results based on the global
multiproxy dataset used by Mann and coworkers, with
results obtained using the extratropical Northern
Hemisphere (NH) maximum latewood tree-ring density
set used by Briffa and coworkers. Mean temperature
reconstructions are compared for the full NH
(Tropics and extratropics, land and ocean) and
extratropical continents only, with varying target
seasons (cold-season half year, warm-season half
year, and annual mean). The comparisons demonstrate
dependence of reconstructions on seasonal, spatial,
and methodological considerations, emphasizing the
primary importance of the target region and seasonal
window of the reconstruction. The comparisons
support the generally robust nature of several
previously published estimates of NH mean
temperature changes in past centuries and suggest
that further improvements in reconstructive skill
are most likely to arise from an emphasis on the
quality, rather than quantity, of available proxy

earlywood width chronologies of Douglas fir from

the winter-spring precipitation variance in a linear
regression for 1949-1992, and there is strong
correlation between the tree-ring reconstructed
precipitation data and the observed precipitation
data not used for calibration (r = 0.74, p <

precipitation record were 1974, 1954, 1742, 1980,

of the hydrological cycle and water supply in the
region. A formal model-based detection and
attribution (D-A) study of these reductions is
performed. The detection variable is the ratio of 1
April snow water equivalent (SWE) to
water-year-to-date precipitation (P), chosen to
reduce the effect of P variability on the
results. Estimates of natural internal climate
variability are obtained from 1600 years of two
control simulations performed with fully coupled
ocean-atmosphere climate models. Estimates of the
SWE/P response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases,
ozone, and some aerosols are taken from
multiple-member ensembles of perturbation
experiments run with two models. The D-A shows the
observations and anthropogenically forced models
have greater SWE/P reductions than can be explained
by natural internal climate variability alone.
Model-estimated effects of changes in solar and
volcanic forcing likewise do not explain the SWE/P
reductions. The mean model estimate is that about
half of the SWE/P reductions observed in the west
from 1950 to 1999 are the result of climate changes
forced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, and
aerosols.},

of the Southern Oscillation changed from 1882 to
1995 was given by Trenberth and Hoar [1996], with a
focus on the unusual nature of the 1990-1995 El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) warm event in the
context of an observed trend for more EI Nino and
fewer La Nina events after the late 1970s. The
conclusions of that study have been challenged by
two studies which deal with only the part of our
results pertaining to the length of runs of
anomalies of one sign in the Southern Oscillation
Index. They therefore neglect the essence of
Trenberth and Hear, which focussed on the magnitude
of anomalies for certain periods and showed that
anomalies during both the post-1976 and
1990-mid-1995 periods were highly unlikely given the
previous record. With updated data through mid 1997,
we have performed additional tests using a
regression model with autoregressive-moving average
(ARMA) errors that simultaneously estimates the
appropriate ARMA model to fit the data and assesses
the statistical significance of how unusual the two
periods of interest are. The mean SOI for the
post-1976 period is statistically different from the
overall mean at < 0.05% and so is the 1990-mid-1995
period. The recent evolution of ENSO, with a major
new El Nino event underway in 1997, reinforces the
evidence that the tendency for more El Nino and
fewer La Nina events since the late 1970s is highly
unusual and very unlikely to be accounted for solely
by natural variability.},

   abstract = {North Pacific climate variability is characterized by pronounced band-limited multi-decadal (e.g., 20-40 years) variability and apparent regime shifts in instrumental sea level pressure and sea surface temperature (SST) records. This variability is commonly expressed in index form as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The state of the PDO has strong impacts on local climate along the North Pacific Rim, as well as on climate downstream across large parts of North America. The PDO is based on SST records that only extend back to the mid-19th century at best, with the most commonly used version of the index beginning in 1900. Robustly characterizing multi-decadal variability in such short records is a serious statistical challenge. In addition, the observed behavior of the PDO may be significantly contaminated by the effects of greenhouse warming, especially during the latter half of the 20th century. This makes the description of the PDO as a long-term natural mode of North Pacific climate variability uncertain as well. Annually resolved and exactly dated tree-ring records from western North America and sensitive to north Pacific climate variability and change can be used to extend the short instrumental PDO back several centuries to a millennium now. Several such PDO reconstructions exist now, each with robustly expressed long-term, band-limited, multi-decadal variability similar to that found in the instrumental data, but they do not all agree in the pre-1900 period not used for calibration. This appears to be due to systematic low-frequency differences between PDO reconstructions depending on the geographic locations of the tree-ring chronologies used, principally those north and south of 40°N. These differences appear to come and go back in time at near-centennial time scales. This suggests that the spatial impact of the PDO on North American climate varies over time in ways not possible to discern from the instrumental data. It also suggests that care must be taken in selecting which published PDO reconstruction is used for further studies of North Pacific climate variability.},

   abstract = {There are very few terrestrial palaeoclimate
archives spanning the Last Glacial Maximum through
the Holocene from coastal southern California. Yet,
knowledge of past climate dynamics is critical for
assessing present and future constraints on the
region's dwindling freshwater resources. We present
initial results from two drill cores extracted from
the present-day edge of Lake Elsinore, southern
California's largest natural lake. Using a
multiproxy approach including lithologic
description, mass magnetic susceptibility, LOI 550
degrees C (total organic matter), and LOI 950
degrees C (total carbonate), we infer first-order,
long-term climate change over the past 19 250
calendar years. Furthermore, we suggest possible
first-order forcing mechanisms that drive this
change, which include presence/absence of
continental ice sheets, insolation, and complex
ocean-atmosphere interactions. Our results indicate
four distinct millennial-scale climate modes over
the past 19 250 calendar years. These modes include
a wet Last Glacial Maximum (19 250-17 120 cal. yr
BP), a relatively dry late-Glacial/Holocene
transition (17120-9450 cal. yr BP), a wet early
Holocene (9450-7670 cal. yr BP), and a highly
variable mid-to-late Holocene climate (i.e.,
alternating wet/dry cycles; 7670 cal. yr
BP-present). We attribute the mid-to-late Holocene
climate interval to the onset of El Nino-Southern
Oscillation ca. 7000 cal. yr BP and a more vigorous
hydrologic system. These results are supported by a
variety of regional terrestrial and marine
palaeoclimate archives. Copyright (c) 2005 John

ocean sites the long-term correlations seem to
vanish at the equator and become nonstationary at
the Arctic and Antarctic circles. In the control run
the long-term correlations are less
pronounced. Compared with the historical run, the
correlation exponents are increased, and show a more
pronounced latitude dependence, visible also at
continental sites. When analyzing biannual averages,
we find stronger long-term correlations in the

   abstract = {The question of which statistical model best
describes internal climate variability on
interannual and longer time scales is essential to
the ability to predict such variables and detect
periodicities and trends in them. For over 30 yr the
dominant model for background climate variability
has been the autoregressive model of the first order
(AR1). However, recent research has shown that some
aspects of climate variability are best described by
a "long memory" or "power-law" model. Such a model
fits a temporal spectrum to a single power-law
function, which thereby accumulates more power at
lower frequencies than an AR1 fit. In this study,
several power-law model estimators are applied to
global temperature data from reanalysis
products. The methods employed (the detrended
fluctuation analysis, Geweke-Porter-Hudak estimator,
Gaussian semiparametric estimator, and multitapered
versions of the last two) agree well for pure
power-law stochastic processes. However, for the
observed temperature record, the power-law fits are
sensitive to the choice of frequency range and the
intrinsic filtering properties of the methods. The
observational results converge once frequency ranges
are made consistent and the lowest frequencies are
included, and once several climate signals have been
filtered. Two robust results emerge from the
analysis: first, that the tropical circulation
features relatively large power-law exponents that
connect to the zonal-mean extratropical circulation;
and second, that the subtropical lower stratosphere
exhibits power-law behavior that is volcanically
forced.},

   abstract = {A defining feature of Pacific decadal ENSO-like
variability is the similarity between its spatial
expression in sea surface temperature (SST) and the
spatial structure of interannual ENSO
variability. This similarity may indicate that the
decadal variability is merely a long-term average
over interannual ENSO variability. In contrast,
subtle differences (namely the meridionally
broadened tropical SST signature and emphasized
midlatitude SST anomalies for the decadal ENSO-like
pattern) may indicate that fundamentally different
processes are responsible for generating variability
on the decadal to interdecadal time scale. The
present study attempts to reconcile the subtly
different spatial structures of interannual ENSO and
decadal ENSO-like variability by relating the
decadal pattern to various SST patterns associated
with the development of the interannual ENSO
cycle. First, a statistical analysis is used to
reconstruct the decadal ENSO-like SST pattern as a
linear combination of interannual SST patterns. It
is shown that the decadal ENSO-like pattern is well
reconstructed in the absence of decadal spatial
information. Next, these interannual patterns are
physically interpreted in relation to the
interannual ENSO cycle. The analysis reveals that
the decadal ENSO-like SST pattern is obtained by
averaging over three SST patterns associated with
ENSO precursors, the peak of an ENSO event, and ENSO
"leftovers." The study provides a plausible
physical explanation for the spatial structure of
ENSO-like decadal variability as an average over
variations in the interannual ENSO cycle. The
results indicate that the prominent spatial features
of decadal ENSO-like variability are generated by
physical mechanisms that operate through the
interannual ENSO cycle. This does not imply,
however, that decadal processes are unimportant in
altering the decadal properties of ENSO. Results may
provide a framework for interpreting modeled decadal
ENSO-like variability and for constraining plausible
mechanisms of tropical decadal variability.},

relative to observations. Along the equator, the
models exhibit a robust, westward-propagating annual
cycle of SST and zonal winds. During boreal spring,
excessive rainfall south of the equator is linked to
an unrealistic reversal of the simulated meridional
winds in the east, and a stronger-than-observed
semiannual signal is evident in the zonal winds and
Equatorial Undercurrent. Both CM2.0 and CM2.1 have
a robust ENSO with multidecadal fluctuations in
amplitude, an irregular period between 2 and 5 yr,
and a distribution of SST anomalies that is skewed
toward warm events as observed. The evolution of
subsurface temperature and current anomalies is also
quite realistic. However, the simulated SST
anomalies are too strong, too weakly damped by
surface heat fluxes, and not as clearly phase locked
to the end of the calendar year as in
observations. The simulated patterns of tropical
Pacific SST, wind stress, and precipitation
variability are displaced 20 degrees-30 degrees west
of the observed patterns, as are the simulated ENSO
teleconnections to wintertime 200-hPa heights over
Canada and the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Despite
this, the impacts of ENSO on summertime and
wintertime precipitation outside the tropical

evaluated with a continuous baseline integration
driven by the NCEP Department of Energy (DOE) Second
Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project Reanalysis
(R-2). It is demonstrated that the CMM5 has a
pronounced downscaling skill for precipitation and
temperature interannual variations. The EOF and
correlation analyses illustrate that, for both
quantities, the CMM5 captures the spatial pattern,
temporal evolution, and circulation teleconnections
much better than the R-2. In particular, the CMM5
more realistically simulates the precipitation
pattern centered in the Northwest, where the
representation of the orographic enhancement by the
forced uplifting during winter (rainy season) is
greatly improved over the R-2. The downscaling
skill, however, is sensitive to the cumulus
parameterization. This sensitivity is studied by
comparing the baseline with a branch summer
integration replacing the Grell with the
Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme in the CMM5. The
dominant EOF mode of the U. S. summer precipitation
interannual variation, identified with the
out-of-phase relationship between the Midwest and
Southeast in observations, is reproduced more
accurately by the Grell than the Kain-Fritsch
scheme, which largely underestimates the variation
in the Midwest. This pattern is associated with
east-west movement of the Great Plains low-level jet
(LLJ): a more western position corresponds to a
stronger southerly flow bringing more moisture and
heavier rainfall in the Midwest and less in the
Southeast. The second EOF pattern, which describes
the consistent variation over the southern part of
the Midwest and the South in observations, is
captured better by the Kain-Fritsch scheme than the
Grell, whose pattern systematically shifts
southward.},

(SSTs). Over the past 60 years, the Indian Ocean
warmed two to three times faster than the central
tropical Pacific, extending the tropical warm pool
to the west by similar to 40A degrees longitude (>
4,000 km). This propensity toward rapid warming in
the Indian Ocean has been the dominant mode of
interannual variability among SSTs throughout the
tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans (55A degrees
E-140A degrees W) since at least 1948, explaining
more variance than anomalies associated with the El
Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In the atmosphere,
the primary mode of variability has been a
corresponding trend toward greatly increased
convection and precipitation over the tropical
Indian Ocean. The temperature and rainfall increases
in this region have produced a westward extension of
the western, ascending branch of the atmospheric
Walker circulation. Diabatic heating due to
increased mid-tropospheric water vapor condensation
elicits a westward atmospheric response that sends
an easterly flow of dry air aloft toward eastern
Africa. In recent decades (1980-2009), this response
has suppressed convection over tropical eastern
Africa, decreasing precipitation during the
'long-rains' season of March-June. This trend toward
drought contrasts with projections of increased
rainfall in eastern Africa and more 'El Nio-like'
conditions globally by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change. Increased Indian Ocean SSTs
appear likely to continue to strongly modulate the
Warm Pool circulation, reducing precipitation in
eastern Africa, regardless of whether the projected
trend in ENSO is realized. These results have
important food security implications, informing
agricultural development, environmental
conservation, and water resource planning.},

   abstract = {Stable water isotopes have been measured in a wide
range of climate archives, with the purpose of
reconstructing regional climate variations. Yet the
common assumption that the isotopic signal is a
direct indicator of temperature proves to be
misleading under certain circumstances, since its
relationship with temperature also depends on
e.g. atmospheric circulation and precipitation
seasonality. Here we introduce the principles,
benefits and caveats of using climate models with
embedded water isotopes as a support for the
interpretation of isotopic climate archives. A short
overview of the limitations of empirical
calibrations of isotopic proxy records is
presented. In some cases, the underlying hypotheses
are not fulfilled and the calibration contradicts
the physical interpretation of isotopic
fractionation. The simulation of climate and its
associated isotopic signal, despite difficulties
related to downscaling and intrinsic atmospheric
variability, can provide a 'transfer function'
between the isotopic signal and the considered
climate variable. The relationship between modelled
temperature and isotopic signal is analysed under
present-day, pre-industrial and mid-Holocene
conditions. The linear regression relationship is
statistically more significant for
precipitation-weighted annual temperature than mean
annual temperature, yet the regression slope varies
greatly between the time-slice
experiments. Temperature reconstructions that do not
account for the slope variations will in this case
underestimate the low-frequency variability and
overestimate high-frequency variability from the
isotopic proxy record. The spatial variability of
the simulated delta O-18-temperature slope further
indicates that the isotopic signal is primarily
controlled by synoptic atmospheric circulation
rather than local temperature.},

vital to evaluate the relative impacts of human
pollution and land surface modification on
climate. We have investigated one of the most
important natural causes of climate change, volcanic
eruptions, by using 54 ice core records from both
the Arctic and Antarctica. Our recently collected
suite of ice core data, more than double the number
of cores ever used before, reduces errors inherent
in reconstructions based on a single or small number
of cores, which enables us to obtain much higher
accuracy in both detection of events and
quantification of the radiative effects. We
extracted volcanic deposition signals from each ice
core record by applying a high-pass loess filter to
the time series and examining peaks that exceed
twice the 31-year running median absolute
deviation. We then studied the spatial pattern of
volcanic sulfate deposition on Greenland and
Antarctica and combined this knowledge with a new
understanding of stratospheric transport of volcanic
aerosols to produce a forcing data set as a function
of month, latitude, and altitude for the past 1500
years. We estimated the uncertainties associated
with the choice of volcanic signal extraction
criteria, ice core sulfate deposition to
stratospheric loading calibration factor, and the
season for the eruptions without a recorded
month. We forced an energy balance climate model
with this new volcanic forcing data set, together
with solar and anthropogenic forcing, to simulate
the large-scale temperature response. The results
agree well with instrumental observations for the
past 150 years and with proxy records for the entire
period. Through better characterization of the
natural causes of climate change, this new data set
will lead to improved prediction of anthropogenic
impacts on climate. The new data set of
stratospheric sulfate injections from volcanic
eruptions for the past 1500 years, as a function of
latitude, altitude, and month, is available for
download in a format suitable for forcing general
circulation models of the climate system.},

these processes are not orthogonal, and they
determine the spatial characteristics of the

processes is frequency dependent. At interannual
time scales, forcing from ENSO and the Aleutian low
determines the response in equal parts. At decadal
time scales, zonal advection in the Kuroshio-Oyashio

each account for similar amounts of the PDO

understanding of the functioning and variability of
the South American Monsoon System (SAMS) on time
scales varying from synoptic to long-term

one of the most prominent summertime climate

seasonal variability in a region lying between the
Amazon and the La Plata Basin. Much of the recent
progress is derived from complementary international
programs, such as the Monsoon Experiment South
America (MESA), as well as from ongoing
international programs such as the Large Scale
Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in the Amazon Basin
(LBA) and the La Plata Basin (LPB) Regional
Hydroclimate Project, which includes the CLARIS LPB
Europe-South America Network for Climate Change
Assessment and Impact Studies in La Plata Basin
Project. The latter assesses atmosphere-land surface
interactions, the role of land use changes and
aerosols from biomass burning considered as sources
of variability and change in the SAMS functioning,
characteristics and behaviour. The SAMS region is
particularly susceptible to variations of climate
due to the importance of hydroelectricity generation
and the agricultural base of local economies. Also
addressed in this report are projections of climate
change and extremes, which are important for impact
and vulnerability assessments. This discussion
includes the need to identify and understand
important processes that control the monsoonal
climate, how these processes may vary and change,
and how they may interact with key societal sectors,
including water resource management, hydroelectric
generation, agriculture, and agribusiness. This

   abstract = {The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has been
described by some as a long-lived El Nino-like
pattern of Pacific climate variability, and by
others as a blend of two sometimes independent modes
having distinct spatial and temporal characteristics
of North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST)
variability. A growing body of evidence highlights a
strong tendency for PDO impacts in the Southern
Hemisphere, with important surface climate anomalies
over the mid-latitude South Pacific Ocean, Australia
and South America. Several independent studies find
evidence for just two full PDO cycles in the past
century: "cool" PDO regimes prevailed from 1890-1924
and again from 1947-1976, while "warm" PDO regimes
dominated from 1925-1946 and from 1977 through (at
least) the mid-1990's. Interdecadal changes in
Pacific climate have widespread impacts on natural
systems, including water resources in the Americas
and many marine fisheries in the North
Pacific. Tree-ring and Pacific coral based climate
reconstructions suggest that PDO variations-at a
range of varying time scales-can be traced back to
at least 1600, although there are important
differences between different proxy
reconstructions. While 20th Century PDO fluctuations
were most energetic in two general periodicities-one
from 15-to-25 years, and the other from 50-to-70
years-the mechanisms causing PDO variability remain
unclear. To date, there is little in the way of
observational evidence to support a mid-latitude
coupled air-sea interaction for PDO, though there
are several well-understood mechanisms that promote
multi-year persistence in North Pacific upper ocean
temperature anomalies.},

Our study site (10\{degrees\}N) is climatically influenced by both summer (June--August) and spring (March--May) rainfall caused by the annual movement of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and modulated by large-scale anomalies in the atmospheric circulation and in ocean temperatures. Here we show that stalagmite growth, episodic throughout the last 7800 years, demonstrates decadal-scale (8--25 yr) variability in both growth rate and \{delta\} 18O. A hydrological model was employed and indicates that this decadal variability is due to variations in the relative amounts of rainfall in the two rain seasons. Our record, unique in its combination of length (a total of ~1000 years), annual chronology and high resolution \{delta\}18O, shows for the first time that such decadal-scale variability in rainfall in this region has occurred through the Holocene, which implies persistent decadal-scale variability for the large-scale atmospheric and oceanic driving factors.},

   abstract = {The process of a model adjusting to its forcing
(model spin-up) can severely bias land surface
simulations, and result in questionable land surface
model (LSM) output during the spin-up process. To
gain a better understanding of how spin-up processes
affect complex spatial and temporal land surface
modeling situations in general, and the
Retrospective North American Land Data Assimilation
System (NLDAS) simulations in particular, a
two-phase study was conducted. The first phase
examined results from Control, Wet, and Dry 11
year-long Mosaic simulations, while the second phase
attempted to explain spin-up behavior in NLDAS
Retrospective simulations from the Mosaic, Noah, VIC
and Sacramento LSMs based in part on the results
from phase 1. Total column and root zone soil
moisture spin up slowly, while evaporation and deep
soil temperature spin up more quickly. Mosaic soil
moisture initialization with NCEP/DOE Global
Reanalysis 2 (NCEP/DOE R-2) data (Control run) leads
to a faster spin-up time than saturated (Wet run) or
dry (Dry run) initialization, with the Control run
reaching equilibrium 1 to 2 years sooner than the
Wet run and 3 to 4 years more quickly than the Dry
run. Overall, practical drift of land surface stores
and output ceased in the Control run within
approximately 1 year, and fine-scale equilibrium was
reached within 5.5 years. Spin-up times exhibited
large spatial variability, and although no single
causal factor could be determined, they were
correlated most strongly with precipitation and
temperature forcing. In general, NLDAS models reach
a state of rough equilibrium within the first 1 to 2
years of the 3-year Retrospective simulation. The
Sacramento LSM has the shortest spin-up phase,
followed by the Mosaic, VIC, and Noah LSMs. Initial
NCEP/DOE R-2 conditions were too dry in general for
the VIC and Noah LSMs, and too moist for the Mosaic
and Sacramento LSMs. These results indicate that in
most cases, the 1-year spin-up time used in the
Retrospective NLDAS simulations eliminated spin-up
problems from the subsequent period that was used
for analysis.},

abundantly clear the need for a global perspective
in order to understand the nature and causes of
persistent regional precipitation
anomalies. Rainfall in the deep tropics is
particularly important as a forcing mechanism for
the atmosphere's large-scale circulation and
climate. Analysis of systematic space-based
observations and surface marine data over the past
three decades has vastly improved our understanding
of tropical convective regimes and their
relationship to surface conditions. The
characteristics of the annual cycle of tropical
convection and its relationship to sea surface
temperature field and the general circulation of the
tropics are reviewed. The hierarchal nature of
tropical precipitation variability on time/space
scales ranging from synoptic cloud clusters through
the intraseasonal Madden-Julian Oscillation to
multiyear El Nino-Southern Oscillation cycle is
discussed. Links between tropical convection and
extratropical precipitation on time scales ranging
from synoptic to multiyear are examined, with
emphasis on conditions over the North Pacific-North
American sector during winter. Precipitation
variability over a number of regions bordering the
Atlantic basin are related to Atlantic sector modes
of SST and circulation variability. Systematic modes
of Atlantic variability and their relationship to
regional precipitation variability are described
with emphasis on the tropics. Changes in landscape
characteristics (vegetative cover, soil moisture,
surface roughness), whether natural or human
induced, result in changes in the surface radiation
balance and the fluxes of heat and moisture. Our
current understanding of the role of land surface
processes in sustaining or intensifying anomalous
precipitation regimes is briefly
discussed. Identification of an anthropogenic trend
in the presence of decadal-scale natural variations
in precipitation is a formidable challenge. Three
examples of large-amplitude secular variations in
regional precipitation regimes (Sahel, North
American Great Plains, and India) are discussed in
terms of possible forcing mechanisms. Continuous
global monitoring of precipitation is a challenging
task. Satellite-based observations, in conjunction
with effective use of surface-based ''ground truth''
data and further development of four-dimensional
data assimilation methodology, offer the only
realistic prospects for significant improvement in
the monitoring and quantification of global
precipitation. Current methods for estimating
precipitation from space-based observations are
described and an overview of the upcoming Tropical
Rainfall Measurement Mission is included.},

terraced aggradational alluvial deposits indicate a
paucity of large floods in the Late Pleistocene and
at least five large flood events in the last c. 6
kyr, interpreted to mark an increased frequency of
extreme rainfall events in the middle Holocene
despite overall reduced EP. Increased EP in
south-central Australia during the early to middle
Holocene resulted from (1) decreased El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability, which
reduced the frequency of El Nino-triggered droughts,
(2) the prevalence of a more La Nina-like mean
climatic state in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which
increased available atmospheric moisture, and (3) a
southward shift in the Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ICTZ), which allowed tropical summer storms
associated with the Australian summer monsoon (ASM)
to penetrate deeper into the southern part of the
continent. The onset of heightened aridity and
apparent increase in large flood frequency at c. 5
ka is interpreted to indicate the establishment of
an ENSO-like climate in arid Australia in the late
Holocene, consistent with a variety of other
terrestrial and marine proxies. The broad
synchroneity of Holocene climate change across much

behavior suggests strong teleconnections amongst
ENSO and the other climate systems such as the ASM,

   abstract = {Precipitation over the southwestern United States
exhibits distinctive seasonality, and contrasting
ocean atmospheric dynamics are involved in the
interannual variability of cool- and warm-season
totals. Tree-ring chronologies based on annual-ring
widths of conifers in the southwestern United States
are well correlated with accumulated precipitation
and have previously been used to reconstruct cool-
season and annual precipitation totals. However,
annual-ring-width chronologies cannot typically be
used to derive a specific record of summer
monsoon-season precipitation. Some southwestern
conifers exhibit a clear anatomical transition from
the earlywood and latewood components of the annual
ring, and these exactly dated sub-annual ring
components can be measured separately and used as
unique proxies of cool- and warm-season
precipitation and their associated large-scale
ocean-atmospheric dynamics. Two 2139-yr-long
reconstructions of cool-(November-May) and
early-warm season (July) precipitation have been
developed from ancient conifers and relict wood at
El Malpais National Monument, New Mexico. Both
reconstructions have been verified on independent
precipitation data and reproduce the spatial
correlation patterns detected in the large-scale SST
and 500-mb height fields using instrumental
precipitation data from New Mexico. Above-average
precipitation in the cool- season reconstruction is
related to El Nino conditions and to the positive
phase of the Pacific decadal
oscillation. Above-average precipitation in July is
related to the onset of the North American monsoon
over New Mexico and with anomalies in the 500-mb
height field favoring moisture advection into the
Southwest from the North Pacific, the Gulf of
California, and the Gulf of Mexico. Cool- and
warm-season precipitation totals are not correlated
on an interannual basis in the 74-yr instrumental or
2139-yr reconstructed records, but wet winter-spring
extremes tend to be followed by dry conditions in
July and very dry winters tend to be followed by wet
Julys in the reconstructions. This antiphasing of
extremes could arise from the hypothesized cool- to
early-warm-season change in the sign of large-scale
ocean atmospheric forcing of southwestern
precipitation, from the negative land surface
feedback hypothesis in which winter-spring
precipitation and snow cover reduce surface warming
and delay the onset of the monsoon, or perhaps from
an interaction of both large-scale and regional
forcing. Episodes of simultaneous interseasonal
drought ("perfect'' interseasonal drought) persisted
for a decade or more during the 1950s drought of the
instrumental era and during the eighth- and
sixteenth-century droughts, which appear to have
been two of the most profound droughts over the
Southwest in the past 1400 yr. Simultaneous
interseasonal drought is doubly detrimental to
dry-land crop yields and is estimated to have
occurred during the mid-seventeenth-century famines
of colonial New Mexico but was less frequent during
the late-thirteenth-century Great Drought among the
Anasazi, which was most severe during the cool

subtropical South Pacific, 271-year long subseasonal
time series of Sr/Ca and delta(18)O were generated
from a coral growing at Rarotonga (21.5degreesS,
159.5degreesW). In this case, coral Sr/Ca appears to
be an excellent proxy for sea surface temperature
(SST) and coral delta(18)O is a function of both SST
and seawater delta(18)O composition
(delta(18)O(sw)). Here, we focus on extracting the
delta(18)O(sw) signal from these proxy records. A
method is presented assuming that coral Sr/Ca is
solely a function of SST and that coral delta(18)O
is a function of both SST and delta(18)O(sw). This
method separates the effects of delta(18)O(sw) from
SST by breaking the instantaneous changes of coral
delta(18)O into separate contributions by
instantaneous SST and delta(18)O(sw) changes,
respectively. The results show that on average
delta(18)O(sw) at Rarotonga explains similar to39%
of the variance in delta(18)O and that variations in
SST explains the remaining similar to61% of
delta(18)O variance. Reconstructed delta(18)O(sw)
shows systematic increases in summer months
(December-February) consistent with the regional
pattern of variations in precipitation and
evaporation. The delta(18)O(sw) also shows a
positive linear correlation with satellite-derived
estimated salinity for the period 1980 to 1997 (r =
0.72). This linear correlation between reconstructed
delta(18)O(sw) and salinity makes it possible to use
the reconstructed delta(18)O(sw) to estimate the
past interannual and decadal salinity changes in
this region. Comparisons of coral delta(18)O and
delta(18)O(sw) at Rarotonga with the Pacific decadal
oscillation index suggest that the decadal and
interdecadal salinity and SST variability at
Rarotonga appears to be related to basin-scale
decadal variability in the Pacific. Copyright (C)

Increases in precipitation or atmospheric humidity
ameliorate this enhanced demand, whereas decreases
exacerbate it. In the southwestern United States
(Southwest), this means the greatest changes in
evapotranspirational demand resulting from higher
temperatures could occur during the hot-dry
foresummer and hot-wet monsoon. Here seasonal
differences in surface climate observations are
examined to determine how temperature and moisture
conditions affected evapotranspirational demand
during the pronounced Southwest droughts of the
1950s and 2000s, the latter likely influenced by
warmer temperatures now attributed mostly to the
buildup of greenhouse gases. In the hot-dry
foresummer during the 2000s drought, much of the
Southwest experienced significantly warmer
temperatures that largely drove greater
evapotranspirational demand. Lower atmospheric
humidity at this time of year over parts of the
region also allowed evapotranspirational demand to
increase. Significantly warmer temperatures in the
hot-wet monsoon during the more recent drought also
primarily drove greater evapotranspirational demand,
but only for parts of the region outside of the core
North American monsoon area. Had atmospheric
humidity during the more recent drought been as low
as during the 1950s drought in the core North
American monsoon area at this time of year, greater
evapotranspirational demand during the 2000s drought
could have been more spatially extensive. With
projections of future climate indicating continued

during the hot-dry and hot-wet seasons possibly will
be more severe in future droughts and result in more

disproportionate amount negatively impacting

region, extending over 12,000 km(2) or more; aerial
and field surveys confirmed the general extent of
the die-off. Notably, the recent drought was warmer
than the previous subcontinental drought of the
1950s. The limited, available observations suggest
that die-off from the recent drought was more
extensive than that from the previous drought,
extending into wetter sites within the tree species'
distribution. Our results quantify a trigger leading
to rapid, drought-induced die-off of overstory woody
plants at subcontinental scale and highlight the
potential for such die-off to be more severe and
extensive for future global-change-type drought
under warmer conditions.},

We present results from Experiment G1 of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, in which 12 climate models have simulated the climate response to an abrupt quadrupling of CO2 from preindustrial concentrations brought into radiative balance via a globally uniform reduction in insolation. Models show this reduction largely offsets global mean surface temperature increases due to quadrupled CO2 concentrations and prevents 97% of the Arctic sea ice loss that would otherwise occur under high CO2 levels but, compared to the preindustrial climate, leaves the tropics cooler (−0.3 K) and the poles warmer (+0.8 K). Annual mean precipitation minus evaporation anomalies for G1 are less than 0.2 mm day−1 in magnitude over 92% of the globe, but some tropical regions receive less precipitation, in part due to increased moist static stability and suppression of convection. Global average net primary productivity increases by 120% in G1 over simulated preindustrial levels, primarily from CO2 fertilization, but also in part due to reduced plant heat stress compared to a high CO2 world with no geoengineering. All models show that uniform solar geoengineering in G1 cannot simultaneously return regional and global temperature and hydrologic cycle intensity to preindustrial levels.},

analysis. Five significant frequency bands are
isolated ranging from the quasi biennial to the
quasi decadal. Two quasi-biennial bands are centered
around 2.2- and 2.7-yr periods: two interannual
bands are centered around 3.5- and 4.4-yr periods;
the fifth band at the quasi-decadal frequency is
centered around 11.4-yr period. Between 1920 and
1955, the quasi-decadal band is less prominent
compared to the quasi-biennial bands. This happens
to be the period when SLP gradually increased over
the Greenland-Iceland regions. The spatial pattern
at the quasi-decadal frequency displays an
out-of-phase relationship in the SLP in the vicinity
of the subtropical anticyclones in both hemispheres
(indicative of an out-of-phase quasi-decadal
variability in the North and South Atlantic Hadley
circulation). The quasi-decadal frequency also
displays an out-of-phase relationship in the SSTs
north and south of the mean position of the
intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). This
short-lived structure, lasting for approximately two
years, supports the argument that a tropical SST
dipole pattern is one of the characteristics of the
quasi-decadal signal. All five frequency bands
represent to some extent fluctuations of the North
Atlantic oscillation and are associated with
tropical Atlantic Ocean warming (cooling) with
different spatial evolution. The two interannual
bands show opposite SST evolution to the south of
the ITCZ, that is, southeastward evolution from the
western tropical Atlantic for the 3.5-yr period and
westward spreading from the eastern tropical
Atlantic for the 4.4-yr period. Moreover, a
significant coherence (with a 1-yr phase lag) is
found between the SST time series along the
equatorial Atlantic obtained from the 3.5-yr period,
and the SST time series in the NINO3 area in the
Pacific. It is cautiously argued that the 3.5-yr
period is largely associated with the global El
Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. while the
evolution of the 4.4-yr period depends more upon
Atlantic local conditions.},

(SH) warms by 1.12 degrees C/0.84 degrees C over the

reflects past sea-surface temperature (SST)
variability on seasonal to multidecadal scales. To
validate the SST reconstructions derived from oxygen
isotopes, Sr/Ca ratios were obtained for selected
time windows (1973-1995, 18631910, 1784-1809,

coolest period of the entire record with anomalies

Minimum (1675-1710). The warmest periods, as
indicated by our data, occur between 1880 and 1900

We generated a time series of coral 6180 for
different seasons of the year to investigate austral
winter and summer SST variability that influences
rainfall intensity over southern Africa. Winter
coral 6180 is coherent with winter SST on decadal

Mozambique Channel/Agulhas Current region over 336

events, occurring during austral summer, are
displayed in the Italy record. The austral summer
coral 6180 is coherent and in phase with ENSO

strong between 1680-1720 and 1760-1790, in agreement
with other studies. We show evidence that those
variations are caused by changes in the regional

   abstract = {A physically based conceptual framework is put
forward that explains why an increase in heavy
precipitation events should be a primary
manifestation of the climate change that accompanies
increases in greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere. Increased concentrations of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere increase downwelling
infrared radiation, and this global heating at the
surface not only acts to increase temperatures but
also increases evaporation which enhances the
atmospheric moisture content. Consequently all
weather systems, ranging from individual clouds and
thunderstorms to extratropical cyclones, which feed
on the available moisture through storm-scale
moisture convergence, are likely to produce
correspondingly enhanced precipitation
rates. Increases in heavy rainfall at the expense of
more moderate rainfall are the consequence along
with increased runoff and risk of flooding. However,
because of constraints in the surface energy budget,
there are also implications for the frequency and/or
efficiency of precipitation. It follows that
increased attention should be given to trends in
atmospheric moisture content, and datasets on hourly
precipitation rates and frequency need to be
developed and analyzed as well as total

After surveying nearly 2200 ring-width records, we find the spatial structure of tree–climate relations across the hemisphere matches behavior predicted several decades ago very closely, confirming the principles that guide dendroclimatology are robust despite the complexity of interactions between climate, ecology and tree biology. We also show that climate filtering conducted by individual trees creates major regional differences in information that may be recovered from the hemispheric network. This behavior can introduce geographic biases to dendroclimatic reconstructions, but it also may be useful to evaluate the success of reconstruction techniques that explicitly represent the physical processes linking climate to tree growth.},

A major unresolved issue relating to internal climate dynamics is the mode and tempo of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation variability, and the significance of decadal-to-centennial scale changes in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength in regulating the climate of the last millennium. Here we use the time-constrained high-resolution local radiocarbon reservoir age offset derived from an absolutely dated annually resolved shell chronology spanning the past 1,350 years, to reconstruct changes in surface ocean circulation and climate. The water mass tracer data presented here from the North Icelandic shelf, combined with previously published data from the Arctic and subtropical Atlantic, show that surface Atlantic meridional overturning circulation dynamics likely amplified the relatively warm conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the relatively cool conditions during the Little Ice Age within the North Atlantic sector.},

confirm the literature regression of delta(18)O

is generally well represented by individual coral
time series, observed decadal and secular
variability does not always display a linear
relationship to local SST anomaly. Instead, many
records appear to better recover nonlocal,
large-scale phenomena, which in turn are related to
either the coral local SST or SST covariant changes
in seawater delta(18)O. We employ empirical
orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to identify
common patterns of variability in the coral data. We
find two significant patterns which are
interpretable as the oceanographic signature of the
El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and as a
near-global warming in which the eastern equatorial
Pacific cools. A third pattern weakly resembles the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation. These modes are seen
more clearly in a singular Vector decomposition
(SVD) of the covariance between the coral data and
the dominant patterns of large-scale historical SST
variability. The results are consistent with those
found in EOF and SVD analyses of SST data from the
coral locations. As additional coral-based proxy
estimates become available, they will improve the
resolution of the patterns recovered. These results
suggest that a sparse network of coral data may be
used to reconstruct interannual, secular, and
decadal SST variability for preinstrumental periods,
albeit with large uncertainty.},

   abstract = {The current consensus is that drought has developed
in the Sahel during the second half of the twentieth
century as a result of remote effects of oceanic
anomalies amplified by local land-atmosphere
interactions. This paper focuses on the impacts of
oceanic anomalies upon West African climate and
specifically aims to identify those from SST
anomalies in the Pacific/Indian Oceans during spring
and summer seasons, when they were
significant. Idealized sensitivity experiments are
performed with four atmospheric general circulation
models (AGCMs). The prescribed SST patterns used in
the AGCMs are based on the leading mode of
covariability between SST anomalies over the
Pacific/Indian Oceans and summer rainfall over West
Africa. The results show that such oceanic anomalies
in the Pacific/Indian Ocean lead to a northward
shift of an anomalous dry belt from the Gulf of
Guinea to the Sahel as the season advances. In the
Sahel, the magnitude of rainfall anomalies is
comparable to that obtained by other authors using
SST anomalies confined to the proximity of the
Atlantic Ocean. The mechanism connecting the
Pacific/Indian SST anomalies with West African
rainfall has a strong seasonal cycle. In spring (May
and June), anomalous subsidence develops over both
the Maritime Continent and the equatorial Atlantic
in response to the enhanced equatorial
heating. Precipitation increases over continental
West Africa in association with stronger zonal
convergence of moisture. In addition, precipitation
decreases over the Gulf of Guinea. During the
monsoon peak (July and August), the SST anomalies
move westward over the equatorial Pacific and the
two regions where subsidence occurred earlier in the
seasons merge over West Africa. The monsoon weakens
and rainfall decreases over the Sahel, especially in
August.},

   abstract = {This paper is devoted to illustrating new wavelet
analysis methods in the field of hydrology. New
wavelet indicators are applied to long-term
hydrological and climatologic proxies. They are
first applied to four Atlantic large river monthly
discharges (Amazon, Parana, Orinoco and Congo) and
then applied to two well-known long-term
climatologic indexes: the Southern Oscillation and
the North Atlantic Oscillation. This approach makes
it possible to suggest physical explanations for
time-scale dependant relationships. Six-month
variability is present in all the rivers except in
the Parana. In the Congo River this signal is near
stationary with strong entropy. The strength of this
scale coincides with higher discharge variability
before 1920 and over the Orinoco basin with higher
discharge values between 1940 and 1955. An annual
cycle is present in all the rivers but is much
stronger, along with the entropy, in the rivers with
a large tropical basin, as in the Amazon and the
Orinoco. This annual signal is not permanent in the
Congo and much more intermittent in the Parana where
the annual recharge appears as very irregular. A
quasi biennial variability is apparent in all the
equator ward rivers and a nearly permanent 2-year
coherence is found between Sol and the Amazon
discharge. A 3-6year oscillation typical of ENSO
variability is observed in all the rivers. It is
intermittent, observed before 1930 in all the rivers
and after 1980 mostly in the Amazon River. These
peaks of activity correspond to periods of major Sol
variability. An 8-year variability is particularly
strong in the Parana River before 1940 and around
1970 and to a lesser extent in the Orinoco River
during the low NAO index period, between 1940 and
1970. The Congo River exhibits that time-scale
around 1970. A 13-year variability common to Sol,
NAO and the South Atlantic Ocean circulation is
observed in the Parana and Congo discharges. In all
the rivers the greatest entropy is observed at bi
and multi decadal time scales with the greatest
coherence with both NAO and Sol. A near 20-year
time-scale is observed in most of the series around
1970, although it is strongest in Amazon and Parana
discharges. Finally, a 30-year time-scale is
observed between 1940 and 1970. It is to be noted
that most of the time-scale dominant activities, in
all the rivers, may have been influenced by the
interdecadal shifts that took place around 1940 and
1970 in the Pacific and in the Atlantic.},

is performed of the full three-dimensional spatial
structure of the temperature field monthly mean
anomalies from the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40)
for a core region of the Tropics from 30 degrees N
to 30 degrees S, with results projected
globally. The focus is on the first three empirical
orthogonal functions (EOFs), two of which have
primary relationships to El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and feature rather different
vertical structures. The second (EOF-2) also has a
weak ENSO signature but a very complex vertical
structure and reflects mainly nonlinear trends, some
real but also some in large part spurious and
associated with problems in assimilating satellite
data. The dominant pattern (EOF-1) in its positive
sign features highly coherent zonal mean warming
throughout the tropical troposphere from 30 degrees
N to 30 degrees S that increases in magnitude with
height to 300 hPa, drops to zero about 100 hPa at
the tropopause, and has reverse sign to 30 hPa with
peak negative values at 70 hPa. Spatially at low
levels it shows warmth throughout most of the
Tropics although with weak or slightly opposite sign
in the western tropical Pacific and a strong
reversed sign in the Pacific subtropics. Coherent
wave structures below 700 hPa at higher latitudes
cancel out in the zonal mean. However, the structure
becomes more zonal above about 700 hPa and features
off-equatorial maxima straddling the equator in the
eastern Pacific in the upper troposphere with
opposite sign at 100 hPa, as a signature of a forced
Rossby wave. The corresponding sea level pressure
pattern is similar to but more focused in equatorial
regions than the Southern Oscillation pattern. The
time series highlights the 1997/98 El Nino along
with those in 1982/83 and 1986/87, and the 1988/89
La Nina, and correlates strongly with global mean
surface temperatures. Missing, however, is the
prolonged sequence of three successive El Nino
events in the early 1990s, which are highlighted in
EOF-3 as part of a mainly lower-frequency decadal
variation that features modest zonal mean warming
below 700 hPa, cooling from 700 to 300 hPa, and
warming above 300 hPa, peaking at 100 hPa and
extending from 40 degrees N to 50 degrees
S. Spatially at the surface this pattern is
dominated by Southern Oscillation wave-1 structures
throughout the Tropics and especially the
subtropics. The regional temperature structures are
coherent throughout the troposphere, with strongest
values in the Pacific and extending well into the
extratropics, with a sign reversal at and above 100
hPa. Strong Rossby wave signatures are featured in
the troposphere with a distinctive quadrupole
pattern that reverses at 100 hPa. The vertical
coherence of all patterns suggests that they should
be apparent in broad-layer satellite temperature
records but that stratospheric anomalies are not
independent. The quite different three-dimensional
structure of these different patterns highlights the
need to consider the full structure outside of the
Pacific and at all vertical levels in accounting for
impacts of ENSO, and how they relate to the global
mean.},

scientific interest and have significant
consequences for our understanding of natural and

large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the
distribution-the part of the distribution
representing large but rare events-and by the
difficulty of identifying the range over which
power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for
analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares
fitting, can produce Substantially inaccurate
estimates of parameters for power-law distributions,
and even in cases where such methods return accurate
answers they are still unsatisfactory because they
give no indication of whether the data obey a power

maximum-likelihood fitting methods with
goodness-of-fit tests based on the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood
ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
approach with tests on synthetic data, and give
critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also
apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world

Fourier spectra of various solar-terrestrial
records, the 88-year cycle is unique, because it can
be directly linked to the cyclic activity of sunspot
formation. Variations of amplitude as well as of
period of the Schwabe 11-year cycle of sunspot
activity have actually been known for a long time
and a ca. 80-year cycle was detected in those
variations. Manifestations of such secular periodic
processes were reported in a broad variety of solar,
solar-terrestrial, and terrestrial climatic
phenomena. Confirmation of the existence of the
Gleissberg cycle in long solar terrestrial records
as well as the question of its stability is of great
significance for solar dynamo theories. For that
perspective, we examined the longest detailed
cosmogenic isotope record-INTCAL98 calibration
record of atmospheric C-14 abundance. The most
detailed precisely dated part of the record extends
back to 11, 854 years B. P. During this whole
period, the Gleissberg cycle in C-14 concentration
has a period of 87.8 years and an average amplitude
of similar to1parts per thousand (in Delta(14)C
units). Spectral analysis indicates in frequency
domain by sidebands of the combination tones at
periods of approximate to91.5 +/- 0.1 and
approximate to84.6 +/- 0.1 years that the amplitude
of the Gleissberg cycle appears to be modulated by
other long-term quasiperiodic process of timescale
similar to2000 years. This is confirmed directly in
time domain by bandpass filtering and time-frequency
analysis of the record. Also, there is additional
evidence in the frequency domain for the modulation
of the Gleissberg cycle by other millennial scale
processes. Attempts have been made to explain 20th
century global warming exclusively by the component
of irradiance variation associated with the
Gleissberg cycle. These attempts fail, because they
require unacceptably great solar forcing and are
incompatible with the paleoclimatic records.},

These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountain top species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.},

   abstract = {[1] Interannual variability of the atmospheric heat
budget is explored via a new data set of the
computed vertically integrated energy transports to
examine relationships with other fields. A case
study reveals very large monthly divergences of
these transports regionally with El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and the associated changes with
the Pacific-North American teleconnection pattern,
and with the North Atlantic Oscillation. In the
tropical Pacific during large El Nino events the
anomalous divergence of the atmospheric energy
transports exceeds 50 W m(-2) over broad regions for
several months. Examination of the corresponding
top-of-the-atmosphere net radiative fluxes shows
that it is primarily the surface fluxes from the
ocean to the atmosphere that feed the divergent
atmospheric transports. A systematic investigation
of the covariability of sea surface temperatures
(SSTs) and the divergence of atmospheric energy
transport, using singular value decomposition
analysis of the temporal covariance, reveals ENSO as
dominant in the first two modes, explaining 62% and
12% of the covariance in the Pacific domain and
explaining 39.5% and 15.4% globally for the first
and second modes, respectively. The first mode is
well represented by the time series for the SST
index for Nino 3.4 region (170degreesW-120degreesW,
5degreesN-5degreesS). Regression analysis allows a
more complete view of how the SSTs, outgoing
longwave radiation, precipitation, diabatic heating,
and atmospheric circulation respond with ENSO. The
second mode indicates aspects of the systematic
evolution of ENSO with time, with strong lead and
lag correlations. It primarily reflects differences
in the evolution of ENSO across the tropical Pacific
from about the dateline to coastal South
America. High SSTs associated with warm ENSO events
are damped through surface heat fluxes into the
atmosphere, which transports the energy into higher
latitudes and throughout the tropics, contributing
to loss of heat by the ocean, while the cold ENSO
events correspond to a recharge phase as heat enters
the ocean. Diabatic processes are clearly important
within ENSO evolution.},

   abstract = {The effect of air-sea coupling on tropical climate
variability is investigated in a coupled linear
inverse model (LIM) derived from the simultaneous
and 6-day lag covariances of observed 7-day running
mean departures from the annual cycle. The model
predicts the covariances at all other lags. The
predicted and observed lag covariances, as well as
the associated power spectra, are generally found to
agree within sampling uncertainty. This validates
the LIM's basic premise that beyond daily time
scales, the evolution of tropical atmospheric and
oceanic anomalies is effectively linear and
stochastically driven. It also justifies a linear
diagnosis of air-sea coupling in the system. The
results show that air-sea coupling has a very small
effect on subseasonal atmospheric variability. It
has much larger effects on longer-term variability,
in both the atmosphere and the ocean, including
greatly increasing the amplitude of ENSO and
lengthening its dominant period from 2 to 4
years. Consistent with these results, the
eigenvectors of the system's dynamical evolution
operator also separate into two distinct, but
nonorthogonal, subspaces: one governing the nearly
uncoupled subseasonal dynamics and the other
governing the strongly coupled longer-term
dynamics. These subspaces arise naturally from the
LIM analysis; no bandpass frequency filtering need
be applied. One implication of this remarkably clean
separation of the uncoupled and coupled dynamics is
that GCM errors in anomalous tropical air-sea
coupling may cause substantial errors on interannual
and longer time scales but probably not on the
subseasonal scales associated with the MJO.},

resolution from a topographically closed (but
hydrologically open) lake basin was used to
reconstruct changes in lake salinity and evaporative
intensity and to evaluate the reliability of
different proxies for inferring climatic change in
the glaciated Northern Great Plains (NGP). At Rice
Lake, North Dakota, the ostracode-Mg/Ca ratios show
good correlation with other ostracode, diatom and
aeolian proxy records from other sites in the
NGP. All of these records show significant
century-scale periodicities, which have been related
to solar variability as inferred from atmospheric
radiocarbon records. This coherent and consistent
pattern suggests that these sites record climatic
variability at regional scales. The interval of the
Mediaeval Climatic Anomaly from similar to900 to 550
cal. yr BP contains two pronounced dry
periods. During the following 'Little Ice Age', a
single period of frequent drought that peaked at
similar to300 cal. yr BP was bracketed by wet
periods before and after. In contrast, the
ostracode-Sr/Ca ratios and ostracode- and
mollusc-records from Rice Lake have different
patterns and do not correlate well with each other
or with the same proxies at other sites. This lack
of consistent pattern within a site and among
several regional sites suggests seasonal and/or
site-specific influences on these proxies. Variable
contributions of groundwater, with low delta(18)O
values because of selective recharge from snowmelt,
may have played an important role in determining the
isotopic composition of the lake. The poor
correlation of Sr/Ca with other proxies is caused by
mediation of inorganic carbonate mineralogy, owing
to active uptake of Sr in the formation of inorganic
aragonite. Thus, our sediment data along with
present-day lakewater chemistry suggest that
carbonate-delta(18)O records in the NGP cannot be
interpreted simply in terms of climate because of
significant local groundwater
influences. Ostracode-Mg/Ca ratios tend to be a
better indicator of past salinity because of the
conservative nature of Mg in oligosaline waters

   abstract = {We determine the structure of a network of sites
from which coral-based, proxy measurements of sea
surface temperature (SST) variability minimize the
error in a reconstruction of the large-scale
features of the global SST field. For a wide range
of coral-derived SST observational error and several
minimization criteria, sites in the equatorial
oceans, especially the central and eastern
equatorial Pacific, best minimize the error in the
reconstruction. If the observational error is
sufficiently low, additional optimal sites are in
selected subtropical lo,cations. If the
observational error is high, the error is minimized
by resampling the most important equatorial
sites. The marginal return on additional sites
diminishes rapidly and is not sensitive to the size
of the observational error: two sites reduce the
analysis error by half as much as 10 sites, while
the first 6-7 sites achieve half the error reduction
of all 65 sites in the analysis domain. In the
extratropics the reduction of reconstruction error
is small and gradual, while error in the tropical
Pacific is sharply reduced by 2-3 sites and
gradually thereafter. These results suggest that a
limited set of redundantly sampled sites with
uncorrelated and low observational error
(approximate to 0.3 degrees-0.6 degrees C) will
provide the best approach to reconstruction of
large-scale features of the SST field from coral

wintertime sea-level pressure field is more strongly
coupled to surface air temperature fluctuations over
the Eurasian continent than the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO). It resembles the NAO in many
respects; but its primary center of action covers
more of the Arctic, giving it a more zonally
symmetric appearance. Coupled to strong fluctuations
at the 50-hPa level on the intraseasonal,
interannual, and interdecadal time scales, this
``Arctic Oscillation\{''\} (AO) can be interpreted as
the surface signature of modulations in the strength
of the polar vortex aloft. It is proposed that the
zonally asymmetric surface air temperature and
mid-tropospheric circulation anomalies observed in
association with the AO may be secondary baroclinic
features induced by the land-sea contrasts. The same
modal structure is mirrored in the pronounced trends
in winter and springtime surface air temperature,
sea-level pressure, and 50-hPa height over the past
30 years: parts of Eurasia have warmed by as much as
several K, sea-level pressure over parts of the
Arctic has fallen by 4 hPa, and the core of the
lower stratospheric polar vortex has cooled by
several K. These trends can be interpreted as the
development of a systematic bias in one of the

   abstract = {The intention of this research was to explore whether dendroclimatological relationships could be used to reconstruct long-term proxy records of Little Ice Age' glacier mass balance changes in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia. Tree-ring width chronologies from the Mt Waddington area were used in concert with historical glacier records to construct models spanning the past 450 years. The approach was to build models that were based on derived relationships between tree-ring growth and glacier mass balance: (1) warmer temperatures in the summer positively influence tree growth but are detrimental to glacier health; (2) colder temperatures during the winter and deeper snowpack have a negative impact on tree growth, whereas they are related to greater accumulation on the glacier during the winter season. Stepwise regression analyses were applied to tree-ring chronologies to predict glacier mass balance at local and regional scales. The models of net annual balance for the region (regional data set) show that periods of positive mass balance occurred in the AD 1750s, 1820s to 1830s and 1970s. Peaks of winter balance correspond closely to these periods, showing a sharp drop in winter mass balance towards the end of the nineteenth century. Wavelet analyses suggest that glacial mass balance regimes in the region respond synchronously to Pacific Ocean circulation systems such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.},

the phase shift between leaf phenology and
photosynthesis seasonality in a semi-arid Pinus
halepensis forest system, not seen in temperate
sites. Leaf-scale measurements of gas exchange,
nitrogen and phenology were used on daily, seasonal
and annual time-scales. Peak photosynthesis was in
late winter, when high soil moisture, mild
temperatures and low leaf vapour pressure deficit
(D-L) allowed high rates associated with high water-
and nitrogen-use efficiencies. Self-sustained new
needle growth through the dry and hot summer
maximized photosynthesis in the following wet
season, without straining carbon storage. Low rates
of water loss were associated with increasing
sensitivity of stomatal conductance (g(s)) to soil
moisture below a relative extractable water (REW) of
0.4, and decreased g(s) sensitivity to D-L below REW
of approx. 0.2. This response was captured by the
modified Ball-Berry (Leuning) model. While most
physiological parameters and responses measured were
typical of temperate pines, the
photosynthesis-phenological phasing contributed to
high productivity under warm-dry conditions. This
contrasts with reported effects of short-term
periodical droughts and could lead to different
predictions of the effect of warming and drying

Satellite and in situ observations have shown an increase in fire occurrence during drought years and tree mortality following severe droughts, but to date there has been no assessment of long-term impacts of these droughts across landscapes in Amazonia. Here, we use satellite microwave observations of rainfall and canopy backscatter to show that more than 70 million hectares of forest in western Amazonia experienced a strong water deficit during the dry season of 2005 and a closely corresponding decline in canopy structure and moisture. Remarkably, and despite the gradual recovery in total rainfall in subsequent years, the decrease in canopy backscatter persisted until the next major drought, in 2010. The decline in backscatter is attributed to changes in structure and water content associated with the forest upper canopy. The persistence of low backscatter supports the slow recovery (>4 y) of forest canopy structure after the severe drought in 2005. The result suggests that the occurrence of droughts in Amazonia at 5-10 y frequency may lead to persistent alteration of the forest canopy.},

near similar to7degreesN, similar to12degreesN, and
similar to18degreesN on biennial, interannual, and

reflect as equatorial coupled waves, propagating
slowly eastward in covarying SST, Z18, and ZSW

produce a delayed-negative feedback to the warm SST

modification of the extant DAO model. We construct a

   abstract = {The strong trends in climate change already evident,
the likelihood of further changes occurring, and the
increasing scale of potential climate impacts give
urgency to addressing agricultural adaptation more
coherently. There are many potential adaptation
options available for marginal change of existing
agricultural systems, often variations of existing
climate risk management. We show that implementation
of these options is likely to have substantial
benefits under moderate climate change for some
cropping systems. However, there are limits to their
effectiveness under more severe climate
changes. Hence, more systemic changes in resource
allocation need to be considered, such as targeted
diversification of production systems and
livelihoods. We argue that achieving increased
adaptation action will necessitate integration of
climate change-related issues with other risk
factors, such as climate variability and market
risk, and with other policy domains, such as
sustainable development. Dealing with the many
barriers to effective adaptation will require a
comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a
range of scales and issues, for example, from the
understanding by farmers of change in risk profiles
to the establishment of efficient markets that
facilitate response strategies. Science, too, has to
adapt. Multidisciplinary problems require
multidisciplinary solutions, i.e., a focus on
integrated rather than disciplinary science and a
strengthening of the interface with decision
makers. A crucial component of this approach is the
implementation of adaptation assessment frameworks
that are relevant, robust, and easily operated by
all stakeholders, practitioners, policymakers, and

   abstract = {Climate change poses threats to human health, safety, and survival via weather extremes and climatic impacts on food yields, fresh water, infectious diseases, conflict, and displacement. Paradoxically, these risks to health are neither widely nor fully recognized. Historical experiences of diverse societies experiencing climatic changes, spanning multicentury to single-year duration, provide insights into population health vulnerability--even though most climatic changes were considerably less than those anticipated this century and beyond. Historical experience indicates the following. (i) Long-term climate changes have often destabilized civilizations, typically via food shortages, consequent hunger, disease, and unrest. (ii) Medium-term climatic adversity has frequently caused similar health, social, and sometimes political consequences. (iii) Infectious disease epidemics have often occurred in association with briefer episodes of temperature shifts, food shortages, impoverishment, and social disruption. (iv) Societies have often learnt to cope (despite hardship for some groups) with recurring shorter-term (decadal to multiyear) regional climatic cycles (e.g., El Niño Southern Oscillation)--except when extreme phases occur. (v) The drought-famine-starvation nexus has been the main, recurring, serious threat to health. Warming this century is not only likely to greatly exceed the Holocene's natural multidecadal temperature fluctuations but to occur faster. Along with greater climatic variability, models project an increased geographic range and severity of droughts. Modern societies, although larger, better resourced, and more interconnected than past societies, are less flexible, more infrastructure-dependent, densely populated, and hence are vulnerable. Adverse historical climate-related health experiences underscore the case for abating human-induced climate change.},

the global ocean, and also separately in the
tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, are compared
with an ensemble begun in January 1929 with modeled
atmosphere and land initial conditions and
integrated through the 1930s with climatological
SSTs. The ensemble with climatological SSTs produces
values for the precipitation averaged over 1932-39
that are not statistically different from model
climatology. In contrast, the ensembles with global
SST forcing produce a drought centered in the
central plains and southwestern North America that
is clearly separated from the model
climatology. Both the tropical Pacific and northern
tropical Atlantic SST anomalies produce a
statistically significant model drought in this
region. The modeled drought has a spatial pattern
that is different from the observed drought, which
was instead centered in the central and northern
plains and also impacted the northern Rocky Mountain
states but not northeastern Mexico. The model error
in extending the Dust Bowl drought too far south is
attributed to an incorrect response of the model to
warm subtropical North Atlantic SST anomalies. The
model error in the northern states cannot be
attributed to an incorrect response to tropical SST
anomalies. The model also fails to reproduce the
strong surface air warming across most of the
continent during the 1930s. In contrast, the modeled
patterns of precipitation reduction and surface air
temperature warming during the 1950s drought are
more realistic. Tree-ring records show that the Dust
Bowl pattern of drought has occurred before,
suggesting that while the extensive human-induced
land surface degradation and dust aerosol loading of
the 1930s drought may have played an important role
in generating the observed drought pattern, natural
processes, possibly including land interactions, are
capable of generating droughts centered to the north
of the main ENSO teleconnection region. Despite this
caveat, advance knowledge of tropical SSTs alone
would have allowed a high-confidence prediction of a
multiyear and severe drought, but one centered too
far south and without strong cross-continental

Relationships between the seasonal stable isotope data and Greenland and Icelandic temperatures as well as atmospheric flow are investigated for the past 150--200 years. The winter season stable isotope data are found to be influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and very closely related to \{SW\} Greenland temperatures. The linear correlation between the first principal component of the winter season stable isotope data and Greenland winter temperatures is 0.71 for seasonally resolved data and 0.83 for decadally filtered data. The summer season stable isotope data display higher correlations with Stykkisholmur summer temperatures and North Atlantic \{SST\} conditions than with \{SW\} Greenland temperatures. The linear correlation between Stykkisholmur summer temperatures and the first principal component of the summer season stable isotope data is 0.56, increasing to 0.66 for decadally filtered data. Winter season stable isotope data from ice core records that reach more than 1400 years back in time suggest that the warm period that began in the 1920s raised southern Greenland temperatures to the same level as those that prevailed during the warmest intervals of the Medieval Warm Period some 900--1300 years ago. This observation is supported by a southern Greenland ice core borehole temperature inversion. As Greenland borehole temperature inversions are found to correspond better with winter stable isotope data than with summer or annual average stable isotope data it is suggested that a strong local Greenland temperature signal can be extracted from the winter stable isotope data even on centennial to millennial time scales. },

proportional to f(-2) where f is the frequency; and
(3) below time scales of 2 ka the power spectrum is

continental stations become proportional to f(-3/2)
while maritime stations continue to have power
spectra proportional to f(-1/2) down to time scales
of 1 day. To explain these observations, we model
the vertical transport of heat in the atmosphere as
a stochastic diffusion process. The power spectrum
of temperature fluctuations at the earth's surface
expected from this model equation in a two-layer
geometry with thermal and eddy diffusion properties
appropriate to the atmosphere and the ocean and a
radiation condition at the top of the atmosphere
agrees with the observed spectrum. The difference in
power spectra between continental and marine

consequence of the air mass above a maritime station
exchanging heat with both the atmosphere above and
the ocean below while a continental station
exchanges heat mostly with the atmosphere above. (C)

   abstract = {Abstract A multi-millenial simulation with a coupled
atmospheric-oceanic climatic model has been used to
investigate the occurrence rate and characteristics
of multi-year dry and pluvial episodes. Such
episodes are defined as having the same sign
rainfall anomalies for the whole of their
durations. Episodes of 5-, 8- and 10-year durations
are shown to occur all over the globe. The
occurrence rates are approximately in agreement with
probabilistic expectations, although there are
spatial variations associated with El Nino Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) influences. The impacts of the
dry and pluvial episodes are considerable, with
10-year duration dry episodes resulting in a loss of
at least one year's rainfall over the oceans and
much larger losses over arid regions. Similar but
positive outcomes are associated with pluvial
episodes. Accumulated rainfall anomalies over
various multi-decadal periods indicate that regions
with persistent features can occur, implying longer
term impacts than might have been expected from a
succession of dry and pluvial episodes. Time series
of these episodes for individual model gridboxes
highlight a disparity between the occurrence rates
of dry and pluvial episodes and the lack of
synchronicity of these episodes at the various
gridboxes. These time series also clearly illustrate
the rapid fall-off in the occurrence rates of the
episodes as their durations are increased. Despite
claims in the literature that `megadroughts' are
typically associated with extended ENSO events, it
is shown that for a very extended La Nina event the
rainfall anomalies in a number of ENSO-sensitive
regions experienced interannual variability rather
than a persistent anomaly. The role of a number of
large-scale oscillations in generating rainfall
anomalies is examined, but it is concluded that
stochastic processes are needed to account for the
extended duration of dry and pluvial episodes, in
addition to any forcing associated with such
oscillations. This adds a random aspect to the
determination of whether any given, say, ENSO event
will become a dry or pluvial episode.},

represent extreme events of naturally occurring
multidecadal precipitation variations linked to the
dominant pattern of multidecadal SST variability in
the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Gaining insight into
the occurrence of megadroughts thus requires an
understanding of the mechanism that is producing
this multidecadal SST variability. Analysis of the
model variability shows that the mechanism involves
atmosphere-ocean and tropical-midlatitude
interactions, with a crucial element being
wind-forced ocean Rossby waves near 20 degrees N and
25 degrees S in the Pacific whose transit times set
the decadal time scale. At the western boundary, the
Rossby waves reflect into the equatorial Pacific to
affect thermocline depth. The resulting
feedbacks. involving surface temperature. winds, and
the strength of the subtropical cells, produce SST
anomalies and associated precipitation and
convective heating anomalies. These anomalies are
associated with atmospheric Rossby waves and
resulting anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns
in the midlatitude North and South
Pacific. Consequent surface wind stress anomalies
extend equatorward into the Tropics and help force
ocean Rossby waves near 20 degrees N and 25 degrees
S. and so on. Though there are some common elements
with various ENSO processes, this decadal mechanism
is physically distinct mainly because the surface
wind stress anomalies near 20 degrees N and 25
degrees S supplement the wave reflections at the
eastern boundary to force the ocean Rossby waves
that provide the decadal time scale. These wind
anomalies are closely tied to the anomalous
midlatitude atmospheric circulation that is a
product of teleconnections from the multidecadal SST
and tropical convective heating
anomalies. themselves linked to precipitation
anomalies in the southwestern United States and

results in a substantial improvement in the spectral

We present evidence that recent trends in the SH tropospheric circulation can be interpreted as a bias toward the high-index polarity of this pattern, with stronger westerly flow encircling the polar cap. It is argued that the largest and most significant tropospheric trends can be traced to recent trends in the lower stratospheric polar vortex, which are due largely to photochemical ozone losses. During the summer-fall season, the trend toward stronger circumpolar flow has contributed substantially to the observed warming over the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia and to the cooling over eastern Antarctica and the Antarctic plateau.},

secular trend and variability related to the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are the dominant
modes of variance shared among the global
datasets. For the SST data the secular trend
corresponds to a positive trend in Indian Ocean and
South Atlantic SSTs, and a negative trend in North
Pacific and North Atlantic SSTs. The ENSO
reconstruction shows a strong signal in the tropical
Pacific, North Pacific, and Indian Ocean
regions. For the PDSI data, the secular trend
reconstruction shows high amplitudes over central
Africa including the Sahel, whereas the regions with
strong ENSO amplitudes in PDSI are the southwestern

northeastern Brazil, central Africa, the Indian
subcontinent, and Australia. An additional
significant frequency, multidecadal variability, is
identified for the Northern Hemisphere. This
multidecadal frequency appears to be related to the
Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO). The
multidecadal frequency is statistically significant
in the Northern Hemisphere SST data, but is
statistically nonsignificant in the PDSI data.},

oceanographic and atmospheric effects of the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. We
employ two geochemical thermometers measured on
coralline aragonite to reconstruct an independent
proxy-based measure of central equatorial Pacific
sea surface temperature anomaly. In addition, we
assess the observational error associated with
extraction of large-scale SST anomalies from
delta(18)O and Sr/Ca measurements. On the basis of
paired data for the 1981-1987 period, RMS error for
the estimation of SST from Kiritimati coral
delta(18)O is about 0.4 degrees C, assuming no
seawater delta(18)O influence; for Sr/Ca, the
observational error is about 0.5 degrees C. Singular
spectrum analysis of the delta(18)O time series
suggests that 1/3 of the variance is explained by
SST anomaly and that this variance may be separated
from other signals in the frequency domain. The
interannual component of the delta(18)O record
shares 70% variance with the interannual component
of local SST anomaly estimates (rho=-0.84) and
correlates as highly with NINO3 region (150 degrees
W-90 degrees W, 5 degrees N-5 degrees S) SST anomaly
estimates; comparison of annual averages of the
delta(18)O data with analyzed SST for 55 years
suggests that the error in deriving annually
averaged SST anomalies at Kiritimati is about 0.4
degrees C. A global SST correlation analysis
suggests significant correlation with the rest of
the Pacific Basin and the tropical Indian and
Atlantic sectors. The ocean-wide level of
correlation achieved using the coral data is
indistinguishable from that achieved using the NINO3
SST anomaly index and suggests that a few
well-located coral reconstructions with low
observational error may be sufficient to reconstruct
the global SST anomaly field associated with ENSO

a southward shift in the monsoon front. The first of

States have been observed since the mid-twentieth
century. These include a reduction in the amount of
precipitation arriving as snow, a decline in
snowpack at low and midelevations, and a shift
toward earlier arrival of both snowmelt and the
centroid (center of mass) of streamflows. To project
future water supply reliability, it is crucial to
obtain a better understanding of the underlying
cause or causes for these changes. A regional
warming is often posited as the cause of these
changes without formal testing of different
competitive explanations for the warming. In this
study, a rigorous detection and attribution analysis
is performed to determine the causes of the late
winter/early spring changes in hydrologically
relevant temperature variables over mountain ranges
of the western United States. Natural internal
climate variability, as estimated from two long
control climate model simulations, is insufficient
to explain the rapid increase in daily minimum and
maximum temperatures, the sharp decline in frost
days, and the rise in degree-days above 0 degrees C
(a simple proxy for temperature-driven
snowmelt). These observed changes are also
inconsistent with the model-predicted responses to
variability in solar irradiance and volcanic
activity. The observations are consistent with
climate simulations that include the combined
effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and
aerosols. It is found that, for each temperature
variable considered, an anthropogenic signal is
identifiable in observational fields. The results
are robust to uncertainties in model-estimated
fingerprints and natural variability noise, to the
choice of statistical down-scaling method, and to
various processing options in the detection and

during non-ENSO phases (r=-0.65,p<0.01) and ENSO

the SO is part of a natural decadal-timescale

the first hundred years of the pressures at Darwin,
Australia, beginning in 1882. Both the recent trend

agriculture is the primary sustenance for Sahel
populations, and severe droughts (in the 1970s and

societal impacts. The future frequency of Sahel
droughts and the evolution of its hydrological
balance are therefore of great interest. The article
reviews 10 recent research studies that attempt to
discover how climate changes will affect the
hydrology of the Sahel throughout the 21st
century. All 10 studies rely on atmosphere-ocean
global climate model (AOGCM) simulations based on a
range of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Many of
the simulations are contained in the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change archives
for Assessment Reports #3 and #4. Two of the studies
use AOGCM data to drive regional climate
models. Seven studies make projections for the first
half of the 21st century and eight studies make
projections for the second half. Some studies make
projections of wetter conditions and some predict
more frequent droughts, and each describes the
atmospheric processes associated with its
prediction. Only one study projects more frequent
droughts before 2050, and that is only for
continent-wide degradation in vegetation cover. The
challenge to correctly simulate Sahel rainfall
decadal trends is particularly daunting because
multiple physical mechanisms compete to drive the
trend upwards or downwards. A variety of model
deficiencies, regarding the simulation of one or
more of these physical processes, taints models'
climate change projections. Consequently, no
consensus emerges regarding the impact of

Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between 740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago (Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long--28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future.},

high latitudes on the deep, slow, thermohaline
circulation have received enormous attention,
especially the possibility of a shutdown in the
meridional overturning that involves sinking of
surface waters in the northern Atlantic Ocean. A
recent study by Fedorov et al. has drawn attention
to the effects of a freshening on the other main
component of the oceanic circulation-the swift,
shallow, wind-driven circulation that varies on
decadal time scales and is closely associated with
the ventilated thermocline. That circulation too
involves meridional overturning, but its variations
and critical transitions affect mainly the
Tropics. A surface freshening in mid- to high
latitudes can deepen the equatorial thermocline to
such a degree that temperatures along the equator
become as warm in the eastern part of the basin as
they are in the west, the tropical zonal sea surface
temperature gradient virtually disappears, and
permanently warm conditions prevail in the
Tropics. In a model that has both the wind-driven
and thermohaline components of the circulation,
which factors determine the relative effects of a
freshening on the two components and its impact on
climate? Studies with an idealized ocean general
circulation model find that vertical diffusivity is
one of the critical parameters that affect the
relative strength of the two circulation components

spatial structure of the freshening and imposed
meridional temperature gradients are other important
factors.},

hydrological cycles from eight current atmospheric
reanalyses and their depiction of changes over
time. A brief evaluation of the water and energy
cycles in the latest version of the NCAR climate
model referred to as CCSM4 is also given. The focus
is on the mean ocean, land, and global precipitation
P; the corresponding evaporation E; their difference
corresponding to the surface freshwater flux E-P;
and the vertically integrated atmospheric moisture
transports. Using the model based P and E, the
time-and area-average E-P for the oceans, P-E for
land, and the moisture transport from ocean to land
should all be identical but are not close in most
reanalyses, and often differ significantly from
observational estimates of the surface return flow
based on net river discharge into the oceans. Their
differences reveal outstanding issues with
atmospheric models and their biases, which are
manifested as analysis increments in the
reanalyses. The NCAR CCSM4, along with most
reanalysis models, the exception being MERRA, has
too-intense water cycling (P and E) over the ocean
although ocean-to-land transports are very close to
observed. Precipitation from reanalyses that
assimilate moisture from satellite observations
exhibits large changes identified with the changes
in the observing system, as new and improved
temperature and water vapor channels are assimilated
and, while P improves after about 2002, E-P does
not. Discrepancies among hydrological cycle
components arise from analysis increments that can
add or subtract moisture. The large-scale moisture
budget divergences are more stable in time and
similar across reanalyses than model-based estimates
of E-P. Results are consistent with the view that
recycling of moisture is too large in most models
and the lifetime of moisture is too short. For the
energy cycle, most reanalyses have spurious
imbalances of similar to 10 W m(-2) within the
atmosphere, and similar to 5-10 W m(-2) in net
fluxes into the surface and to space. Major
improvements are needed in model treatment and
assimilation of moisture, and surface fluxes from
reanalyses should only be used with great caution.},

   abstract = {A detailed vertically integrated atmospheric heat
and energy budget is presented along with estimated
heat budgets at the surface and top-of-atmosphere
for the subtropics. It is shown that the total
energy transports are remarkably seamless in spite
of greatly varying mechanisms. From the Tropics to
about 318 latitude, the primary transport mechanisms
are the Hadley and Walker overturning
circulations. In the extratropics the energy
transports are carried out by baroclinic eddies
broadly organized into storm tracks and
quasi-stationary waves that covary in a symbiotic
way as the location and activity in storm tracks are
determined by, and in turn help maintain through
eddy transports, the quasi-stationary flow. In the
upward branch of the Hadley cell, the predominant
diabatic process is latent heating that results from
convergence of moisture by the circulation
itself. Hence large poleward transports of dry
static energy are compensated by equatorward
transports of latent energy, resulting in a modest
poleward transport of moist static energy. The
subsidence warming in the downward branch is
compensated by cooling in the subtropics that mainly
arises from energy transport to higher latitudes by
transient baroclinic eddies that are stronger in the
winter hemisphere. Effectively, the outgoing
longwave radiation to space is distributed over
middle and high latitudes and is not limited to the
clear dry regions in the subtropics. Further, some
of the radiative cooling in the subtropics is a
consequence of the circulation. Hence the cooling by
transient eddies in the subtropics is a fundamental
driver of the observed Hadley circulation and
realizes the seamless transport from Tropics to
extratropics, while tropical sea surface
temperatures over the oceans determine where the
upward branch is located. The relatively clear skies
in the subtropics further provide for ample
absorption of solar radiation at the surface where
it feeds strong evaporation, which exceeds
precipitation, and supplies the equatorward flow of
latent energy into the upward branch of the Hadley
circulation as well as the poleward transports into
midlatitude storm tracks. The evaporation is
sufficiently strong that it is also compensated by a
subsurface ocean heat transport that in turn is
driven by the Hadley circulation surface winds.},

reveals that the two major U. S. droughts of the
20th Century had distinct causes. Drought severity
over the Southern Plains during 1946-1956 is very
likely attributable to remote influences of global
sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The Southern Plains
and adjacent Southwest are regions particularly
sensitive to SST variability, and strong La Nina
events that occurred during 1946-1956 exposed that
region's drought vulnerability. Drought severity
over the Northern Plains during 1932-1939 was likely
triggered instead by random atmospheric
variability. The Northern Plains lies within a
region of comparatively low sensitivity to SST
variability, and that region's drought exhibited
little sensitivity to SST conditions during the Dust
Bowl period. Our results indicate that the southern
portions of the Great Plains lie within an epicenter

between explosive volcanic eruptions and subsequent
El Nino climate events(1,2). This connection,
however, has remained controversial(3-5). Here we
present support for a response of the El
Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon(6,7) to
forcing from explosive volcanism by using two
different palaeoclimate reconstructions of El Nino
activity(8,9) and two independent, proxy-based
chronologies of explosive volcanic activity(5) from
AD 1649 to the present. We demonstrate a
significant, multi-year, El Nino-like response to
explosive tropical volcanic forcing over the past
several centuries. The results imply roughly a
doubling of the probability of an El Nino event
occurring in the winter following a volcanic
eruption. Our empirical findings shed light on how
the tropical Pacific ocean-atmosphere system may
respond to exogenous (both natural and
anthropogenic) radiative forcing.},

likely extend fire seasons throughout the western

later than is currently typical, and will increase
the total area burned in some regions. If climatic
change increases the amplitude and duration of
extreme fire weather we can expect significant
changes in the distribution and abundance of

the large heat capacity of the extra-tropical

variance towards longer timescales. Atmospheric
teleconnections spread the extratropical signal to
the tropical regions. Once SST anomalies have
developed in the Tropics, global atmospheric

suggests that hyper climate modes can vary on

simulate the response of the El Ni (n) over
tildeo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system to solar
and orbital forcing over the Holocene. Solar forcing
is reconstructed from radiocarbon production rate
data, using various scaling factors to account for
the conflicting estimates of solar irradiance
variability. As estimates of the difference since
the Maunder Minimum range from 0.05% to 0.5% of the
solar "constant,'' we consider these two extreme
scenarios, along with the intermediate case of
0.2%. We show that for large or moderate forcings,
the low-pass-filtered east-west sea surface
temperature gradient along the equator responds
almost linearly to irradiance forcing, with a short
phase lag (about a decade). Wavelet analysis shows a
statistically significant enhancement of the
century-to-millennial-scale ENSO variability for
even a moderate irradiance forcing. In contrast, the
0.05% case displays no such enhancement. Orbitally
driven insolation forcing is found to produce a
long-term increase of ENSO variability from the
early Holocene onward, in accordance with previous
findings. When both forcings are combined, the
superposition is approximately linear in the strong
scaling case. Overall, the sea surface temperature
response is of the magnitude required, and is
persistent enough, to induce important climatic
perturbations worldwide. The results suggest that
ENSO may plausibly have acted as a mediator between

April-June (AMJ) seasonal-mean anomaly was not
representative of the variability of 10-day low-pass
anomalies. Rather, over North America large
fluctuations on monthly and shorter timescales
occurred, with the dominant streamfunction anomalies
not strongly anticyclonic until June. In fact, the
AMJ anomaly was dominated by two episodes of rapidly
developing, intense anomalous anticyclones in early
and late June. Examination of the daily 10-day
low-pass streamfunction anomalies at 300 mb suggests
that propagating Rossby waves originating in the
west Pacific played a dominant role in the
initiation of these intense anomalous
anticyclones. Numerical experiments with a linear,
time-dependent, barotropic model also support this
hypothesis. These results suggest that the AMJ
anomaly, which has been characterized as a wave
train seemingly forced in the east Pacific, may not

Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) for
1958 to 2001, adjusted for bias over the southern
oceans prior to 1.979, an analysis is made of global
patterns of monthly mean anomalies of atmospheric
mass, which is approximately conserved globally. It
differs from previous analyses of atmospheric
circulation by effectively area weighting surface or
sea level pressure that diminishes the role of high
latitudes. To examine whether global patterns of
behavior exist requires analysis of all seasons
together (as opposite seasons occur in each
hemisphere). Empirical orthogonal function (EOF)
analysis, R-mode varimax-rotated EOF analysis, and
cyclostationary EOF (CSEOF) analysis tools are used
to explore patterns and variability on interannual
and longer time scales. Clarification is given of
varimax terminology and procedures that have been
previously misinterpreted. The dominant global
monthly variability overall is associated with the
Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM), which is
active in all months of the year. However, it is not
very coherent from month to month and exhibits a
great deal of natural unforced variability. The
third most important pattern is the Northern
Hemisphere annular mode (NAM) and associated North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which is the equivalent
Northern Hemisphere expression. Neither of these is
really a global mode, although they covary on long
time scales in association with tropical or external
forcing. For monthly data, the second mode is
coherent with Nino-3.4 sea surface temperatures and
thus corresponds to El Nino-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO), which is truly global in extent. It exhibits
more coherent evolution with time and projects
strongest onto the interannual variability, where it
stands out by far as the dominant mode in the CSEOF
analysis. The CSEOF analysis extracts the patterns
phase locked with annual cycle and reveals their
evolution throughout the year. Standard EOF and
varimax analyses are not able to evolve with time of
year unless the analysis is stratified by
season. Varimax analysis is able to extract the SAM,
NAM, and ENSO modes very well, however.},

   abstract = {This paper deals primarily with the 1988 summer
drought over much of the contiguous United States
and its generation from conditions during the
preceding spring. Both the spring and summer
environment are described in terms of hemispheric
flow patterns in midtroposphere, temperature and
precipitation anomalies, and sea surface temperature
anomalies. Conditions in March were especially
indicative of the ensuing drought, since a model
routinely employed in long-range forecasting showed
that the March circulation would most likely be
followed by a hot dry April, May, and June over much
of the nation-a pattern which persisted into early
summer. This result suggests that the initiation of
the drought was rooted in extratropical climate
variations, an alternative hypothesis to one which
attributes the persistent drought-producing
circulation to oceanic and atmospheric conditions in
the tropics. In many respects the summer drought of
1988 was similar to earlier great droughts of the
Great Plains, although it was spatially more
extensive. Attempts by three forecast groups to
predict the summer conditions from spring's were
moderately successful, though none of these
anticipated the drought's severity and extent. The
underlying reasons for the summer forecast made by
the author are verified using objective tools.
Premonitory signs showed up in antecedent seasons
when deficient precipitation occurred, when
climatological contingencies provided alerts, and
when extratropical sea surface temperature patterns
evolved in a conducive manner. A new modified
barotropic model iterating from the May
midtropospheric height pattern using a mean summer
estimate of seasonal forcing produces a reasonably
successful estimate of the summer circulation and,
in retrospect, even more so when initialized from
the March height pattern for the April, May, and
June period of inception.},

severe droughts. A distinct asymmetry is found in
the impacts of the opposite phases of both ENSO and
IOD on Australian rainfall and soil moisture. There
are significant differences between the dominant
drivers of drought at interannual and decadal time
scales. On interannual time scales, both ENSO and
the IOD modify southeastern Australian soil
moisture, with the driest (wettest) conditions over
the southeast and more broadly over large parts of
Australia occurring during years when an El Nino and
a positive IOD event (La Nina and a negative IOD
event) co-occur. The atmospheric circulation
associated with these responses is
discussed. Lower-frequency variability over
southeastern Australia, however, including multiyear
drought periods, seems to be more robustly related
to Indian Ocean temperatures than Pacific
conditions. The frequencies of both positive and
negative IOD events are significantly different
during periods of prolonged drought compared to
extended periods of "normal" rainfall. In contrast,
the frequency of ENSO events remains largely
unchanged during prolonged dry and wet periods. For
the Murray Darling Basin, there appears to be a
significant influence by La Nina and both positive

plays a much more prominent role than for more
southern regions, especially on interannual time

prolonged dry (wet) periods, positive IOD events

March precipitation 1942 - 1983. We validated the

   abstract = {This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge
of the climate of southwest USA (the 'Southwest'),
Low annual precipitation, clear skies, and
year-round warm climate over much of the Southwest
are due in large part to a quasi-permanent
subtropical high-pressure ridge over the
region. However, the Southwest is located between
the mid-latitude and subtropical atmospheric
circulation regimes, and this positioning relative
to shifts in these regimes is the fundamental reason
for the region's climatic variability. Furthermore,
the Southwest's complex topography and its
geographical proximity to the Pacific Ocean, the
Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico also
contribute to this region's high climatic
variability, El Nino, which is an increase in
sea-surface temperature of the eastern equatorial
Pacific Ocean with an associated shift of the active
center of atmospheric convection from the western to
the central equatorial Pacific, has a well-developed
teleconnection with the Southwest, usually resulting
in wet winters. La Nina, the opposite oceanic case
of El Nino usually results in dry winters for the
Southwest. Another important oceanic influence on
winter climate of the Southwest is a feature called
the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which has
been defined as temporal variation in sea-surface
temperatures for most of the Northern Pacific Ocean,
The effects of ENSO and PDO can amplify each other,
resulting in increased annual variability in
precipitation over the Southwest. The major feature
that sets the climate of the Southwest apart from
the rest of the United States is the North American
monsoon, which in the US is most noticeable in
Arizona and New Mexico, Up to 50% of the annual
rainfall of Arizona and New Mexico occurs as
monsoonal storms from July through
September. Instrumental measurement of temperature
and precipitation in the Southwest dates back to the
middle to late 1800s, From that record, average
annual rainfall of Arizona is 322 mm (12.7"), while
that of New Mexico is 340 nun (13.4"), and mean
annual temperature of New Mexico is cooler
(12degreesC [53degreesF]) than Arizona (17degreesC
[62degreesF]). As instrumental meteorological
records extend back only about 100 to 120 yr
throughout the Southwest, they are of limited
utility for studying climate phenomena of long time
frames. Hence, there is a need to extend the
measured meteorological record further back in time
using so-called 'natural archive' pal eo climate
records. Tree-ring data, which provide annual
resolution, range throughout the Southwest, extend
back in time for up to 1000 yr or more in various
forests of the Southwest, and integrate well the
influences of both temperature and precipitation,
are useful for this assessment of climate of the
Southwest. Tree growth of mid-elevation forests
typically responds to moisture availability during
the growing season, and a commonly used climate
variable in paleo-precipitation studies is the
Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which is a
single variable derived from variation in
precipitation and temperature. June-August PDSI
strongly represents precipitation and, to a lesser
extent, temperature of the year prior to the growing
season (prior September through current August), The
maximum intra-ring density of higher elevation trees
can yield a useful record of summer temperature
variation. The combined paleo-modern climate record
has at least 3 occurrences of multi-decadal
variation (50 to 80 yr) of alternating dry (below
average PDSI) to wet (above average PDSI). The

   abstract = {Anew dataset of historical monthly streamflow at the
farthest downstream stations for the world's 925
largest ocean-reaching rivers has been created for
community use. Available new gauge records are added
to a network of gauges that covers similar to 80 x
10(6) km(2) or similar to 80% of global
ocean-draining land areas and accounts for about
73% of global total runoff. For most of the large
rivers, the record for 1948-2004 is fairly
complete. Data gaps in the records are filled
through linear regression using streamflow simulated
by a land surface model [ Community Land Model,
version 3 (CLM3)] forced with observed precipitation
and other atmospheric forcings that are
significantly ( and often strongly) correlated with
the observed streamflow for most rivers. Compared
with previous studies, the new dataset has improved
homogeneity and enables more reliable assessments of
decadal and long-term changes in continental
freshwater discharge into the oceans. The
model-simulated runoff ratio over drainage areas
with and without gauge records is used to estimate
the contribution from the areas not monitored by the
gauges in deriving the total discharge into the
global oceans. Results reveal large variations in
yearly streamflow for most of the world's large
rivers and for continental discharge, but only about
one-third of the top 200 rivers ( including the
Congo, Mississippi, Yenisey, Parana, Ganges,
Columbia, Uruguay, and Niger) show statistically
significant trends during 1948-2004, with the rivers
having downward trends ( 45) outnumbering those with
upward trends ( 19). The interannual variations are
correlated with the El Nino-SouthernnOscillation
(ENSO) events for discharge into the Atlantic,
Pacific, Indian, and global ocean as a whole. For
ocean basins other than the Arctic, and for the
global ocean as a whole, the discharge data show
small or downward trends, which are statistically
significant for the Pacific (-9.4 km(3)
yr(-1)). Precipitation is a major driver for the
discharge trends and large interannual-to-decadal
variations. Comparisons with the CLM3 simulation
suggest that direct human influence on annual
streamflow is likely small compared with climatic
forcing during 1948-2004 for most of the world's
major rivers. For the Arctic drainage areas, upward
trends in streamflow are not accompanied by
increasing precipitation, especially over Siberia,
based on available data, although recent surface
warming and associated downward trends in snow cover
and soil ice content over the northern high
latitudes contribute to increased runoff in these
regions. The results are qualitatively consistent
with climate model projections but contradict an
earlier report of increasing continental runoff
during the recent decades based on limited records.},

global datasets on column-integrated water vapor
(precipitable water). For years before 1996, the
Ross and Elliott radiosonde dataset is used for
validation of European Centre for Medium-range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalyses ERA-40. Only
the special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) dataset
from remote sensing systems (RSS) has credible
means, variability and trends for the oceans, but it
is available only for the post-1988 period. Major
problems are found in the means, variability and
trends from 1988 to 2001 for both reanalyses from
National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)
and the ERA-40 reanalysis over the oceans, and for
the NASA water vapor project (NVAP) dataset more
generally. NCEP and ERA-40 values are reasonable
over land where constrained by
radiosondes. Accordingly, users of these data should
take great care in accepting results as real. The
problems highlight the need for reprocessing of
data, as has been done by RSS, and reanalyses that
adequately take account of the changing observing
system. Precipitable water variability for 1988-2001
is dominated by the evolution of ENSO and especially
the structures that occurred during and following
the 1997-98 El Nino event. The evidence from SSM/I
for the global ocean suggests that recent trends in
precipitable water are generally positive and, for
1988 through 2003, average 0.40 +/- 0.09 mm per
decade or 1.3 +/- 0.3% per decade for the ocean as
a whole, where the error bars are 95% confidence
intervals. Over the oceans, the precipitable water
variability relates very strongly to changes in
SSTs, both in terms of spatial structure of trends
and temporal variability (with regression
coefficient for 30 degrees N-30 degrees S of 7.8%
K-1) and is consistent with the assumption of fairly
constant relative humidity. In the tropics, the
trends are also influenced by changes in rainfall
which, in turn, are closely associated with the mean
flow and convergence of moisture by the trade
winds. The main region where positive trends are not
very evident is over Europe, in spite of large and
positive trends over the North Atlantic since
1988. A much longer time series is probably required
to obtain stable patterns of trends over the oceans,
although the main variability could probably be
deduced from past SST and associated precipitation
variations.},

@article{oglesby12,
   abstract = {During medieval times (900-1300 AD; henceforth MT),
persistent drought ('megadrought') was a ubiquitous
feature for much of North America. To better
understand the mechanisms for these droughts,
relationships between specific sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) and drought in North America
have been synthesized from previous studies using
modern observations, proxy paleo-data, and
simulations from multiple climate models. Particular
focus is on the role of the Atlantic Multidecadal
Oscillation (AMO), a roughly 60-80 year fluctuation
in the North Atlantic between relatively warm ('warm
phase') and cool ('cold phase') SSTs. Present-day
relationships, for which instrumental observations
can be used, indicate that persistent droughts in
the U.S. Great Plains and Southwest are closely
related to AMO. During AMO warm (cold) phases, most
of North America is dry (wet). The MT drought is
closely related to AMO-like warm phases in the North
Atlantic. However, the MT drought is just one of
numerous droughts on centennial timescales affected
by the AMO that new results from the proxy record
indicate impacted North America during the
Holocene. The influence of North Atlantic SST on
modern North American drought is examined using
simulations made by global climate models. When
forced by warm North Atlantic SST anomalies, all
models captured significant drying over North
America, despite some regional differences. Overall,
the ensemble of the 5 models could well reproduce
the statistical relationship between the dry/wet
fluctuations in the North America and North Atlantic
SST anomalies. Using one particular climate model,
we further demonstrated that warm North Atlantic SST
anomalies might have played a major role in the MT
drought over much of North America. The MT drought
could be simulated either by perpetual La Nina-like
conditions in the eastern Pacific or warm phase of
the AMO in the North Atlantic. Best match to proxy
reconstructions was obtained, however, when both La
Nina and warm phase AMO conditions were
imposed. During the warm phase of AMO, the
subtropical high is displaced north and east of its
mean location, reducing moisture transport into the
US except along the mid-Atlantic coast. During the
cool phase, the subtropical high strengthens and
pushes westward, allowing for more moisture
transport into the central and western US. In
summary, the AMO modulates the large-scale
circulation to be more (less) conducive to
precipitation over the central and western
U.S. during cold (warm) phases. Its effects must be
considered along with other, shorter time-scale
factors such as ENSO, or PDO, as well as local
effects that affect land surface-atmosphere
interactions, such as soil moisture. (C) 2011

signals in time series with a characteristic 'red'
noise background which arises from temporal
persistence. This background is estimated by a
'robust' procedure that, unlike conventional
techniques, is largely unbiased by the presence of
signals immersed in the noise. Making use of
multiple-taper spectral analysis methods, the
technique further provides for a distinction between
purely harmonic (periodic) signals, and broader-band
('quasiperiodic') signals. The effectiveness of our
signal detection procedure is demonstrated with
synthetic examples that simulate a variety of
possible periodic and quasiperiodic signals immersed
in red noise. We apply our methodology to historical
climate and paleoclimate time series
examples. Analysis of a approximate to 3 million
year sediment core reveals significant periodic
components at known astronomical forcing
periodicities and a significant quasiperiodic 100
year peak. Analysis of a roughly 1500 year tree-ring
reconstruction of Scandinavian summer temperatures
suggests significant quasiperiodic signals on a
near-century timescale, an interdecadal 16-18 year
timescale, within the interannual El Ninio/Southem

timescale. Analysis of the 144 year record of Great
Salt Lake monthly volume change reveals a
significant broad band of significant interdecadal
variability, ENSO-timescale peaks, an annual cycle
and its harmonics. Focusing in detail on the
historical estimated global-average surface
temperature record, we find a highly significant
secular trend relative to the estimated red noise

   abstract = {Progress toward understanding the causes of and
physical mechanisms involved in the 1988 North
American drought is reported. An earlier study
demonstrated that major sea surface temperature
(SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean, in
association with the 1988 La Nina, may have
disrupted atmospheric heating patterns by changing
the location and intensity of the intertropical
convergence zone and that such heating anomalies
could have initiated the circulation anomalies
across North America responsible for the drought. A
key issue of when the drought circulation anomalies
developed and their relation to changes in tropical
Pacific SSTs is examined. Although unusually dry
soil moisture and heat waves persisted into August,
the anomalous atmospheric conditions that brought on
the drought occurred in April, May, and June of
1988. The evolution of the Pacific SSTs and tropical
convection, as revealed by outgoing longwave
radiation, is shown to be consistent with the
development of the conditions favorable for
initiating the drought circulation pattern in April
through June of 1988. On the equator at
110-degrees-W, SST anomalies exceeded
-2.75-degrees-C in only April, May, and June and
were largest (-4.1-degrees-C) in May 1988. The
issues of how the 1988 La Nina differed from those
in the past and the importance of the whole SST
field in determining the anomalous diabatic heating
are also discussed. Diagnostic calculations of
atmospheric diabatic heating confirm that
atmospheric heating anomalies existed in the
tropical Pacific in association with the major SST
anomalies during this time. The link between the
anomalous heating and the tropical SSTs supports the
view that influences external to the atmosphere were
important and that the drought was not generated
solely by mechanisms internal to the atmosphere. The
distribution of diagnosed heating anomalies over
North America, together with a planetary wave model
response to idealized forcing, is described to
clarify the possible role of soil moisture anomalies
in perpetuating the drought. It is argued that
feedback-caused soil moisture anomalies may have
been secondary sources for the drought circulation
but could not have been the primary instigator. For
the most part, other diagnosed heating anomalies
during the drought are found to have little
influence on the North American region. Criteria to
help judge the ability of general circulation models
to simulate the drought are discussed.},

Our results extend previous conclusions that recent Northern Hemisphere surface temperature increases are likely anomalous in a long-term context.

If tree-ring data are used, the conclusion can be extended to at least the past 1,700 years, but with additional strong caveats.

   abstract = {During the early Pliocene, 5 to 3 million years ago,
globally averaged temperatures were substantially
higher than they are today, even though the external
factors that determine climate were essentially the
same. In the tropics, El Nino was continual (or
"permanent'') rather than intermittent. The
appearance of northern continental glaciers, and of
cold surface waters in oceanic upwelling zones in
low latitudes (both coastal and equatorial),
signaled the termination of those warm climate
conditions and the end of permanent El Nino. This
led to the amplification of obliquity (but not
precession) cycles in equatorial sea surface
temperatures and in global ice volume, with the
former leading the latter by several thousand
years. A possible explanation is that the gradual
shoaling of the oceanic thermocline reached a
threshold around 3 million years ago, when the winds
started bringing cold waters to the surface in low
latitudes. This introduced feedbacks involving
ocean-atmosphere interactions that, along with
ice-albedo feedbacks, amplified obliquity cycles. A
future melting of glaciers, changes in the
hydrological cycle, and a deepening of the
thermocline could restore the warm conditions of the
early Pliocene.},

to an intensification of the easterly trade winds

to be distinct from climate variations centered in
the North Pacific, such as the Pacific decadal
oscillation. In the eastern Pacific, tide gauge
records exhibit higher-amplitude decadal
fluctuations than in the western tropical Pacific,
and the recent negative sea level trends are
indistinguishable from these fluctuations. The
shifts in trade wind strength and western Pacific

recent climate has been debated for many decades and
recent papers suggest that solar forcing may be less
than previously believed. Because solar variability
before the satellite period must be scaled from
proxy data, large uncertainty exists about phase and
magnitude of the forcing. We used a coupled climate
system model to determine whether proxy-based
irradiance series are capable of inducing climatic
variations that resemble variations found in climate
reconstructions, and if part of the previously
estimated large range of past solar irradiance
changes could be excluded. Transient simulations,
covering the published range of solar irradiance
estimates, were integrated from 850 AD to the
present. Solar forcing as well as volcanic and
anthropogenic forcing are detectable in the model
results despite internal variability. The resulting
climates are generally consistent with temperature
reconstructions. Smaller, rather than larger,
long-term trends in solar irradiance appear more
plausible and produced modeled climates in better
agreement with the range of Northern Hemisphere
temperature proxy records both with respect to phase
and magnitude. Despite the direct response of the
model to solar forcing, even large solar irradiance
change combined with realistic volcanic forcing over
past centuries could not explain the late 20th
century warming without inclusion of greenhouse gas
forcing. Although solar and volcanic effects appear
to dominate most of the slow climate variations
within the past thousand years, the impacts of
greenhouse gases have dominated since the second
half of the last century.},

   abstract = {Singular systems (or singular spectrum) analysis
(SSA) was originally proposed for noise reduction in
the analysis of experimental data and is now
becoming widely used to identify intermittent or
modulated oscillations in geophysical and climatic
time series. Progress has been hindered by a lack of
effective statistical tests to discriminate between
potential oscillations and anything but the simplest
form of noise, that is, ''white'' (independent,
identically distributed) noise, in which power is
independent of frequency. The authors show how the
basic formalism of SSA provides a natural test for
modulated oscillations against an arbitrary
''colored noise'' null hypothesis. This test, Monte
Carlo SSA, is illustrated using synthetic data in
three situations: (i) where there is prior knowledge
of the power-spectral characteristics of the noise,
a situation expected in some laboratory and
engineering applications, or when the ''noise''
against which the data is being tested consists of
the output of an independently specified model, such
as a climate model; (ii) where a simple hypothetical
noise model is tested, namely, that the data
consists only of white or colored noise; and (iii)
where a composite. hypothetical noise model is
tested, assuming some deterministic components have
already been found in the data, such as a trend or
annual cycle, and it needs to be established whether
the remainder may be attributed to noise. The
authors examine two historical temperature records
and show that the strength of the evidence provided
by SSA for interannual and interdecadal climate
oscillations in such data has been considerably
overestimated. In contrast, multiple inter- and
subannual oscillatory components are identified in
an extended Southern Oscillation index at a high
significance level. The authors explore a number of
variations on the Monte Carlo SSA algorithm and note
that it is readily applicable to multivariate
series, covering standard empirical orthogonal

reconstruction and test it against an existing set
of dendroclimatic reconstructions of summer drought
patterns over the conterminous US back to AD
1700. The new reconstructions are based on a set of
483 drought-sensitive tree-ring chronologies
available across the continental US. In contrast
with the 'point-by-point' (PPR) local regression
technique used previously, the tree-ring data were
calibrated against the instrumental record of summer
drought (June-August Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI)) based on application of the 'Regularized
Expectation Maximization' ('RegEM') algorithm to
relate large-scale patterns of variation in proxy
and instrumental data over a common (twentieth
century) interval. A screening procedure was first
used to select an optimal subset of candidate
tree-ring drought predictors, and the predictors
(tree-ring data) and predictand (instrumental PDSI)
were prewhitened prior to calibration, with serial
correlation added back into the reconstruction at
the end of the procedure. The PDSI field was
separated into eight relatively homogenous regions
of summer drought through a cluster analysis, and
three distinct calibration schemes were
investigated: (i) 'global' (i.e., entire
conterminous US domain) proxy data calibrated
against 'global' PDSI; (ii) regional proxy data
calibrated against regional PDSI; and (iii) global
proxy data calibrated against regional PDSI. The
greatest cross-validated skill was evident for case
(iii), suggesting the existence of useful non-local
information in the tree-ring predictor
set. Cross-validation results based on withheld late
nineteenth/early twentieth-century instrumental
data, as well as a regionally limited extension of
cross-validation results back to the mid-nineteenth
century based on long available instrumental series,
indicate a modest improvement in reconstructive
skill over the PPR approach. At the continental
scale, the 1930s 'Dust Bowl' remains the most severe

estimated uncertainties, but more severe episodes
may have occurred at regional scales in past

   abstract = {Western United States forest wildfire activity is widely thought to have increased in recent decades, yet neither the extent of recent changes nor the degree to which climate may be driving regional changes in wildfire has been systematically documented. Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th- and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.},

rainfall variability and hence terrestrial
productivity in the densely populated tropical
Indo-Pacific region. It has been proposed that the
main control of summer monsoon precipitation on
millennial timescales is local insolation(1-3), but
unravelling the mechanisms that have influenced
monsoon variability and teleconnections has proven
difficult, owing to the lack of high-resolution
records of past monsoon behaviour. Here we present a
precisely dated reconstruction of monsoon rainfall
over the past 12,000 years, based on oxygen isotope
measurements from two stalagmites collected in
southeast Indonesia. We show that the summer monsoon
precipitation increased during the Younger Dryas
cooling event, when Atlantic meridional overturning
circulation was relatively weak(4). Monsoon
precipitation intensified even more rapidly from
11,000 to 7,000 years ago, when the Indonesian
continental shelf was flooded by global sea-level
rise(5-7). We suggest that the intensification
during the Younger Dryas cooling was caused by
enhanced winter monsoon outflow from Asia and a
related southward migration of the intertropical
convergence zone(8). However, the early Holocene
intensification of monsoon precipitation was driven
by sea-level rise, which increased the supply of
moisture to the Indonesian archipelago.},

Given that further human-forced changes in the Earth's climate system seem inevitable, the possibility exists that the character of ENSO and its impacts might change over the coming century. Although this issue has been investigated many times during the past 20 years, there is very little consensus on future changes in ENSO, apart from an expectation that ENSO will continue to be a dominant source of year-to-year variability. Here we show that there are in fact robust projected changes in the spatial patterns of year-to-year ENSO-driven variability in both surface temperature and precipitation. These changes are evident in the two most recent generations of climate models, using four different scenarios for CO2 and other radiatively active gases. By the mid- to late twenty-first century, the projections include an intensification of both El-Niño-driven drying in the western Pacific Ocean and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. Experiments with an Atmospheric General Circulation Model reveal that robust projected changes in precipitation anomalies during El Niño years are primarily determined by a nonlinear response to surface global warming. Uncertain projected changes in the amplitude of ENSO-driven surface temperature variability have only a secondary role. Projected changes in key characteristics of ENSO are consequently much clearer than previously realized.},

cycle is discussed. Particular attention is given to
the Bjerknes feedback, the instability mechanism
which figures prominently in ENSO past and
future. Our knowledge of ENSO in the paleoclimate
record has expanded rapidly within the last 5
yr. The ENSO cycle is present in all relevant
records, going back 130 kyr. It was systematically
weaker during the early and middle Holocene, and
model studies indicate that this results from
reduced amplification in the late summer and early
fall, a consequence of the altered mean climate in
response to boreal summer perihelion. Data from
corals shows substantial decadal and longer
variations in the strength of the ENSO cycle within
the past 1000 yr; it is suggested that this may be
due to solar and volcanic variations in solar
insolation, amplified by the Bjerknes
feedback. There is some evidence that this feedback
has operated in the 20th century and some model
results indicate that it will hold sway in the
greenhouse future, but it is very far from
conclusive. The comprehensive general circulation
models used for future climate projections leave us
with an indeterminate picture of ENSO's future. Some
predict more ENSO activity, some less, with the
highly uncertain consensus forecast indicating

States have been observed since the mid-twentieth
century. These include a reduction in the amount of
precipitation arriving as snow, a decline in
snowpack at low and midelevations, and a shift
toward earlier arrival of both snowmelt and the
centroid (center of mass) of streamflows. To project
future water supply reliability, it is crucial to
obtain a better understanding of the underlying
cause or causes for these changes. A regional
warming is often posited as the cause of these
changes without formal testing of different
competitive explanations for the warming. In this
study, a rigorous detection and attribution analysis
is performed to determine the causes of the late
winter/early spring changes in hydrologically
relevant temperature variables over mountain ranges
of the western United States. Natural internal
climate variability, as estimated from two long
control climate model simulations, is insufficient
to explain the rapid increase in daily minimum and
maximum temperatures, the sharp decline in frost
days, and the rise in degree-days above 0 degrees C
(a simple proxy for temperature-driven
snowmelt). These observed changes are also
inconsistent with the model-predicted responses to
variability in solar irradiance and volcanic
activity. The observations are consistent with
climate simulations that include the combined
effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and
aerosols. It is found that, for each temperature
variable considered, an anthropogenic signal is
identifiable in observational fields. The results
are robust to uncertainties in model-estimated
fingerprints and natural variability noise, to the
choice of statistical down-scaling method, and to
various processing options in the detection and
attribution method.},

changes in precipitation minus evaporation, P-E,
caused thermodynamically by changes in specific
humidity, dynamically by changes in circulation, and
by changes in moisture transports by transient
eddies are evaluated. The thermodynamic and dynamic
contributions are further separated into advective
and divergent components. The nonthermodynamic
contributions are then related to changes in the
mean and transient circulation. The projected change
in P-E involves an intensification of the existing
pattern of P-E with wet areas [the intertropical
convergence zone (ITCZ) and mid-to high latitudes]
getting wetter and arid and semiarid regions of the
subtropics getting drier. In addition, the
subtropical dry zones expand poleward. The
accentuation of the twentieth-century pattern of P-E
is in part explained by increases in specific
humidity via both advection and divergence
terms. Weakening of the tropical divergent
circulation partially opposes the thermodynamic
contribution by creating a tendency to decreased P-E
in the ITCZ and to increased P-E in the descending
branches of the Walker and Hadley cells. The
changing mean circulation also causes decreased P 2
E on the poleward flanks of the subtropics because
the descending branch of the Hadley Cell expands and
the midlatitude meridional circulation cell shifts
poleward. Subtropical drying and poleward moistening
are also contributed to by an increase in poleward
moisture transport by transient eddies. The
thermodynamic contribution to changing P-E, arising
from increased specific humidity, is almost entirely
accounted for by atmospheric warming under fixed
relative humidity.},

   abstract = {Global-mean surface temperature is affected by both
natural variability and anthropogenic forcing. This
study is concerned with identifying and removing
from global-mean temperatures the signatures of
natural climate variability over the period January
1900-March 2009. A series of simple, physically
based methodologies are developed and applied to
isolate the climate impacts of three known sources
of natural variability: the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO), variations in the advection of
marine air masses over the high-latitude continents
during winter, and aerosols injected into the
stratosphere by explosive volcanic eruptions. After
the effects of ENSO and high-latitude temperature
advection are removed from the global-mean
temperature record, the signatures of volcanic
eruptions and changes in instrumentation become more
clearly apparent. After the volcanic eruptions are
subsequently filtered from the record, the residual
time series reveals a nearly monotonic global
warming pattern since similar to 1950. The results
also reveal coupling between the land and ocean
areas on the interannual time scale that transcends
the effects of ENSO and volcanic eruptions. Globally
averaged land and ocean temperatures are most
strongly correlated when ocean leads land by; 2-3
months. These coupled fluctuations exhibit a
complicated spatial signature with largest-amplitude
sea surface temperature perturbations over the
Atlantic Ocean.},

   abstract = {Assessing carbon sink-source relationships in
peatlands must be based on the understanding of
processes responsible for long-term carbon
accumulation patterns. In contrast with ombrogeneous
bogs, however, the processes in geogeneous fens are
poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution
Holocene peat accumulation and macrofossil data from
a rich fen (Upper Pinto Fen (UPF)) in west-central
Alberta, Canada. The similar to8000-year chronology
of a 397 cm peat core was controlled by 20
accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dates. The
paludified peatland initially consisted of diverse
brown moss species and some Larix trees but was
dominated by Scorpidium scorpioides from 6500 to
1300 calibrated years BR The last 1300 years are
characterized by the reappearance of Larix together
with abundant woody materials and Cyperaccae,
culminating in a sharp increase in Tomenthypnum
nitens in the last several decades. During the
Scorpidium-dominated period, the peat accumulation
pattern derived from 15 14 C dates and 260 bulk
density measurements indicates declining mass
accumulation rates over time (i.e., convex age-depth
curve), in contrast with the standard bog growth
model (i.e., concave curve). The analysis of the UPF
data using an extended model incorporating variable
peat addition rates (PAR) to the catotelm suggests a
unidirectional sevenfold decrease in PAR from 191.8
to 26.0 g dry mass.m(-2).year(-1) during the similar
to5000-year "convex period". Decreasing vegetation
production and (or) increasing acrotelm
decomposition could have produced the convex
pattern. Decreasing PAR might be owing to
autogenically induced changes in local hydrology and
nutrient availability, which are pronounced in the
moisture-limited climate of the region and in
peatlands that have a strong groundwater
influence. The convex-pattern model, explicit to the
height-induced long-term drying hypothesis, has
important implications for building simulation
models and for projecting future carbon dynamics of
peatlands. Prior to recent human disturbance, the
UPF site has a time-weighted mean carbon
accumulation rate of 31.1 g C.m(-2).year(-1),
ranging from 7.2 to 182.5 g C.m(-2).year(-1) during
the last 8000 years. This large variation results
from the gradual decline of long-term accumulation
and short-term climate-induced accumulation
"pulses". The results imply that in the absence of
climatic change, peatlands with a convex
accumulation pattern will reach their growth limit
sooner and that their carbon sequestration capacity
will decline faster than would be expected given the
concave-pattern model.},

   abstract = {[1] The global climate models for the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth
Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) predict very different
changes of rainfall over the Amazon under the SRES
A1B scenario for global climate change. Five of the
eleven models predict an increase of annual
rainfall, three models predict a decrease of
rainfall, and the other three models predict no
significant changes in the Amazon rainfall. We have
further examined two models. The UKMO-HadCM3 model
predicts an El Nino-like sea surface temperature
(SST) change and warming in the northern tropical
Atlantic which appear to enhance atmospheric
subsidence and consequently reduce clouds over the
Amazon. The resultant increase of surface solar
absorption causes a stronger surface sensible heat
flux and thus reduces relative humidity of the
surface air. These changes decrease the rate and
length of wet season rainfall and surface latent
heat flux. This decreased wet season rainfall leads
to drier soil during the subsequent dry season,
which in turn can delay the transition from the dry
to wet season. GISS-ER predicts a weaker SST warming
in the western Pacific and the southern tropical
Atlantic which increases moisture transport and
hence rainfall in the Amazon. In the southern Amazon
and Nordeste where the strongest rainfall increase
occurs, the resultant higher soil moisture supports
a higher surface latent heat flux during the dry and
transition season and leads to an earlier wet season
onset.},

sites were used to develop a proxy record of annual
(June to June) precipitation spanning the 1226 to
2001 AD interval for the Uinta Basin Watershed of
northeastern Utah. The reconstruction reveals
significant precipitation variability at interannual
to decadal scales. Single-year dry events before the
instrumental period tended to be more severe than
those after 1900. In general, decadal scale dry
events were longer and more severe prior to 1900. In
particular, dry events in the late 13th, 16th, and
18th Centuries surpass the magnitude and duration of
droughts seen in the Uinta Basin after 1900. The
last four decades of the 20th Century also represent
one of the wettest periods in the
reconstruction. The proxy record indicates that the
instrumental record (approximately 1900 to the
Present) underestimates the potential frequency and
severity of severe, sustained droughts in this area,
while over representing the prominence of wet
episodes. In the longer record, the empirical
probability of any decadal scale drought exceeding
the duration of the 1954 through 1964 drought is 94
percent, while the probability for any wet event
exceeding the duration of the 1965 through 1999 wet
spell is only 1 percent. Hence, estimates of future
water availability in the Uinta Basin and forecasts
for exports to the Colorado River, based on the 1961
to 1990 and 1971 to 2000 "normal" periods, may be
overly optimistic.},

Interesting differences emerge when the EOF analysis

Most of the global mean changes come from the high latitudes, especially over the ocean. All 24 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 models agree on these changes and, over the twenty-first century, average a phase delay of 5 days and an amplitude decrease of 5% for the global mean ocean surface temperature. Evidence is provided that the changes are mainly driven by sea ice loss: as sea ice melts during the twenty-first century, the previously unexposed open ocean increases the effective heat capacity of the surface layer, slowing and damping the temperature response. From the tropics to the midlatitudes, changes in phase and amplitude are smaller and less spatially uniform than near the poles but are still preva...},

characteristics and their application as
paleoclimate archives. Cave sediments can be
separated into two broad categories, elastic
sediments and chemical sediments. Of these,
stream-transported clastic sediments and calcite
speleothems are both the most common and also the
most useful as climatic records. Techniques for
dating cave sediments include radiocarbon and U/Th
dating of speleothems and paleomagnetic reversals
and cosmogenic isotope dating of clastic
sediments. Cosmogenic isotope dating of elastic
sediments in caves with multiple levels or which
occur at different elevations provide a geomorphic
record of cave ages and river system evolution over
the past 5 Ma. Isotope profiles, trace element
profiles, color banding and luminescence profiles of
speleothems, mainly stalagmites, produce a detailed
paleoclimate record with very high time resolution
over the past several hundred thousand years. There
is potential application of these methods to late
Holocene climates with implications for evaluation
of current concern over global warming.},

   abstract = {[1] In the South Pacific, interdecadal-decadal
oceanic and atmospheric variability, referred to as
the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), is most
pronounced in the South Pacific Convergence Zone
(SPCZ) salinity front region. Here we have used
annual average oxygen isotope (delta O-18) time
series from five coral cores collected from Fiji and
Tonga in this region to construct a Fiji-Tonga
Interdecadal-Decadal Pacific Oscillation (F-T IDPO)
index of low-frequency (> 9 and < 55 years) climate
variability back to 1650 A. D. We first demonstrate
the consistency between this F-T IDPO index and a
mean sea level (MSL) pressure-based SPCZ position
index (SPI) (1891-2000), thus verifying the ability
of coral delta O-18 to record past
interdecadal-decadal climatic variations in this
region back to 1891. The F-T IDPO index is then
shown to be synchronous with the IPO index
(1856-2000), suggesting that this coral-based index
effectively represents the interdecadal-decadal
scale climate variance back to 1650. The regularity
of the F-T IDPO index indicates that
interdecadal-decadal variability in the SPCZ region
has been relatively constant over the past 350 years
with a mean frequency of similar to 20 years
(variance peaks near 11 and 35 years). There is a
consistent antiphase correlation of the F-T IDPO
index and the interdecadal-decadal components in
equatorial Pacific coral delta O-18 series from
Maiana and Palmyra. This observation indicates that
the eastward expansion (westward contraction) of the
eastern salinity front of the Western Pacific Warm
Pool (WPWP) occurs simultaneously (+/-<= 1 year)
with the westward (eastward) shift of the SPCZ
salinity front during positive IPO (negative IPO)
phases. This is the same relationship observed
during the phases of the El Nino Southern
Oscillation.},

   abstract = {A number of studies have attempted to explain the
cause of decadal variability in the tropical Pacific
and explore its possible link to decadal variability
in the midlatitude Pacific. To investigate some of
the current theories of Pacific decadal variability,
a linear, wind-driven model, designed to simulate
only baroclinic wave dynamics, was forced with wind
stress anomalies in the Pacific Ocean basin from
1945 through 1992. An analysis technique designed to
isolate the decadal/interdecadal scale variability
from interannual ENSO variability was performed on
the model's thermocline depth anomaly (TDA). It was
found that the temporal and spatial patterns of the
observed tropical decadal sea surface temperatures
are consistent with our modeled TDA. Furthermore,
restricting the wind forcing to within 58 of the
equator does not substantially alter the
decadal/interdecadal variability of the equatorial
region. The authors conclude that the observed
decadal variability in the low-latitude Pacific is
primarily a linear dynamical response to tropical
wind forcing and does not directly require an
oceanic link to the midlatitudes. The question of
how tropical wind anomalies are generated is not
addressed. In addition, it is shown that in model
scenarios where the wind forcing is restricted to
the western equatorial Pacific, the 1976-77 climate
shift is still clearly visible as a dominant feature
of tropical decadal variability. The temporal
decadal signal of the model-generated TDA is more
pronounced during the eastern equatorial upwelling
season (July-September) than in the boreal
winter. This is consistent with the observed
seasonal bias in tracer and SST data from the
eastern equatorial Pacific.},

produce time series for the period 1916 - 2003 of
evapo-transpiration (ET), runoff, and soil moisture

term trends are evaluated. The results show that
trends in ET in spring and summer are determined
primarily by trends in precipitation and snowmelt
that determine water availability. From April to
June, ET trends are mostly positive due primarily to
earlier snowmelt and earlier emergence of snow-free
ground, and secondarily to increasing trends in
spring precipitation. From July to September trends
in ET are more strongly influenced by precipitation
trends, with the exception of areas (most notably
California) that receive little summer precipitation
and have experienced large changes in snowmelt
timing. Trends in the seasonal timing of ET are
modest, but during the period 1947 - 2003 when
temperature trends are large, they reflect a shift
of ET from midsummer to early summer and late
spring. As in other studies, it is found that runoff
is occurring earlier in spring, a trend that is
related primarily to increasing temperature, and is
most apparent during 1947 - 2003. Trends in the
annual runoff ratio, a variable critical to western
water management, are determined primarily by trends
in cool season precipitation, rather than changes in
the timing of runoff or ET. It was found that the
signature of temperature- related trends in runoff
and SM is strongly keyed to mean midwinter [December
- February (DJF)] temperatures. Areas with warmer
winter temperatures show increasing trends in the
runoff fraction as early as February, and colder
areas as late as June. Trends toward earlier spring
SM recharge are apparent and increasing trends in SM
on 1 April are evident over much of the region. The
1 July SM trends are less affected by snowmelt
changes and are controlled more by precipitation
trends.},

   abstract = {[1] The origins of the delayed increases in global
surface temperature accompanying El Nino events and
the implications for the role of diabatic processes
in El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are
explored. The evolution of global mean surface
temperatures, zonal means and fields of sea surface
temperatures, land surface temperatures,
precipitation, outgoing longwave radiation,
vertically integrated diabatic heating and
divergence of atmospheric energy transports, and
ocean heat content in the Pacific is documented
using correlation and regression analysis. For
1950-1998, ENSO linearly accounts for 0.06degreesC
of global surface temperature increase. Warming
events peak 3 months after SSTs in the Nino 3.4
region, somewhat less than is found in previous
studies. Warming at the surface progressively
extends to about +/-30 latitude with lags of several
months. While the development of ocean heat content
anomalies resembles that of the delayed oscillator
paradigm, the damping of anomalies through heat
fluxes into the atmosphere introduces a substantial
diabatic component to the discharge and recharge of
the ocean heat content. However, most of the delayed
warming outside of the tropical Pacific comes from
persistent changes in atmospheric circulation forced
from the tropical Pacific. A major part of the ocean
heat loss to the atmosphere is through evaporation
and thus is realized in the atmosphere as latent
heating in precipitation, which drives
teleconnections. Reduced precipitation and increased
solar radiation in Australia, Southeast Asia, parts
of Africa, and northern South America contribute to
surface warming that peaks several months after the
El Nino event. Teleconnections contribute to the
extensive warming over Alaska and western Canada
through a deeper Aleutian low and stronger southerly
flow into these regions 0-12 months later. The
1976/1977 climate shift and the effects of two major
volcanic eruptions in the past 2 decades are
reflected in different evolution of ENSO events. At
the surface, for 1979-1998 the warming in the
central equatorial Pacific develops from the west
and progresses eastward, while for 1950-1978 the
anomalous warming begins along the coast of South
America and spreads westward. The eastern Pacific
south of the equator warms 4-8 months later for
1979-1998 but cools from 1950 to 1978.},

empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) both have
primary relationships to El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) but feature rather different
vertical and spatial structures. By construction the
two patterns are orthogonal, but their signatures in
sea level pressure, precipitation, outgoing longwave
radiation (OLR), and tropospheric diabatic heating
are quite similar. Moreover, they are significantly
related, with EOF-2 leading EOF-1 by about 4 -6
months, indicating that they play complementary
roles in the evolution of ENSO events, and with each
mode playing greater or lesser roles in different
events and seasons. The dominant pattern (EOF-1) in
its positive sign features highly coherent zonal
mean warming throughout the tropical troposphere
from 30 degrees N to 30 degrees S that increases in
magnitude with height to 200 hPa, drops to zero
about 100 hPa at the tropopause, and has reverse
sign to 30 hPa with peak values at 70 hPa. It
correlates strongly with global mean surface
temperatures. EOF-2 emphasizes off-equatorial
centers of action and strong Rossby wave temperature
signatures that are coherent throughout the
troposphere, with the strongest values in the
Pacific that extend into the extratropics and a sign
reversal at and above 150 hPa. Near the surface,
both patterns feature boomerang-shaped opposite
temperatures in the western tropical and subtropical
Pacific, with similar sea level pressure patterns,
but with EOF-1 more focused in equatorial
regions. Both patterns are strongest during the
boreal winter half-year when anomalous precipitation
in the tropics and associated latent heating drive
teleconnections throughout the world. For El Nino in
northern winter EOF-1 has more precipitation in the
eastern tropical Pacific, while EOF-2 has much drier
conditions over northern Australia and the Indian
Ocean. In northern summer, the main differences are
in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean. Differences
in teleconnections suggest great sensitivity to
small changes in forcings in association with

temperatures over land and sea, and decreases in
monsoon rainfall are similar to the observed
trends. We also show that greenhouse gases and
sulfates, by themselves, do not account for the
magnitude or even the sign in many instances, of the
observed trends. Thus, our simulations suggest that
absorbing aerosols in atmospheric brown clouds may
have played a major role in the observed regional
climate and hydrological cycle changes and have
masked as much as 50% of the surface warming due to
the global increase in greenhouse gases. The
simulations also raise the possibility that, if

fluxes. Herein this mode of variability is called
the thermally coupled Walker (TCW) mode. It is a
robust feature of simulations with atmospheric
general circulation models (GCMs) coupled to simple
ocean mixed layers. Despite the absence of
interactive ocean dynamics in these simulations, the
spatial patterns of sea level pressure, surface
temperature, and precipitation variability
associated with the TCW are remarkably
realistic. This mode has a red spectrum indicating
persistence on interannual to decadal time scales
that appears to arise through an off-equatorial
trade wind-evaporation-surface temperature feedback
and cloud shortwave radiative effects in the central
Pacific. When dynamically coupled to the ocean (in
fully coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs), the main
change to this mode is increased interannual
variability in the eastern equatorial Pacific sea
surface temperature and teleconnections in the North
Pacific and equatorial Atlantic, though not all
coupled GCMs simulate this effect. Despite the
oversimplification due to the lack of interactive
ocean dynamics, the physical mechanisms leading to
the TCW should be active in the actual climate
system. Moreover, the robustness and realism of the
spatial patterns of this mode suggest that the
physics of the TCW can explain some of the primary
features of observed interannual and decadal
variability in the Pacific and the associated global
teleconnections.},

of the atmospheric circulation over the continent,
with a research literature that dates back almost
100 years. The authors review the wide range of past
and current research dealing with the meteorological
and climatological aspects of the North American
monsoon, highlighting historical development and
major research themes. The domain of the North
American monsoon is large, extending over much of
the western United States from its region of
greatest influence in northwestern Mexico. Regarding
the debate over moisture source regions and water
vapor advection into southwestern North America,
there is general agreement that the bulk of monsoon
moisture is advected at low levels from the eastern
tropical Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California,
while the Gulf of Mexico may contribute some
upper-level moisture (although mixing occurs over
the Sierra Madre Occidental). Surges of low-level
moisture from the Gulf of California are a
significant part of intraseasonal monsoon
variability, and they are associated with the
configuration of upper-level midlatitude troughs and
tropical easterly waves at the synoptic scale, as
well as the presence of low-level jets, a thermal
low, and associated dynamics (including the
important effects of local topography) at the
mesoscale. Seasonally, the gulf surges and the
latitudinal position of the midtropospheric
subtropical ridge over southwestern North America
appear to be responsible for much spatial and
temporal variability in precipitation. Interannual
variability of the North American monsoon system is
high, but it is not strongly linked to El Nino or
other common sources of interannual circulation
variability. Recent mesoscale field measurements
gathered during the South-West Area Monsoon Project
have highlighted the complex nature of the
monsoon-related severe storm environment and
associated difficulties in modeling and
forecasting.},

interdecadal variations in sea surface temperature
(SST) over the last similar to100 years has been
termed the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation
(IPO). To examine past variations in the IPO we have
generated time series of Sr/Ca and oxygen isotopes
(delta(18)O) from South Pacific Porites coral
colonies growing at Rarotonga (1997 to 1726) and
Fiji (1997 to 1780). At both sites skeletal Sr/Ca is
highly correlated with instrumental SST at least
back to similar to1970 and delta(18)O appears to
reflect both SST and South Pacific Convergence Zone
(SPCZ) effects on seawater delta(18)O. Comparison of
our results to a New Caledonia coral delta(18)O
record and to indices of interdecadal Pacific
climate variability demonstrates that these South
Pacific corals have accurately recorded twentieth
century variations in the IPO and SPCZ. The coral
records also indicate that higher amplitude and more
spatially coherent IPO-related variability existed
from 1880 to 1950 with notably poor between-site
correlations in the mid-1800s. These observations
suggest that the spatial IPO pattern in South
Pacific SST was significantly more complex and/or
poorly defined in the mid-1800s compared to that
observed in the twentieth century. Comparison with
North Pacific IPO indices also indicates that the
degree of cross-hemispheric symmetry of interdecadal
oceanographic variability has changed over time with
a lower correlation between the North and South
Pacific in the mid-1800s. This evidence suggests
that the spatial pattern of the IPO at least in the
South Pacific has varied over the last 300 years,
with a major reorganization occurring after similar
to1880 A.D.},

(November-April) precipitation was developed for
each climate division in Arizona and New Mexico from
a network of 19 tree-ring chronologies in the
southwestern USA. Linear regression (LR) and
artificial neural network (NN) models were used to
identify the cool-season precipitation signal in
tree rings. Using 1931-88 records, the stepwise LR
model was cross-validated with a leave-one-out
procedure and the NN was validated with a bootstrap
technique. The final models were also independently
validated using the 1896-1930 precipitation data. In
most of the climate divisions, both techniques can
successfully reconstruct dry and normal years, and
the NN seems to capture large precipitation events
and more variability better than the LR. In the 1000
year reconstructions. the NN also produces more
distinctive wet events and more variability, whereas
the LR produces more distinctive dry events. The
1000 year reconstructed precipitation from the two
models shows several sustained dry and wet periods
comparable to the 1950s drought (e.g. 16th century
mega drought) and to the post-1976 wet period (e.g.
1330s, 1610s). The impact of extreme periods on the
environment may be stronger during sudden reversals
from dry to wet, which were not uncommon throughout
the millennium, such as the 1610s wet interval that
followed the 16th century mega drought. The
instrumental records suggest that strong dry to wet
precipitation reversals in the past 1000 years might
be linked to strong shifts from cold to warm El

@article{hansen05_efficacy,
   abstract = {[1] We use a global climate model to compare the
effectiveness of many climate forcing agents for
producing climate change. We find a substantial
range in the "efficacy'' of different forcings,
where the efficacy is the global temperature
response per unit forcing relative to the response
to CO2 forcing. Anthropogenic CH4 has efficacy
similar to 110%, which increases to similar to
145% when its indirect effects on stratospheric H2O
and tropospheric O-3 are included, yielding an
effective climate forcing of similar to 0.8 W/m(2)
for the period 1750 - 2000 and making CH4 the
largest anthropogenic climate forcing other than
CO2. Black carbon (BC) aerosols from biomass burning
have a calculated efficacy similar to 58%, while
fossil fuel BC has an efficacy similar to
78%. Accounting for forcing efficacies and for
indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes,
we find that fossil fuel soot, defined as BC + OC (
organic carbon), has a net positive forcing while
biomass burning BC + OC has a negative forcing. We
show that replacement of the traditional
instantaneous and adjusted forcings, Fi and Fa, with
an easily computed alternative, Fs, yields a better
predictor of climate change, i.e., its efficacies
are closer to unity. Fs is inferred from flux and
temperature changes in a fixed-ocean model
run. There is remarkable congruence in the spatial
distribution of climate change, normalized to the
same forcing Fs, for most climate forcing agents,
suggesting that the global forcing has more
relevance to regional climate change than may have
been anticipated. Increasing greenhouse gases
intensify the Hadley circulation in our model,
increasing rainfall in the Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ITCZ), Eastern United States, and East Asia,
while intensifying dry conditions in the subtropics
including the Southwest United States, the
Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and an
expanding Sahel. These features survive in model
simulations that use all estimated forcings for the
period 1880 - 2000. Responses to localized forcings,
such as land use change and heavy regional
concentrations of BC aerosols, include more specific
regional characteristics. We suggest that
anthropogenic tropospheric O-3 and the BC snow
albedo effect contribute substantially to rapid
warming and sea ice loss in the Arctic. As a
complement to a priori forcings, such as Fi, Fa, and
Fs, we tabulate the a posteriori effective forcing,
Fe, which is the product of the forcing and its
efficacy. Fe requires calculation of the climate
response and introduces greater model dependence,
but once it is calculated for a given amount of a
forcing agent it provides a good prediction of the
response to other forcing amounts.},

time series are generally altered by the presence of
errors in timing, i.e., when applied to

sampled between two time series which in truth
covary will generally be decreased by errors in
timing. Most previous work on this subject has
sought to maximize some goodness of fit between
time-uncertain series either heuristically or
through more quantitative methods. However, there is
a danger that unrelated records can be made to
appear to covary by time adjustment. Here we propose
a statistical test for the presence of covariance

probability of obtaining a maximum covariance from
randomly realized time-uncertain series is assessed
using the theory of order statistics. The results of
this analytical method provide insight into the
influence of timing errors upon covariance and are
shown to be consistent with results derived from a
Monte Carlo procedure. We apply this methodology to
evaluate the covariance between a time-uncertain

interpretation, that there is insignificant
covariance between the two at the 95% confidence

climate community. CCSM3 is a coupled climate model
with components representing the atmosphere, ocean,
sea ice, and land surface connected by a flux
coupler. CCSM3 is designed to produce realistic
simulations over a wide range of spatial
resolutions, enabling inexpensive simulations
lasting several millennia or detailed studies of
continental-scale dynamics, variability, and climate
change. This paper will show results from the
configuration used for climate-change simulations
with a T85 grid for the atmosphere and land and a
grid with approximately 1 degrees resolution for the
ocean and sea ice. The new system incorporates
several significant improvements in the physical
parameterizations. The enhancements in the model
physics are designed to reduce or eliminate several
systematic biases in the mean climate produced by
previous editions of CCSM. These include new
treatments of cloud processes, aerosol radiative
forcing, land-atmosphere fluxes, ocean mixed layer
processes, and sea ice dynamics. There are
significant improvements in the sea ice thickness,
polar radiation budgets, tropical sea surface
temperatures, and cloud radiative effects. CCSM3 can
produce stable climate simulations of millennial
duration without ad hoc adjustments to the fluxes
exchanged among the component models. Nonetheless,
there are still systematic biases in the
ocean-atmosphere fluxes in coastal regions west of
continents, the spectrum of ENSO variability, the
spatial distribution of precipitation in the
tropical oceans, and continental precipitation and
surface air temperatures. Work is under way to
extend CCSM to a more accurate and comprehensive

   abstract = {Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures over the
past 8000 years have been paced by the slow decrease
in summer insolation resulting from the precession
of the equinoxes. However, the causes of superposed
century-scale cold summer anomalies, of which the
Little Ice Age (LIA) is the most extreme, remain
debated, largely because the natural forcings are
either weak or, in the case of volcanism, short
lived. Here we present precisely dated records of
ice-cap growth from Arctic Canada and Iceland
showing that LIA summer cold and ice growth began
abruptly between 1275 and 1300 AD, followed by a
substantial intensification 14301455 AD. Intervals
of sudden ice growth coincide with two of the most
volcanically perturbed half centuries of the past
millennium. A transient climate model simulation
shows that explosive volcanism produces abrupt
summer cooling at these times, and that cold summers
can be maintained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks long
after volcanic aerosols are removed. Our results
suggest that the onset of the LIA can be linked to
an unusual 50-year-long episode with four large
sulfur-rich explosive eruptions, each with global
sulfate loading >60 Tg. The persistence of cold
summers is best explained by consequent
sea-ice/ocean feedbacks during a hemispheric summer
insolation minimum; large changes in solar
irradiance are not required. Citation: Miller,

South China Sea, represents a skeleton secreted in
the period from 1906 to 1994. The Sr contents of the
coral vary linearly with the instrument-measured
sea-surface temperature (SST), giving a Sr
thermometer: SST = - 1.9658 x Sr + 193.26. The
reconstructed SST data show that the late 20th
century was warmer (about 1 degreesC) than the early
20th century and that two cooling (1915/1916 and
1947/1948) and three warming (1935/1936, 1960/1961,
and 1976/1977) shifts occurred in the century. The
temperature shifts are more pronounced for winters,
implying a close effect of the west Pacific warm
pool and Asian monsoon and suggesting that the
former is a primary force controlling the climatic
system of the region. Results of this study and
previously published data indicate a close link of
temperature shifts between the boreal summer and the
austral winter or the boreal winter and the austral
summer. The annual SST anomalies in the South China
Sea and the South Pacific reveal the existence of
harmonic but opposite SST variations between the two
regions. On the decadal scale the comparative annual
SST anomalies for the South China Sea and for the
equatorial west Pacific show a similarity in
temperature variations, implying that the South
China Sea climate is coherent with climatic regime
of the tropical west Pacific.},

changes in the abundance of sedimentary charcoal
found in lake and bog sediments. When analysed with
pollen data, inferences can be made about past
vegetation dynamics and climate as well. The
analysis of high-resolution charcoal records
generally involves the decomposition of charcoal
influx into (a) a slowly varying 'background'
component that provides information about long-term
changes in regional fire activity, biomass and/or
depositional processes, and (b) a 'peaks' component
that represents local fire events. In this study, 15
high-resolution charcoal records from the
northwestern USA and associated pollen data were
examined to describe the variations and controls of
charcoal influx and background trends. Late-Holocene
charcoal influx levels at each site were compared
with late-Holocene sedimentation rates, vegetation
and fire frequency, and with modern climate and
physical site characteristics to better understand
the spatial variability in charcoal
abundance. Charcoal abundance was largely determined
by physical site characteristics (eg, lake and
watershed size) and the proportion of woody
taxa. Background trends displayed regional
similarities, - closely with woody taxa proportions
in and the subcontinental scale trend based on all
records correlated the pollen spectra. Background
charcoal and woody taxa proportions increased
together from minima in the Late Glacial to maxima
in the late Holocene. The strong similarity in these
trends suggests that background charcoal influx is a
function of fuel characteristics, which in turn are
governed by climate and vegetation. Variations in
sedimentation rate and fire frequency had little
influence on background charcoal trends.},

   abstract = {The causes of persistent droughts and wet periods,
or pluvials, over western North America are examined
in model simulations of the period from 1856 to
2000. The simulations used either (i) global sea
surface temperature data as a lower boundary
condition or (ii) observed data in just the tropical
Pacific and computed the surface ocean temperature
elsewhere with a simple ocean model. With both
arrangements, the model was able to simulate many
aspects of the low-frequency (periods greater than 6
yr) variations of precipitation over the Great
Plains and in the American Southwest including much
of the nineteenth-century variability, the droughts
of the 1930s (the "Dust Bowl") and 1950s, and the
very wet period in the 1990s. Results indicate that
the persistent droughts and pluvials were ultimately
forced by persistent variations of tropical Pacific
surface ocean temperatures. It is argued that ocean
temperature variations outside of the tropical
Pacific, but forced from the tropical Pacific, act
to strengthen the droughts and pluvials. The
persistent precipitation variations are part of a
pattern of global variations that have a strong
hemispherically and zonally symmetric component,
which is akin to interannual variability, and that
can be explained in terms of interactions between
tropical ocean temperature variations, the
subtropical jets, transient eddies, and the
eddy-driven mean meridional circulation. Rossby wave
propagation poleward and eastward from the tropical
Pacific heating anomalies disrupts the zonal
symmetry, intensifying droughts and pluvials over
North America. Both mechanisms of tropical driving
of extratropical precipitation variations work in
summer as well as winter and can explain the
year-round nature of the precipitation
variations. In addition, land-atmosphere
interactions over North America appear important by
(i) translating winter precipitation variations into
summer evaporation and, hence, precipitation
anomalies and (ii) shifting the northward flow of
moisture around the North Atlantic subtropical
anticyclone eastward from the Plains and Southwest
to the eastern seaboard and western Atlantic Ocean.},

Yet scant attention has been paid to designing convective representations that attempt to handle water vapor with fidelity, and even less to evaluating their performance. Here the authors attempt to address this deficiency by designing a representation of cumulus convection with close attention paid to convective water fluxes and by subjecting the scheme to rigorous tests using sounding array data. The authors maintain that such tests, in which a single-column model is forced by large-scale processes measured by or inferred from the sounding data, must be carried out over a period at least as long as the radiative-subsidence timescale—about 30 days—governing the water vapor adjustment time.

issues related to the implementation of an advanced

adopted here is that the land surface model should
be able to provide not only reasonable diurnal
variations of surface heat fluxes as surface
boundary conditions for coupled models, but also
correct seasonal evolutions of soil moisture in the
context of a long-term data assimilation system. In
a similar way to that in which the modified Oregon
State University land surface model (LSM) has been
used in the NCEP global and regional forecast
models, it is implemented in MM5 to facilitate the
initialization of soil moisture. Also, 1-km
resolution vegetation and soil texture maps are
introduced in the coupled MM5-LSM system to help
identify vegetation/water/ soil characteristics at
fine scales and capture the feedback of these land
surface forcings. A monthly varying climatological
0.15 degrees x 0.15 degrees green vegetation
fraction is utilized to represent the annual control
of vegetation on the surface
evaporation. Specification of various vegetation and
soil parameters is discussed, and the available
water capacity in the LSM is extended to account for
subgrid-scale heterogeneity. The coupling of the LSM
to MM5 is also sensitive to the treatment of the
surface layer, especially the calculation of the
roughness length for heat/moisture. Including the
effect of the molecular sublayer can improve the
simulation of surface heat flux. It is shown that
the soil thermal and hydraulic conductivities and
the surface energy balance are very sensitive to
soil moisture changes. Hence, it is necessary to
establish an appropriate soil moisture data

   abstract = {Progress toward understanding the causes of and
physical mechanisms involved in the 1988 North
American drought is reported. An earlier study
demonstrated that major sea surface temperature
(SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean, in
association with the 1988 La Nina, may have
disrupted atmospheric heating patterns by changing
the location and intensity of the intertropical
convergence zone and that such heating anomalies
could have initiated the circulation anomalies
across North America responsible for the drought. A
key issue of when the drought circulation anomalies
developed and their relation to changes in tropical
Pacific SSTs is examined. Although unusually dry
soil moisture and heat waves persisted into August,
the anomalous atmospheric conditions that brought on
the drought occurred in April, May, and June of
1988. The evolution of the Pacific SSTs and
tropical convection, as revealed by outgoing
longwave radiation, is shown to be consistent with
the development of the conditions favorable for
initiating the drought circulation pattern in April
through June of 1988. On the equator at
110-degrees-W, SST anomalies exceeded
-2.75-degrees-C in only April, May, and June and
were largest (-4.1-degrees-C) in May 1988. The
issues of how the 1988 La Nina differed from those
in the past and the importance of the whole SST
field in determining the anomalous diabatic heating
are also discussed. Diagnostic calculations of
atmospheric diabatic heating confirm that
atmospheric heating anomalies existed in the
tropical Pacific in association with the major SST
anomalies during this time. The link between the
anomalous heating and the tropical SSTs supports the
view that influences external to the atmosphere were
important and that the drought was not generated
solely by mechanisms internal to the atmosphere.
The distribution of diagnosed heating anomalies over
North America, together with a planetary wave model
response to idealized forcing, is described to
clarify the possible role of soil moisture anomalies
in perpetuating the drought. It is argued that
feedback-caused soil moisture anomalies may have
been secondary sources for the drought circulation
but could not have been the primary instigator. For
the most part, other diagnosed heating anomalies
during the drought are found to have little
influence on the North American region. Criteria to
help judge the ability of general circulation models
to simulate the drought are discussed.},

   abstract = {[1] The structure of the Northern Hemisphere annular
mode (NAM) is shown to be significantly different
during warm and cold winters of the ENSO
cycle. During warm winters the Arctic center of
action of the annular mode is more prominent and
extends deeper into Siberia, its related surface air
temperature signal is stronger, and the compensating
outer ring in the sea-level pressure field is much
broader, encompassing the entire tropics. During
cold winters the NAM signature is much more
pronounced over the Pacific sector: the sea-level
pressure pattern exhibits a North Pacific center of
action, positively correlated with the Atlantic
center, and pronounced deflections of the storm
track are also evident. It is suggested that the
former features are associated with the equatorward
displacement of the jet stream and the storm tracks
during warm winters of the ENSO cycle and the latter
is related to the the more pronounced break in the
subtropical jet stream over the Pacific sector
during cold winters.},

   abstract = {Rainfall variability over the Amazon basin has often
been linked to variations in Pacific sea surface
temperature (SST), and in particular, to the El
Nio/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, only a
fraction of Amazon rainfall variability can be
explained by ENSO. Building upon the recent work of
Zeng (Environ Res Lett 3:014002, 2008), here we
provide further evidence for an influence on Amazon
rainfall from the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The
strength of the North Atlantic influence is found to
be comparable to the better-known Pacific ENSO
connection. The tropical South Atlantic Ocean also
shows some influence during the wet-to-dry season
transition period. The Atlantic influence is through
changes in the north-south divergent circulation and
the movement of the ITCZ following warm
SST. Therefore, it is strongest in the southern part
of the Amazon basin during the Amazon's dry season
(July-October). In contrast, the ENSO related
teleconnection is through anomalous east-west Walker
circulation with largely concentrated in the eastern
(lower) Amazon. This ENSO connection is seasonally
locked to boreal winter. A complication due to the
influence of ENSO on Atlantic SST causes an apparent
North Atlantic SST lag of Amazon rainfall. Removing
ENSO from North Atlantic SST via linear regression
resolves this causality problem in that the residual
Atlantic variability correlates well and is in phase
with the Amazon rainfall. A strong Atlantic
influence during boreal summer and autumn is
particularly significant in terms of the impact on
the hydro-ecosystem which is most vulnerable during
the dry season, as highlighted by the severe 2005
Amazon drought. Such findings have implications for
both seasonal-interannual climate prediction and
understanding the longer-term changes of the Amazon
rainforest.},

   abstract = {[1] Three prominent quasi-global patterns of
variability and change are observed using the Met
Office's sea surface temperature (SST) analysis and
almost independent night marine air temperature
analysis. The first is a global warming signal that
is very highly correlated with global mean SST. The
second is a decadal to multidecadal fluctuation with
some geographical similarity to the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO). It is associated with the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and its
Pacific-wide manifestation has been termed the
Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). We present
model investigations of the relationship between the
IPO and ENSO. The third mode is an interhemispheric
variation on multidecadal timescales which, in view
of climate model experiments, is likely to be at
least partly due to natural variations in the
thermohaline circulation. Observed climatic impacts
of this mode also appear in model
simulations. Smaller-scale, regional atmospheric
phenomena also affect climate on decadal to
interdecadal timescales. We concentrate on one such
mode, the winter North Atlantic Oscillation
(NAO). This shows strong decadal to interdecadal
variability and a correspondingly strong influence
on surface climate variability which is largely
additional to the effects of recent regional
anthropogenic climate change. The winter NAO is
likely influenced by both SST forcing and
stratospheric variability. A full understanding of
decadal changes in the NAO and European winter
climate may require a detailed representation of the
stratosphere that is hitherto missing in the major
climate models used to study climate change.},

low pressure over the northeastern Pacific, dry

consistent only during the high phase of the NPO,
which is associated with an anomalously cold

incomplete dataset and filling in missing values
with imputed values is generally a nonlinear
problem, which must be solved iteratively. The
expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian
data, an iterative method both for the estimation of
mean values and covariance matrices from incomplete
datasets and for the imputation of missing values,
is taken as the point of departure for the
development of a regularized EM algorithm. In
contrast to the conventional EM algorithm, the
regularized EM algorithm is applicable to sets of
climate data, in which the number of variables
typically exceeds the sample size. The regularized
EM algorithm is based on iterated analyses of linear
regressions of variables with missing values on
variables with available values, with regression
coefficients estimated by ridge regression, a
regularized regression method in which a continuous
regularization parameter controls the filtering of
the noise in the data. The regularization parameter
is determined by generalized cross- validation, such
as to minimize, approximately, the expected mean-
squared error of the imputed values. The regularized
EM algorithm can estimate, and exploit for the
imputation of missing values, both synchronic and
diachronic covariance matrices, which may contain
information on spatial covariability, stationary
temporal covariability, or cyclostationary temporal
covariability. A test of the regularized EM
algorithm with simulated surface temperature data
demonstrates that the algorithm is applicable to
typical sets of climate data and that it leads to
more accurate estimates of the missing values than a
conventional noniterative imputation technique.},

climate system, helping to drive atmospheric
circulations in the tropics by absorbing energy and
recycling about half of the rainfall that falls on
it. This region ( Amazonia) is also estimated to
contain about one-tenth of the total carbon stored
in land ecosystems, and to account for one-tenth of
global, net primary productivity(1). The resilience
of the forest to the combined pressures of
deforestation and global warming is therefore of
great concern(2), especially as some general
circulation models ( GCMs) predict a severe drying
of Amazonia in the twenty- first century(3-5). Here
we analyse these climate projections with reference
to the 2005 drought in western Amazonia, which was
associated(6) with unusually warm North Atlantic sea
surface temperatures ( SSTs). We show that reduction
of dry-season ( July - October) rainfall in western
Amazonia correlates well with an index of the north
- south SST gradient across the equatorial Atlantic
( the 'Atlantic N - S gradient'). Our climate model
is unusual among current GCMs in that it is able to
reproduce this relationship and also the observed
twentieth- century multidecadal variability in the
Atlantic N - S gradient(7), provided that the
effects of aerosols are included in the
model(8). Simulations for the twenty- first century
using the same model(3,8) show a strong tendency for
the SST conditions associated with the 2005 drought
to become much more common, owing to continuing
reductions in reflective aerosol pollution in the
Northern Hemisphere(9).},

forest (r approximate to 0.62 for deciduous trees
and 0.64 for mixed woodland) and tall grass (r
approximate to 0.46) and lowest for short grass (r
approximate to 0.37). The average correlation over
all land cover types was 0.61. Average SOS dates
were consistently earlier than Spring Index dates
across all land cover types. This finding and
limited native tree phenology data suggest that the
SOS technique detects understorey green-up in the
forest rather than overstorey species. The biweekly
temporal resolution of the satellite sensor data
placed an upper limit on prediction accuracy; thus,
year-to-year variations at individual sites were
typically small. Nevertheless, the correct biweek
SOS could be identified from the surface models 61%
of the time, and fl biweek 96% of the time. Further
temporal refinement of the satellite sensor
measurements is necessary in order to connect them
with surface phenology adequately and to develop
links among 'green wave' components in selected
biomes.},

@article{newman07_predictability,
   abstract = {A multivariate empirical model is used to show that
predictability of the dominant patterns of tropical
and North Pacific oceanic variability, El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific
decadal oscillation (PDO), is mostly limited to
little more than a year, despite the presence of
spectral peaks on decadal time scales. The model
used is a linear inverse model (LIM) derived from
the observed simultaneous and 1-yr lag correlation
statistics of July-June-averaged SST from the Hadley
Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature
(HadISST) dataset for the years 1900-2002. The model
accurately reproduces the power spectra of the data,
including interannual and interdecadal spectral
peaks that are significant relative to univariate
red noise. Eigenanalysis of the linear dynamical
operator yields propagating eigenmodes that
correspond to these peaks but have very short decay
times and, thus, limited predictability.
Longer-term predictability does exist, however, due
to two stationary eigenmodes that are more weakly
damped. These eigenmodes do not strongly correspond
to the canonical ENSO and PDO patterns. Instead, one
is similar to the 1900-2002 trend and might
represent anthropogenic effects, while the second
represents multidecadal fluctuations of a pattern
that potentially represents natural decadal
variability; however, neither attribution can be
made unambiguously with the analysis presented in
this paper. Predictability of these two stationary
eigenmodes is significantly enhanced by
tropical-North Pacific coupling. Neither stationary
eigenmode is well captured in the control run of any
coupled GCM in the CMIP-3 project of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), perhaps because in
all of the GCMs tropical SST decadal variability is
too weak and North Pacific SSTs are too independent
of the Tropics. A key implication of this analysis
is that the PDO may represent not a single physical
mode but rather the sum of several phenomena, each
of which represents a different red noise with its
own autocorrelation time scale and spatial
pattern. The sum of these red noises can give rise
to apparent PDO "regime shifts" and seeming
characteristics of a long memory process. Such
shifts are not predictable beyond the time scale of
the most rapidly decorrelating noise, less than two
years, although the expected duration of regimes may
be determined from the relative amplitudes of
different eigenmodes.},

   abstract = {Simulations of the climatic response to mid-Holocene
(6 ka BP) orbital forcing with two coupled
ocean-atmosphere models (FOAM and CSM) show
enhancement of monsoonal precipitation in parts of
the American Southwest. Central America and
northernmost South America during Northern
Hemisphere summer. The enhanced onshore flow that
brings precipitation into Central America is caused
by a northward displacement of the inter-tropical
convergence zone, driven by cooling of the
equatorial and warming of the northern subtropical
and mid-latitude ocean. Ocean feedbacks also enhance
precipitation over the American Southwest, although
the increase in monsoon precipitation there is
largely driven by increases in land-surface
temperature. The northward shift in the equatorial
precipitation band that causes enhanced
precipitation in Central America and the American
Southwest has a negative feedback effect on
monsoonal precipitation in northern South
America. The simulations demonstrate that
mid-Holocene aridity in the mid-continent of North
America is dynamically linked to the orbitally
induced enhancement of the summer monsoon in the
American Southwest, with a spatial structure (wet in
the Southwest and dry in the mid-continent) similar
to that found in strong monsoon years today. Changes
in winter precipitation along the west coast of
North America, in Central America and along the Gulf
Coast, caused by southward-displacement of the
westerly storm tracks, indicate that changes in the
Northern Hemisphere winter monsoon also play a role
in regional climate changes during the
mid-Holocene. Although the simulations with FOAM and
CSM differ in detail, the general mechanisms and
patterns are common to both. The model results thus
provide a coherent dynamical explanation for
regional patterns of increased or decreased aridity
shown by vegetation, lake status and aeolian data
from the Americas.},

southwestern North America during El Ninos and a
more northern route into the Pacific Northwest
during La Ninas. Daily reanalysis data are analyzed
to confirm these changes. Seasonal mean upper
tropospheric eddy statistics show, for El Ninos (La
Ninas), a pattern that is shifted southward
(northward) compared with climatology. Paths of
coherent phase propagation of transient eddies and
of the propagation of wave packets are analyzed. A
coherent path of propagation across the Pacific
towards North America is identified that is more
zonal during El Nino winters and, during La Ninas,
has a dominant path heading northeastward to the
Pacific Northwest. A second path heading
southeastward from the central Pacific to the
tropical east Pacific is more accentuated during La
Ninas than El Ninos. These changes in wave
propagation are reproduced in an ensemble of
seasonal integrations of a general circulation model
forced by a tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature
pattern, confirming that the changes are forced by
changes in the mean atmospheric state arising from
changes in tropical sea-surface temperature. A
simplified model with a specified basic state is

surface temperature anomalies of opposite signs
existed in the tropical Pacific with strong La Nina
conditions in 1988 and a mature EI Nino in 1993. The
distribution of tropical convection in the
convergence zones and associated latent healing of
the atmosphere were correspondingly altered,
implying a large scale switch in the anomalous
tropical heating and forcing of extratropical quasi
stationary waves in the atmosphere, influencing the
subtropical jet stream over the North Pacific and
across North America. In 1988 the jet stream and the
closely related storm track of high-frequency
disturbances in the upper troposphere were displaced
into Canada well north of the normal location-the
farthest north of any year from 1979 to 1993. in
1993 a broader jet stream and the storm track were
displaced well south of normal to a more springlike
location across the United States the farthest south
by over 200 km of any year from 1979 to
1993. High-frequency eddy activity in the
Pacific-North American storm track is shown to
reinforce the anomalous jet streams in both
years. An analysis of the moisture budgets reveals a
stronger river of atmospheric moisture flowing
across the Gulf of Mexico into the central and
eastern United States Ln 1993. Also, in the lower
atmosphere, the storm track in 1993 was mon active,
and its lower latitude allowed the cyclonic
disturbances to tap into the moisture source,
transport moisture into the upper Mississippi River
basin, and precipitate it out. It is deduced that
local evaporation may have enhanced the
precipitation and helped perpetuate and prolong the
conditions. In contrast, in 1988 disturbances were
weaker and displaced far enough north to avoid most
of the moisture source, and the drought was
perpetuated by the dry conditions. Consequently,
these effects should be viewed as feedbacks that
amplify and prolong the response, while from the
standpoint of the atmosphere, the anomalous tropical
Pacific sea surface temperatures are a notable (but
not the sole) external forcing of the patterns .},

forecasts. Shea-term climate variability involves
much more than ENSO, and the challenge is to also
capitalize on long timescales associated with
anomalies in other parts of the climate system and
any additional predictability that goes beyond
simple persistence and build this into any
prediction scheme. The international framework for
helping to facilitate future research is
CLIVAR-GOALS, the WCRP program on climate
variability and predictability, and the subprogram
an the Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System. The
research challenges are many, but the prospects are
excellent for making further advances and the
potential is high for socioeconomic benefits for
many countries. Turning skillful but uncertain
forecasts into useful information and beneficial
decisions represents a particular challenge, so that
collaboration will be required between the physical
scientists and scientists from the applications and

Understanding relationships between continental-scale patterns of drought and modes of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) may explain how interannual to multidecadal variability in SSTs drives fire at continental scales. We used local wildfire chronologies reconstructed from fire scars on tree rings across western North America and independent reconstructions of SST developed from tree-ring widths at other sites to examine the relationships of multicentury patterns of climate and fire synchrony. From 33,039 annually resolved fire-scar dates at 238 sites (the largest paleofire record yet assembled), we examined forest fires at regional and subcontinental scales. Since 1550 CE, drought and forest fires covaried across the West, but in a manner contingent on SST modes. During certain phases of ENSO and PDO, fire was synchronous within broad subregions and sometimes asynchronous among those regions. In contrast, fires were most commonly synchronous across the West during warm phases of the AMO. ENSO and PDO were the main drivers of high-frequency variation in fire (interannual to decadal), whereas the AMO conditionally changed the strength and spatial influence of ENSO and PDO on wildfire occurrence at multidecadal scales. A current warming trend in AMO suggests that we may expect an increase in widespread, synchronous fires across the western U.S. in coming decades.},

between 54 and 346 years in length, were examined
for their local and larger-scale relationships (El
Nino-Southern Oscillation) with climate. Series were
examined in a consistent manner over the same time
periods and relationships were tested for stability
through time. The results demonstrate a spectrum of
climatic interpretation ranging from (1) no
significant relationship of the coral record with
either local or larger-scale climate variables, (2)
significant relationship of the coral record with
climate but the relationship is not stable through
time, and (3) the coral record shows a significant
and temporally stable relationship with climate
which explains a significant and useful proportion
of climate variance. It is concluded that reliance,
to date, on analyzing only one long coral core from
a site has prevented identification of coral records
or parts of coral records where non-climatic factors
are dominating the geochemical signal. Various
factors may cause these non-climatic signals to
dominate. More process studies into how corals of
particular species, with various growth rates and
from various environmental settings incorporate
geochemical tracers into their skeleton are required
to understand exactly what is being measured. In
addition, it is recommended that some level of
replication (ideally, three separate corals) of
geochemical tracers will ensure accurate dating of
the record, identification of periods when
non-climatic factors dominate and thus enhance the
reliability of the paleoclimatic record. Such an
approach will allow the rich archive of
environmental information contained in massive coral
skeletons to make a significant contribution to
high-resolution paleoclimatology and improve our
understanding of the nature and causes of past

The authors also study the SAL simulated in the National Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmosphere Model, version 3 (CAM3), coupled with dust radiative effect. It is found that higher AOT is associated with warmer and dryer anomalies below 700 hPa, which increases the atmospheric stability.

shows that vegetation dynamics may play a major role

Amazon. Despite the large amount of annual
precipitation, the presence of a dry season (albeit
short) facilitates a strong impact of dynamic
vegetation on precipitation persistence in the
model. The year-to-year variation of net primary
productivity (NPP) is dominated by that of the dry
season NPP. As a result, above-normal (below-normal)
precipitation in a particular year can enhance
(suppress) vegetation growth, leading to widespread
increase (decrease) of vegetation density in the
subsequent year. Precipitation in the subsequent
year is therefore more likely to be above (below)
normal. This damping effect of vegetation enhances
low-frequency variability of precipitation and leads
to recurrent droughts or floods, a result previously

   abstract = {[1] Observations show that strong equatorial
volcanic eruptions have been followed by a
pronounced positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation
(AO) for one or two Northern Hemisphere winters. It
has been previously assumed that this effect is
forced by strengthening of the equator-to-pole
temperature gradient in the lower stratosphere,
caused by aerosol radiative heating in the
tropics. To understand atmospheric processes that
cause the AO response, we studied the impact of the
1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, which produced the
largest global volcanic aerosol cloud in the
twentieth century. A series of control and
perturbation experiments were conducted with the
GFDL SKYHI general circulation model to examine the
evolution of the circulation in the 2 years
following the Pinatubo eruption. In one set of
perturbation experiments, the full radiative effects
of the observed Pinatubo aerosol cloud were
included, while in another only the effects of the
aerosols in reducing the solar flux in the
troposphere were included, and the aerosol heating
effects in the stratosphere were suppressed. A third
set of perturbation experiments imposed the
stratospheric ozone losses observed in the
post-Pinatubo period. We conducted ensembles of four
to eight realizations for each case. Forced by
aerosols, SKYHI produces a statistically significant
positive phase of the AO in winter, as
observed. Ozone depletion causes a positive phase of
the AO in late winter and early spring by cooling
the lower stratosphere in high latitudes,
strengthening the polar night jet, and delaying the
final warming. A positive phase of the AO was also
produced in the experiment with only the
tropospheric effect of aerosols, showing that
aerosol heating in the lower tropical stratosphere
is not necessary to force positive AO response, as
was previously assumed. Aerosol-induced tropospheric
cooling in the subtropics decreases the meridional
temperature gradient in the winter troposphere
between 30degreesN and 60degreesN. The corresponding
reduction of mean zonal energy and amplitudes of
planetary waves in the troposphere decreases wave
activity flux into the lower stratosphere. The
resulting strengthening of the polar vortex forces a
positive phase of the AO. We suggest that this
mechanism can also contribute to the observed
long-term AO trend being caused by greenhouse gas
increases because they also weaken the tropospheric
meridional temperature gradient due to polar
amplification of warming.},

need to provide an observational dataset with

data assimilation method with background 'first

from a global numerical weather prediction
model. This directly yields a global analysis every
6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere,
and also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis.
The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of
global tropospheric variability, and of the
dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the
present at 6-hourly temporal and 2 degrees spatial
resolutions. Intercomparisons with independent
radiosonde data indicate that the reanalyses are

of upper-air and satellite data are equally

(CLIVAR) working group on drought recently initiated
a series of global climate model simulations forced
with idealized SST anomaly patterns, designed to
address a number of uncertainties regarding the
impact of SST forcing and the role of
land-atmosphere feedbacks on regional drought. The
runs were carried out with five different
atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) and
one coupled atmosphere-ocean model in which the
model was continuously nudged to the imposed SST
forcing. This paper provides an overview of the
experiments and some initial results focusing on the
responses to the leading patterns of annual mean SST
variability consisting of a Pacific El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO)-like pattern, a pattern that
resembles the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation
(AMO), and a global trend pattern. One of the key
findings is that all of the AGCMs produce broadly
similar (though different in detail) precipitation
responses to the Pacific forcing pattern, with a
cold Pacific leading to reduced precipitation and a
warm Pacific leading to enhanced precipitation over
most of the United States. While the response to the
response over the United States tends to occur when
the two oceans have anomalies of opposite
signs. Further highlights of the response over the
United States to the Pacific forcing include
precipitation signal-to-noise ratios that peak in
spring, and surface temperature signal-to-noise
ratios that are both lower and show less agreement
among the models than those found for the
precipitation response. The response to the positive
SST trend forcing pattern is an overall surface
warming over the world's land areas, with
substantial regional variations that are in part
reproduced in runs forced with a globally uniform
SST trend forcing. The precipitation response to the
trend forcing is weak in all of the models. It is
hoped that these early results, as well as those
reported in the other contributions to this special
issue on drought, will serve to stimulate further
analysis of these simulations, as well as suggest
new research on the physical mechanisms contributing

Perhaps the most striking result from this analysis is that many important targets for seasonal forecasting, including the PNA response, are most sensitive to SST anomalies in the Niño-4 region (5°N–5°S, 150°W–160°E) of the central tropical Pacific, with lesser and sometimes opposite s...},

   abstract = {The CSIRO Mark 2 coupled global climatic model has
been used to generate a 10,000-year simulation for
'present' climatic conditions. The model output has
been analysed to identify sustained climatic
fluctuations, such as those attributed to the
Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age
(LIA). Since no external forcing was permitted
during the model run all such fluctuations are
attributed to naturally occurring climatic
variability associated with the nonlinear processes
inherent in the climatic system. Comparison of
simulated climatic time series for different
geographical locations highlighted the lack of
synchronicity between these series. The model was
found to be able to simulate climatic extremes for
selected observations for century timescales, as
well as identifying the associated spatial
characteristics. Other examples of time series
simulated by the model for the USA and eastern
Russia had similar characteristics to those
attributed to the MWP and the LIA, but smaller
amplitudes, and clearly defined spatial patterns. A
search for the frequency of occurrence of specified
surface temperature anomalies, defined via duration
and mean value, revealed that these were primarily
confined to polar regions and northern latitudes of
Europe, Asia and North America. Over the majority of
the oceans and southern hemisphere such climatic
fluctuations could not be sustained, for reasons
explained in the paper. Similarly, sustained sea-ice
anomalies were mainly confined to the northern
hemisphere. An examination of mechanisms associated
with the sustained climatic fluctuations failed to
identify a role for the North Atlantic Oscillation,
the El Nino-Southern Oscillation or the Pacific
Decadal Oscillation. It was therefore concluded that
these fluctuations were generated by stochastic
processes intrinsic to the nonlinear climatic
system. While a number of characteristics of the MWP
and the LIA could have been partially caused by
natural processes within the climatic system, the
inability of the model to reproduce the observed
hemispheric mean temperature anomalies associated
with these events indicates that external forcing
must have been involved. Essentially the unforced
climatic system is unable to sustain the generation
of long-term climatic anomalies.},

   abstract = {A new and distinctly interdecadal signal in the
climate of the Pacific Ocean has been uncovered by
examining the Coupled behavior of sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) and Northern Hemisphere
atmospheric circulation. This interdecadal Pacific
signal (IPS) of ocean-atmosphere interaction
exhibits a highly statistically significant
interdecadal component vet contains little to no
interannual (El Nino scale) variability common to
other Pacific climate anomaly patterns. The IPS thus
represents the only empirically derived, distinctly
interdecadal signal of Pacific Ocean SST variability
that likely also represents the true interdecadal
behavior of the Pacific Ocean-atmosphere system. The
residual variability of the Pacific's leading SST
pattern, after removal of the IPS, is highly
correlated with El Nino anomalies. This indicates
that by simply including an atmospheric component,
the leading mode of Pacific SST variability has been
decomposed into its interdecadal and interannual
patterns. Although the interdecadal signal is
unrelated to interannual El Nino variability. the
interdecadal ocean-atmosphere variability still
seems closely linked to tropical Pacific
SSTs. Because prior abrupt changes in Pacific SSTs
have been related to anomalies in a variety of
physical and biotic parameters throughout the
Northern Hemisphere, and because of the persistence
of these changes over several decades. isolation of
this interdecadal signal in the Pacific
Ocean-atmosphere system has potentially important
and widespread implications to climate forecasting

It is based upon the idea that the convection scheme predicts the local concentration of condensed water (the in-cloud water content) produced at the subgrid scale, and that a statistical cloud scheme predicts how this condensed water is spatially distributed within the domain. The cloud scheme uses a probability distribution function (PDF) of the total water whose variance and skewness coefficient are diagnosed from the amount of condensed water produced at the subgrid scale by cumulus convection and at the large scale by supersaturation, from the degree of saturation of the environment, and from the lower bound of the total water distribution that is taken equal to zero.

   abstract = {The causes and global context of the North American
drought between 1998 and 2004 are examined using
atmospheric reanalyses and ensembles of atmosphere
model simulations variously forced by global SSTs or
tropical Pacific SSTs alone. The drought divides
into two distinct time intervals. Between 1998 and
2002 it coincided with a persistent La Ni (n) over
tildea-like state in the tropical Pacific, a cool
tropical troposphere, poleward shifted jet streams,
and, in the zonal mean, eddy-driven descent in
midlatitudes. During the winters reduced
precipitation over North America in the climate
models was sustained by anomalous subsidence and
reductions of moisture convergence by the stationary
flow and transient eddies. During the summers
reductions of evaporation and mean flow moisture
convergence drove the precipitation reduction, while
transient eddies acted diffusively to oppose
this. During these years the North American drought
fitted into a global pattern of circulation and
hydroclimate anomalies with noticeable zonal and
hemispheric symmetry. During the later period of
the drought, from 2002 to 2004, weak El Ni (n) over
tildeo conditions prevailed and, while the global
climate adjusted accordingly, western North America
remained, uniquely among midlatitude regions, in
drought. The ensemble mean of the climate model
simulations did not simulate the continuation of the
drought in these years, suggesting that the
termination of the drought was largely unpredictable
in terms of global ocean conditions. The global
context of the most recent, turn of the century,
drought is compared to the five prior persistent
North American droughts in the instrumental record
from the mid-nineteenth century on. A classic La Ni
(n) over tildea pattern of ocean temperature in the
Pacific is common to all. A cold Indian Ocean, also
typical of La Ni (n) over tildea, is common to all
five prior droughts, but not the most recent
one. Except in southern South America the global
pattern of precipitation anomalies of the turn of
the century drought is similar to that during the
five prior droughts. These comparisons suggest that
the earlier period of this most recent drought is
the latest in a series of multiyear droughts forced
by persistent changes in tropical Pacific Ocean
temperatures. Warm tropical North Atlantic Ocean
temperatures may play a secondary role.},

the vegetation was characterized by steppe
vegetation with isolated stands of Nothofagus. The
climate was generally dry, and the sparse vegetation
apparently lacked sufficient fuels to bum
extensively. After 15,000 cat yr BP, a mixture of
Nothofagus forest and shrubland/steppe
developed. Fire activity increased between 13,250
and 11,400 cat yr BP, contemporaneous with a
regionally defined cold dry period (Huelmo/Maseardi
Cold Reversal). The early-Holocene period was
characterized by an open Nothofagus forest/shrubland
mosaic, and fire frequency was high in dry sites and
low in wet sites; the data suggest a sharp decrease
in moisture eastward from the Andes. A shift to a
surface-fire regime occurred at 7500 cat yr BP at
the wet site and at 4400 cat yr BP at the dry site,
preceding the expansion of Austrocedrus by 1000-1500
yr. The spread of Austrocedrus is explained by a
shift towards a cooler and wetter climate in the
middle and late Holocene. The change to a
surface-fire regime is consistent with increased
interannual climate variability and the onset or
strengthening of ENSO. The present-day mixed forest

18.03(10(3)T(-1))-32.42 where alpha is the
fractionation factor, and T is in kelvins. Combining
new data for low-temperature precipitations and the
high-temperature equilibrium fractionations
published by O'Neil et al. (1969) results in a
revised expression for the oxygen isotope
fractionation between octavite (CdCO3) and water
from 0 degrees to 500 degrees C: 10001n
alpha(CdCO3-H2O) = 2.76(10(6)T(-2))-3.96 The ability
to produce nonequilibrium carbonates allowed
assessment to be made, for the first time, of the
temperature dependence of nonequilibrium stable
isotope fractionations in mineral systems. The
temperature coefficients of cu(carbonate-water) for
nonequilibrium divalent metal carbonates are greater
than those for equilibrium carbonates, a finding
that may bear on the interpretation of analyses of
biogenic carbonates forming out of isotopic
equilibrium in nature. New determinations of acid
fractionation factors (10001n alpha) at 25 degrees C
for calcite (10.44 +/- 0.10), aragonite (11.01 +/-
0.01), and witherite (10.57 +/- 0.16) are mildly to
strongly different from those published by Sharma
and Clayton (1965) and point to a control on this
fractionation by some physical property of the
mineral. Reproducible values for octavite (CdCO3)
varied from 11.18 to 13.60 depending on the
conditions of preparation of the carbonate. These
new values need to be considered in determinations
of absolute O-18/O-16 ratios of international
reference standards and in relating analyses of
carbonates to those of waters, silicates, and
oxides. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

   abstract = {Aims. We improve the description of the evolution of
the Sun's open and total magnetic flux on time
scales of years to millenia. Methods. In the model
employed here the evolution of the solar total and
open magnetic flux is computed from the flux
emerging at the solar surface in the form of bipolar
magnetic features, which is related to the sunspot
number cycle parameters and can be estimated from
historical records. Compared to earlier versions of
the model in addition to the long-lived open flux,
now also a more rapidly decaying component of the
open flux is considered. The model parameters are
constrained by comparing its output with
observations of the total surface magnetic flux and
with a reconstruction of the open magnetic flux
based on the geomagnetic indexes. A method to
compute the Sun's total magnetic flux and the
sunspot number during the Holocene, starting from
the open flux obtained from cosmogenic isotopes
records, is also presented. Results. By considering
separately a rapidly evolving and a slowly evolving
component of the open flux the model reproduces the
Sun's open flux, as reconstructed based on the
aa-index, much better and a reasonable description
of the radial component of interplanetary magnetic
field data is obtained. The greatest improvement is
in the reproduction of the cyclic variation of the
open flux, including the amplitudes of individual
cycles. Furthermore, we found that approximately
25% of the modeled open flux values since the end
of the Maunder minimum are lower than the averaged
value over 2008, i.e. during the current low
minimum. The same proportion is observed in
reconstructions of the open flux during the Holocene
based on cosmogenic isotopes, which suggests that
the present solar minimum conditions are below
average, but not exceptional in terms of the
heliospheric magnetic flux.},

   abstract = {The midlatitude response to tropical Pacific SST
anomalies involves changes in transient eddy
propagation, but the processes leading to the
transient eddy changes are still not clear. In a
recent study, we used a series of controlled general
circulation model (GCM) experiments in which an
imposed tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature
(SST) anomaly is turned on abruptly and the response
is analyzed in terms of its high-and low-frequency
parts, to show that the changes in transient eddies
induced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) arise
from changes in wave refraction on the altered mean
flow. In this work, we use a quasi-geostrophic
linear model and a linear stationary wave model, to
interpret the GCM experiments and obtain the
sequence of events that lead from a tropical SST
anomaly to the quasi-equilibrium change in the mean
and transient atmospheric circulation. The initial
direct response of the mean flow is confined to the
tropical and subtropical Pacific, similar to what is
obtained from a stationary wave model. This
tropical-subtropical mean flow change initiates a
transient eddy response, which induces a midlatitude
mean flow anomaly. The wave-mean flow system evolves
towards a state in which the eddy anomalies maintain
the mean flow anomalies, allowing them to
persist. It is further shown that, while eddy
momentum fluxes persistently accelerate and
decelerate the subtropical and midlatitude mean
flow, the eddy heat flux effect on the zonal mean
flow is much more variable, and only marginally
significant. The linear quasi-geostrophic model
calculations capture the evolution of eddy momentum
flux anomalies equatorwards of 60 degrees N quite
well, suggesting linear wave refraction can explain
the midlatitude ENSO anomalies. However, other
processes, like stationary waves or changes in the
nonlinear stage of eddy life cycles, are needed to
explain the ENSO-related anomalies at high
latitudes, polewards of around 60 degrees

   abstract = {The onset of spring is a critical time in
mid-latitude atmosphere-biosphere
interactions. Deciduous plants resume growth after
winter dormancy, and their activities cause land
surfaces to become more active agents in energy and
mass exchanges. The progress of spring plant
development driving these changes can be
conveniently monitored by observation of plant
life-stage (phenological) events. Thus, phenological
data can play a crucial role in understanding and
monitoring springtime vegetation and climate
dynamics, especially about potential changes over
time. Although global-scale phenological monitoring
is not yet possible, alternative strategies are
available to assess these impacts. In this paper, a
simple phenological model, driven by surface-level
daily maximum-minimum temperatures is employed as a
surrogate measure of the onset of spring in
China. Contrasting with results from similar studies
in North America and Europe, the onset of spring
plant growth in China has no apparent change over
1959-1993. However, during the same period, last
spring frost (-2.2degreesC) dates have become
markedly earlier (by 6 d), with the greatest change
occurring in the northeast portions of the
country. First autumn frost dates have also become
later (by 4 d), especially in north-central
China. Combining these 2 changes, the frost period
has decreased by 10 d over many northern regions of
the country. A shorting frost period is consistent
with decreasing diurnal temperature ranges and
day-to-day temperature differences during spring and
autumn in China, reported by previous research.},

@article{schubert04_long_term_drought,
   abstract = {The U.S. Great Plains experienced a number of
multiyear droughts during the last century, most
notably the droughts of the 1930s and 1950s. This
study examines the causes of such droughts using
ensembles of long-term (1930-2000) simulations
carried out with the NASA Seasonal-to-Interannual
Prediction Project (NSIPP-1) atmospheric general
circulation model (AGCM) forced with observed sea
surface temperatures (SSTs). The results show that
the model produces long-term (multiyear) variations
in precipitation in the Great Plains region
(30degrees-50degreesN, 95degrees-105degreesW) that
are similar to those observed. A correlative
analysis suggests that the ensemble-mean
low-frequency (time scales longer than about 6 yr)
rainfall variations in the Great Plains are linked
to a pan-Pacific pattern of SST variability that is
the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) in
the low-frequency SST data. The link between the SST
and the Great Plains precipitation is confirmed in
idealized AGCM simulations, in which the model is
forced by the two polarities of the pan-Pacific SST
pattern. The idealized simulations further show that
it is primarily the tropical part of the SST
anomalies that influences the Great Plains. As such,
the Great Plains tend to have above-normal
precipitation when the tropical Pacific SSTs are
above normal, while there is a tendency for drought
when the tropical SSTs are cold. The
upper-tropospheric response to the pan-Pacific SST
EOF shows a global-scale pattern with a strong wave
response in the Pacific and a substantial zonally
symmetric component in which U. S. Great Plains
pluvial (drought) conditions are associated with
reduced (enhanced) heights throughout the
extratropics. The potential predictability of
rainfall in the Great Plains associated with SSTs is
rather modest, with about one-third of the total
low-frequency rainfall variance being forced by SST
anomalies. Further idealized experiments with
climatological SST suggest that the remaining
low-frequency variance in the Great Plains
precipitation is the result of interactions with
soil moisture. In particular, simulations with soil
moisture feedback show a fivefold increase in the
variance in annual Great Plains precipitation
compared with simulations in which the soil feedback
is excluded. In addition to increasing variance, the
interactions with the soil introduce a year-to-year
memory in the hydrological cycle. The impact of soil
memory is consistent with a red noise process, in
which the deep soil is forced by white noise and
damped with a time scale of about 1.5 yr. As such,
the role of low-frequency SST variability is to
introduce a bias to the net forcing on the soil
moisture that drives the random process
preferentially to either wet or dry conditions.},

We show, however, that this basin has not warmed uniformly: Although the tropics and subtropics have warmed, the subpolar ocean has cooled. These regional differences require local surface heat flux changes (+/-4 watts per square meter) much larger than the basinwide average. Model investigations show that these regional differences can be explained by large-scale, decadal variability in wind and buoyancy forcing as measured by the North Atlantic Oscillation index. Whether the overall heat gain is due to anthropogenic warming is difficult to confirm because strong natural variability in this ocean basin is potentially masking such input at the present time.},

classified into models which use atmospheric (sea

models consist of coupled ocean-atmosphere models of
varying degrees of complexity, ranging from
simplified coupled models of the "shallow water"

considerably better than the persistence forecast in

a success from this perspective. However, despite
the demonstrated predictability, little is known
about ENSO predictability limits and the
predictability of phenomena outside the tropical
Pacific. Furthermore, the predictability of
anomalous features known to be associated with ENSO

different physical mechanisms (in the ocean or

structure of teleconnections between both the winter
El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and global sea
surface temperatures (SSTs), and a measure of
continental U.S. summer drought during the twentieth
century. Potential nonlinearities and
nonstationarities in the relationships are
noted. During the first three decades of this
century, summer drought teleconnections in response
to SST patterns linked to ENSO are found to be
strongest in the southern regions of Texas, with
extensions into regions of the Midwest. From the
1930s through the 1950s, the drought teleconnection
pattern is found to extend into southern
Arizona. The most recent three decades show weak
teleconnections between summer drought over southern
Texas and Arizona, and winter SSTs, which is
consistent with previous findings. Instead, the
response to Pacific SSTs shows a clear shift to the
western United States and southern regions of
California. These epochal variations are consistent
with epochal variations observed in ENSO and other
low-frequency climate indicators. This changing
teleconnection response complicates statistical
forecasting of drought.},

significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade
towards the poles ( or metres per decade upward),
and significant mean advancement of spring events by
2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic
fingerprint of temporal and spatial `sign-switching'
responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century
climate trends. Among appropriate
long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this

Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists.

   abstract = {Multi-year to decadal variability in a 100-year
integration of a BMRC coupled atmosphere-ocean
general circulation model (CGCM) is examined. The
fractional contribution made by the decadal
component generally increases with depth and
latitude away from surface waters in the equatorial
Indo-Pacific Ocean. The relative importance of
decadal variability is enhanced in off-equatorial
"wings" in the subtropical eastern Pacific. The
model and observations exhibit "ENSO-like" decadal
patterns. Analytic results are derived, which show
that the patterns can, in theory, occur in the
absence of any predictability beyond ENSO
time-scales. In practice, however, modification to
this stochastic view is needed to account for robust
differences between ENSO-like decadal patterns and
their interannual counterparts. An analysis of
variability in the CGCM, a wind-forced shallow water
model, and a simple mixed layer model together with
existing and new theoretical results are used to
improve upon this stochastic paradigm and to provide
a new theory for the origin of decadal ENSO-like
patterns like the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation
and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In this theory,
ENSO-driven wind-stress variability forces internal
equatorially-trapped Kelvin waves that propagate
towards the eastern boundary. Kelvin waves can
excite reflected internal westward propagating
equatorially-trapped Rossby waves (RWs) and
coastally-trapped waves (CTWs). CTWs have no impact
on the off-equatorial sub-surface ocean outside the
coastal wave guide, whereas the RWs do. If the
frequency of the incident wave is too high, then
only CTWs are excited. At lower frequencies, both
CTWs and RWs can be excited. The lower the
frequency, the greater the fraction of energy
transmitted to RWs. This lowers the characteristic
frequency (reddens the spectrum) of variability off
the equator relative to its equatorial
counterpart. At low frequencies, dissipation acts as
an additional low pass filter that becomes more
effective, as latitude increases. At the same time,
ENSO-driven off-equatorial surface heating anomalies
drive mixed layer temperature responses in both
hemispheres. Both the eastern boundary interactions
and the accumulation of surface heat fluxes by the
surface mixed layer act to low pass filter the
ENSO-forcing. The resulting off-equatorial
variability is therefore more coherent with low pass
filtered (decadal) ENSO indices [e.g. NINO3
sea-surface temperature (SST)] than with unfiltered
ENSO indices. Consequently large correlations
between variability and NINO3 extend further
poleward on decadal time-scales than they do on
interannual time-scales. This explains why decadal
ENSO-like patterns have a broader meridional
structure than their interannual counterparts. This
difference in appearance can occur even if ENSO
indices do not have any predictability beyond
interannual time-scales. The wings around 15-20
degrees S, and sub-surface variability at many other
locations are predictable on interannual and
multi-year time-scales. This includes westward
propagating internal RWs within about 25 degrees of
the equator. The slowest of these take up to 4 years
to reach the western boundary. This sub-surface
predictability has significant oceanographic
interest. However, it is linked to only low levels
of SST variability. Consequently, extrapolation of
delayed action oscillator theory to decadal
time-scales might not be justified.},

   abstract = {Because of a lack of observations, historical
simulations of land surface conditions using land
surface models are needed for studying variability
and changes in the continental water cycle and for
providing initial conditions for seasonal climate
predictions. Atmospheric forcing datasets are also
needed for land surface model development. The
quality of atmospheric forcing data greatly affects
the ability of land surface models to realistically
simulate land surface conditions. Here a carefully
constructed global forcing dataset for 1948-2004
with 3-hourly and T62 (similar to 1.875 degrees)
resolution is described, and historical simulations
using the latest version of the Community Land Model
version 3.0 (CLM3) are evaluated using available
observations of streamflow, continental freshwater
discharge, surface runoff, and soil moisture. The
forcing dataset was derived by combining
observation-based analyses of monthly precipitation
and surface air temperature with intramonthly
variations from the National Centers for
Environmental Prediction-National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis, which
is shown to have spurious trends and biases in
surface temperature and precipitation. Surface
downward solar radiation from the reanalysis was
first adjusted for variations and trends using
monthly station records of cloud cover anomaly and
then for mean biases using satellite observations
during recent decades. Surface specific humidity
from the reanalysis was adjusted using the adjusted
surface air temperature and reanalysis relative
humidity. Surface wind speed and air pressure were
interpolated directly from the 6-hourly reanalysis
data. Sensitivity experiments show that the
precipitation adjustment (to the reanalysis data)
leads to the largest improvement, while the
temperature and radiation adjustments have only
small effects. When forced by this dataset, the CLM3
reproduces many aspects of the long-term mean,
annual cycle, interannual and decadal variations,
and trends of streamflow for many large rivers
(e.g., the Orinoco, Changjiang, Mississippi, etc.),
although substantial biases exist. The simulated
long-term-mean freshwater discharge into the global
and individual oceans is comparable to 921
river-based observational estimates. Observed soil
moisture variations over Illinois and parts of
Eurasia are generally simulated well, with the
dominant influence coming from precipitation. The
results suggest that the CLM3 simulations are useful
for climate change analysis. It is also shown that
unrealistically low intensity and high frequency of
precipitation, as in most model-simulated
precipitation or observed time-averaged fields,
result in too much evaporation and too little
runoff, which leads to lower than observed river
flows. This problem can be reduced by adjusting the
precipitation rates using observed-precipitation
frequency maps.},

Murray Darling Basin (MDB), responsible for much of
Australia's agricultural output, have experienced a
severe drought (termed the "Big Dry'') with record
high temperatures and record low inflow. We find
that during the Big Dry the sensitivity of soil
moisture to rainfall decline is over 80% higher
than during the World War II drought from
1937-1945. A relationship exists between soil
moisture and temperature independent of rainfall,
particularly in austral spring and summer. Annually,
a rise of 1 degrees C leads to a 9% reduction in
soil moisture over the southern MDB, contributing to
the recent high sensitivity. Since 1950, the impact
from rising temperature contributes to 45% of the
total soil moisture reduction. In a warming climate,
as the same process also leads to an inflow
reduction, the reduced water availability can only
be mitigated by increased rainfall. Other

discussed. Citation: Cai, W., T. Cowan, P. Briggs,

climatic processes are intimately coupled, so that
understanding variability at any one timescale

following a power-law scaling(1-7). But although
specific modes of interannual variability are
relatively well understood(8,9), the general
controls on continuum variability are uncertain and
usually described as purely stochastic
processes(10-13). Here we show that power-law
relationships of surface temperature variability
scale with annual and Milankovitch-period (23,000-

corresponds to scaling at monthly to decadal
periods, while millennial and longer periods are
tied to the Milankovitch cycles. Thus the annual,
Milankovitch and continuum temperature variability
together represent the response to deterministic
insolation forcing. The identification of a
deterministic control on the continuum provides

transports of both latent and dry static energy
reinforce one another. However, the results
highlight strong cancellations between the
transports of latent and dry static energy in the
Tropics as moisture is converted into latent heat,
and also between quasi-stationary and transient
components in the extratropics. Hence the total
energy transports and divergences are fairly
seamless with latitude and the total interannual

between them, as the stationary waves determine the

transient disturbances help maintain the stationary
waves. These results highlight that observationally
there is a very strong constraint that the global

a large jump in the early 1980s due to an

expansion primarily due to surface warming, while

   abstract = {Seasonal movements of the Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ITCZ) control precipitation patterns and cloud
cover throughout the tropics. In this study we have
reconstructed seasonal and interannual variability
of the eastern Pacific ITCZ from 1984 to 1707 using
subseasonal deltaO-18 analyses on a massive coral
from Secas Island (7-degrees 59'N, 82-degrees 3'W)
in the Gulf of Chiriqui, Panama'. The land area that
drains into the Gulf of Chiriqui has served to
amplify the rainfall effect on nearshore surface
waters and coral deltaO-18 composition. During the
protracted wet season in Panama, the deltaO-18 of
precipitation (deltaO-18ppt) is reduced on average
by 10 parts per thousand and sea surface salinity
(SSS) along the western coast is reduced up to 11
parts per thousand. Calibration of the coral
deltaO-18 from Secas Island against instrumental sea
surface temperature (SST), SSS, precipitation and
deltaO-18(ppt) data indicate that seasonal rainfall
induced variations in seawater deltaO-18 are
responsible for approximately 80% of the annual
deltaO-18 variance. Past El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) events are recorded as minor 0.2
to 0.4 parts per thousand deltaO-18 changes
superimposed on the dominant annual
deltaO-18seawater and salinity variations. The
annual cycle in coral deltaO-18 (average 0.9 parts
per thousand) accounts for the largest component of
variance at 51% and is the direct result of the
annual northward expansion of the eastern Pacific
ITCZ. The regularity of the reconstructed seasonal
ITCZ cycle indicates that over the length of the
record the zone of maximum rainfall in the eastern
Pacific has always expanded north to at least Panama
in every northern hemisphere summer. Significant
interannual and interdecadal deltaO-18 oscillations
occur at average periods near 9, 3-7 (ENSO band), 17
and 33 years (listed in order of decreasing
variance). Over the past 20 years similar decadal
shifts are apparent in coral deltaO-18 from
nearshore in the Gulf of Panama. SST data spanning
the last 40 years show no decadal changes. This
indicates that decadal oscillations in the Gulf of
Chiriqui deltaO-18 record are regional features not
related to SST changes, but are caused by ITCZ
precipitation effects on the deltaO-18 of
seawater. A 9-year period in Panama precipitation
supports this conclusion and provides a potential
link between interannual coral deltaO-18 variations
and ITCZ precipitation. It is also shown that the
period of the average 9-year interannual period in
coral deltaO-18 varies from approximately 7.5 years
to approximately 11.8 years. Variance near 11 years
is strongest throughout the 1800s, however, a poor
direct correlation with sunspot number and solar
irradiance leaves the origin of this interannual
oscillation in question. The deltaO-18 time series
also contains a long-term trend of -0.40 parts per
thousand suggesting an increase in precipitation
and/or SST since the early 1800s. As the Gulf of
Chiriqui coral deltaO-18 time series is the first
paleoclimatic record of past variations in the ITCZ,
other seasonal-resolution reconstructions of the
past behavior of the ITCZ are required to test
whether the interannual and long-term variability
observed in the eastern Pacific ITCZ is more than
regional in scale.},

   abstract = {Climate change impact studies for water resource
applications, such as the development of projections
of reservoir yields or the assessment of likely
frequency and amplitude of drought under a future
climate, require that the year-to-year persistence
in a range of hydrological variables such as
catchment average rainfall be properly
represented. This persistence is often attributable
to low-frequency variability in the global sea
surface temperature (SST) field and other
large-scale climate variables through a complex
sequence of teleconnections. To evaluate the
capacity of general circulation models (GCMs) to
accurately represent this low-frequency variability,
a set of wavelet-based skill measures has been
developed to compare GCM performance in representing
interannual variability with the observed global SST
data, as well as to assess the extent to which this
variability is imparted in precipitation and surface
pressure anomaly fields. A validation of the derived
skill measures is performed using GCM precipitation
as an input in a reservoir storage context, with the
accuracy of reservoir storage estimates shown to be
improved by using GCM outputs that correctly
represent the observed low-frequency variability.
Significant differences in the performance of
different GCMs is demonstrated, suggesting that
judicious selection of models is required if the
climate impact assessment is sensitive to
low-frequency variability. The two GCMs that were
found to exhibit the most appropriate representation
of global low-frequency variability for individual
variables assessed were the Istituto Nazionale di
Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) ECHAM4 and
L'Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace Coupled Model,
version 4 (IPSL CM4); when considering all three
variables, the Max Planck Institute (MPI) ECHAM5
performed well. Importantly, models that represented
interannual variability well for SST also performed
well for the other two variables, while models that
performed poorly for SST also had consistently low
skill across the remaining variables.},

important role in determining long-term fire

occurrence between the two sites with the largest
difference in effective precipitation suggests that
centennial-scale shifts in climate may have overcome
the environmental differences between these

   abstract = {The easterly Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) is a
prominent climate feature over the Intra-America
Seas, and it is associated with much of the water
vapor transport from the tropical Atlantic into the
Caribbean Basin. In this study, the North American
Regional Reanalysis (NARR) is analyzed to improve
the understanding of the dynamics of the CLLJ and
its relationship to regional rainfall
variations. Horizontal momentum balances are
examined to understand how jet variations on both
diurnal and seasonal time scales are controlled. The
jet is geostrophic to the first order. Its
previously documented semidiurnal cycle (with minima
at about 0400 and 1600 LT) is caused by semidiurnal
cycling of the meridional geopotential height
gradient in association with changes in the westward
extension of the North Atlantic subtropical high
(NASH). A diurnal cycle is superimposed, associated
with a meridional land-sea breeze (solenoidal
circulation) onto the north coast of South America,
so that the weakest jet velocities occur at 1600
LT. The CLLJ is present throughout the year, and it
is known to vary in strength semiannually. Peak
magnitudes in July are related to the seasonal cycle
of the NASH, and a second maximum in February is
caused by heating over northern South America. From
May through September, zonal geopotential gradients
associated with summer heating over Central America
and Mexico induce meridional flow. The CLLJ splits
into two branches, including a southerly branch that
connects with the Great Plains low-level jet (GPLLJ)
bringing moisture into the central United
States. During the rest of the year, the flow
remains essentially zonal across the Caribbean Basin
and into the Pacific. A strong (weak) CLLJ is
associated with reduced (enhanced) rainfall over the
Caribbean Sea throughout the year in the NARR. The
relationship with precipitation over land depends on
the season. Despite the fact that the southerly
branch of the CLLJ feeds into the meridional GPLLJ
in May through September, variations in the CLLJ
strength during these months do not impact
U.S. precipitation, because the CLLJ strength is
varying in response to regional-scale forcing and
not to changes in the large-scale
circulation. During the cool season, there are
statistically significant correlations between the
CLLJ index and rainfall over the United States. When
the CLLJ is strong, there is anomalous northward
moisture transport across the Gulf of Mexico into
the central United States and pronounced rainfall
increases over Louisiana and Texas. A weak jet is
associated with anomalous westerly flow across the
southern Caribbean region and significantly reduced
rainfall over the south-central United States. No
connection between the intensity of the CLLJ and
drought over the central United States is
found. There are only three drought summers in the
NARR period (1980, 1988, and 2006), and the CLLJ was
extremely weak in 1988 but not in 1980 or 2006.},

   abstract = {Fluctuations in spring climate in the western United
States over the last 4-5 decades are described by
examining changes in the blooming of plants and the
timing of snowmelt-runoff pulses. The two measures
of spring's onset that are employed are the timing
of first bloom of lilac and honeysuckle bushes from
a long-term cooperative phenological network, and
the timing of the first major pulse of snowmelt
recorded from high-elevation streams. Both measures
contain year-to-year fluctuations, with typical
year-to year fluctuations at a given site of one to
three weeks. These fluctuations are spatially
coherent, forming regional patterns that cover most
of the west. Fluctuations in lilac first bloom dates
are highly correlated to those of honeysuckle, and
both are significantly correlated with those of the
spring snowmelt pulse. Each of these measures, then,
probably respond to a common mechanism. Various
analyses indicate that anomalous temperature exerts
the greatest influence upon both interannual and
secular changes in the onset of spring in these
networks. Earlier spring onsets since the late 1970s
are a remarkable feature of the records, and reflect
the unusual spell of warmer-than-normal springs in
western North America during this period. The warm
episodes are clearly related to larger-scale
atmospheric conditions across North America and the
North Pacific, but whether this is predominantly an
expression of natural variability or also a symptom
of global warming is not certain.},

larger multicentennial variability than most

agrees well with temperatures reconstructed from
borehole measurements(12) and with temperatures
obtained with a general circulation

temperatures - similar to those observed in the
twentieth century before 1990 occurred around AD
1000 to 1100, and minimum temperatures that are
about 0.7K below the average of 1961 - 90 occurred

transform (MWT), is developed to generalize the
classical mean-eddy decomposition (MED) in fluid
mechanics to include three or more ranges of scales,
and to ensure a faithful representation of localized
energy processes. The development begins with the
introduction of a sequence of finite-dimensional
subspaces of L-2[0, 1], \{V-rho,V- j\}(0 <= j <= j2),
based on a multiresolution analysis of L-2(R). All
the V(rho,j2)are sampling spaces, i. e., spaces
spanned by some translation invariant basis. The
upper bound of the index of scale level, j(2), is
prescribed in accordance with the signal of
concern. Within V-rho,V-j2, the concepts of
largescale, mesoscale, and submesoscale windows are
introduced, each being a subspace of V-rho,V-j2 and
containing exclusively a range of scales. A
transform- reconstruction pair is constructed on
each window, representing the features for the
corresponding range of scales. The resulting MWT has
several useful properties. Of particular importance
is a property of marginalization, which allows for a
simple representation of energy on speci. ed windows
and localizations. The MWT has been connected to
other existing analysis techniques: The classical
MED turns out to be a particular case, with
averaging acting as both a transform and a
reconstruction in the MWT framework; it has also
been compared with wavelet analysis and the Hilbert

MWT is built with an orthonormalized cubic spline
system. Computational techniques leading to a fast

validated with two examples, and its applications in
the study of hydrodynamic stability analysis (fully

Georgia Giant column in Carlsbad Cavern provides

alpha spectrometric U-series ages determined at
intervals of similar to 7.6 cm along the core
indicate five periods of deposition and five
hiatuses, the longest from 136 to 110 ka. Variations
in growth rate (0 to 70 mm/ka), in the abundance of
aragonite, chalcedony, and Fe-bearing phases, and in
C-13 indicate that glacial intervals of the last 164
ka, OIS 6, 4, and 2, were much wetter than today, as
were the colder substages 5d and 5b of OIS 5. By
contrast, during the two warmest periods of the past
164 ka, namely OIS 5e and 1, there was no deposition
on either side of the speleothem, suggesting
conditions as dry or drier than today. The record
from Carlsbad parallels data from many other sites
in the southwestern USA and northern Mexico, and
data from marine sediments and ice cores,
demonstrating the extent to which ice sheet
fluctuations influenced conditions in southern New
Mexico. Detailed correlation of delta C-13 values in
the Georgia Giant, which range from -6.6 to +0.9
parts per thousand relative to PDB, with distant
speleothem records and with data from ice cores,
further documents the linkage of southwestern
climate with global-scale extent of glaciation.
Values of delta O-18 in the Georgia Giant core range
from -9.7 to -4.7 parts per thousand relative to PDB
and average -6.6 parts per thousand. O-18-depleted
carbonate in the Georgia Giant during OIS 6, at a
time when the world's oceans were enriched in O-18,
suggests that precipitation during cold intervals
was brought largely by Pacific air masses in fall,
winter and spring as a result of the southward
displacement of the polar jet stream by the growth
of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Termination II,
marking the end of the penultimate glaciation, is
well defined in the core's delta O-18
data. Analytical uncertainties in the radiometric
ages do not preclude a start of Termination 11 as
late as 128 ka, as suggested by SPECMAP
data. However, data from the Georgia Giant core are
more compatible with an earlier start like that
obtained from Devils Hole and Vostok data, raising
the possibility that early warming was widespread in
the U.S. southwest region by 145 ka. (c) 2006

forcing due to volcanic aerosols is
reassessed. Building on the work of Mann et al.,
estimates of volcanic forcing over the past
millennium and a climate model of intermediate
complexity are used to draw a diagram of El Ni (n)
over tildeo likelihood as a function of the
intensity of volcanic forcing. It is shown that in
the context of this model, only eruptions larger
than that of Mt. Pinatubo ( 1991, peak dimming of
about 3.7Wm(-2)) can shift the likelihood and
amplitude of an El Ni (n) over tildeo event above
the level of the model's internal
variability. Explosive volcanism cannot be said to
trigger El Ni (n) over tildeo events per se, but it
is found to raise their likelihood by 50% on
average, also favoring higher amplitudes. This
reconciles, on one hand, the demonstration by Adams
et al. of a statistical relationship between
explosive volcanism and El Ni (n) over tildeo and,
on the other hand, the ability to predict El Ni (n)
over tildeo events of the last 148 yr without
knowledge of volcanic forcing. The authors then
focus on the strongest eruption of the millennium
(A. D. 1258), and show that it is likely to have
favored the occurrence of a moderate-to-strong El Ni
(n) over tildeo event in the midst of prevailing La
Ni (n) over tildea-like conditions induced by
increased solar activity during the well-documented
Medieval Climate Anomaly. Compiling paleoclimate

important hydroclimatic consequences for neighboring

particular, that the event briefly interrupted a

northern Texas. The development of Blas appeared to
be favored as an easterly wave moved into the
eastern Pacific during the active phase of a
Madden-Julian oscillation. On the regional scale,
sounding data reveal a prominent sea breeze along
the east shore of the Gulf of California, with a
deep return flow as a consequence of the elevated
Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) immediately to the
east. Subsidence produced a dry layer over the gulf,
whereas a deep moist layer existed over the west
slopes of the SMO. A prominent nocturnal low-level
jet was present on most days over the northern
gulf. The diurnal cycle of heating and moistening
(Q1 and Q2) over the SMO was characterized by deep
convective profiles in the mid- to upper troposphere
at 1800 LT, followed by stratiform-like profiles at
midnight, consistent with the observed diurnal
evolution of precipitation over this coastal
mountainous region. The analyses in the core NAME
domain are based on a gridded dataset derived from
atmospheric soundings only and, therefore, should
prove useful in validating reanalyses and regional
models.},

   abstract = {Decadal time scale climate variability in the North
Pacific has implications for climate both locally
and over North America. A crucial question is the
degree to which this variability arises from coupled
ocean/atmosphere interactions over the North Pacific
that involve ocean dynamics, as opposed to either
purely thermodynamic effects of the oceanic mixed
layer integrating in situ the stochastic atmospheric
forcing, or the teleconnected response to tropical
variability. The part of the variability that is
coming from local coupled ocean/atmosphere
interactions involving ocean dynamics is potentially
predictable by an ocean/atmosphere general
circulation model (O/A GCM), and such predictions
could (depending on the achievable lead time) have
distinct societal benefits. This question is
examined using the results of fully coupled O/A
GCMs, as well as targeted numerical experiments with
stand-alone ocean and atmosphere models
individually. It is found that coupled
ocean/atmosphere interactions that involve ocean
dynamics are important to determining the strength
and frequency of a decadal-time scale peak in the
spectra of several oceanic variables in the Kuroshio
extension region off Japan. Local stochastic
atmospheric heat nux forcing, integrated by the
oceanic mixed layer into a red spectrum, provides a
noise background from which the signal must be
extracted. Although teleconnected ENSO responses
influence the North Pacific in the 2-7 years/cycle
frequency band, it is shown that some decadal-time
scale processes in the North Pacific proceed without
ENSO. Likewise, although the effects of stochastic
atmospheric forcing on ocean dynamics are
discernible, a feedback path from the ocean to the
atmosphere is suggested by the results.},

   abstract = {It is argued from SST observations for the period
1950-90 that the tropical Indo-Pacific
ocean-atmosphere system may be described as a stable
linear dynamical system driven by spatially coherent
Gaussian white noise. Evidence is presented that the
predictable component of SST anomaly growth is
associated with the constructive interference of
several damped normal modes after an optimal initial
structure is set up by the white noise forcing. In
particular, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
growth is associated with an interplay of at least
three damped normal modes, with periods longer than
two years and decay times of 4 to 8 months, rather
than the manifestation of a single unstable mode
whose growth is arrested by
nonlinearities. Interestingly, the relevant modes
are; not the three least damped modes of the
system. Rather, mode selection, and the
establishment of the optimal initial structure from
which growth occurs, are controlled by the
stochastic forcing. Experiments conducted with an
empirical stochastic-dynamical model show that
stochastic forcing not only adds energy to the
system, but also plays a role in setting up the
optimal structure. It is shown that growth from
modal interference can occur for as long as 18
months, which within the confines of this model
defines a predictability limit for growth
events. Growth associated with the stochastic
forcing is also possible, but is unpredictable. The
timescale on which the predictable and unpredictable
components of SST growth become comparable to each
other gives a more conservative predictability limit
of 15 months. The above scenario is based on
empirical evidence obtained from SST anomalies
alone. From the results of several tests based on
statistical properties of linear and nonlinear
dynamical systems, one may conclude that much of the
ENSO cycle in nature is dominated by stable, forced
dynamics.},

   abstract = {Severe drought is arguably one of the greatest
recurring natural disasters that strikes North
America. A synthesis of multiproxy data shows that
North America was in the grip of a severe
centennial-scale drought during medieval times
(800-1300 AD). In this study, the Community
Atmospheric Model ( CAM) is used to investigate the
role of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from
the North Atlantic and the tropical Pacific Ocean on
this megadrought. These anomalies are obtained from
proxy reconstructions of SST. Four model experiments
with prescribed SST anomalies in the tropical
Pacific and/or North Atlantic Ocean were made. The
CAM results captured the major dry features that
occurred during medieval times in North America. The
cold tropical Pacific alone can simulate essentially
the drought intensity, while the warm North Atlantic
alone can simulate the drought areal extent. The two
working together can explain the severity and
longevity of the drought. During the spring season,
the cool tropical Pacific, or the warm North
Atlantic, or both, results in less moisture
transport to the High Plains, with a 15-40%
decrease in rainfall. The importance of the Atlantic
Ocean on medieval drought in North America suggests
that attention should be paid not only to the
tropical Pacific Ocean but also to the North
Atlantic Ocean in understanding the North America
drought variability and predictability, both at
present and during the past. This is especially true
because the Pacific Ocean SST anomalies in medieval
times as recorded by proxy data are somewhat
controversial, while the North Atlantic anomalies
seem more certain.},

changes in the northern annular mode of climate
variability, although the land phase shift is
significantly larger than that predicted by trends
in the northern annular mode alone. Few of the

   abstract = {We measured stable oxygen isotope ratios and
skeletal growth rates in the massive corals Pavona
clavus and P. gigantea from the west coast of
Isabela Island, Galapagos, to assess interannual to
decadal climate variability in the eastern
Pacific. Comparisons of instrumental data sets show
that sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Galapagos
region are representative of a broad portion of the
eastern equatorial Pacific. The site is especially
well-suited for long-term studies of the El
Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, as it
lies within the eastern Pacific ''center of action''
for thermal anomalies associated with ENSO. The
P. gigantea isotope record is nearly monthly in
resolution, spans the period 1961-1982, and shows
strong correlation with a Galapagos instrumental SST
record (r = -0.90 for annual
averages). Cross-spectral analysis shows that SST
can explain greater than 80% of the variance in
deltaO-18 at both the annual cycle and within the
high-frequency portion of the ENSO band (3-5
years). The P. clavus record is annual in
resolution, extends from 1587 to 1953 A.D., and was
obtained from a 10-m diameter colony preserved
within the Urvina Bay uplift. Because seawater
deltaO-18 variations in the region are very small,
we interpret the Urvina Bay coral deltaO-18 record
in terms of annual average SST. The isotopic record
appears to be a very good, but not perfect,
indicator of ENSO events and shows good
correspondence with the historical ENSO
reconstruction of Quinn et al. (1987). A number of
low deltaO-18 excursions that we observe during the
17th and 18th centuries very likely represent ENSO
events that are missing from the historical
tabulations. Most interannual deltaO-18 variations
between 1607 and 1953 A.D. represent annual average
temperature excursions of 1-degrees to
2.5-degrees-C. During the Little Ice Age, the annual
deltaO-18 series correlates well with many North
American tree ring records and shows low
temperatures during the early 1600s and early 1800s,
and relatively warmer conditions during the
1700s. Unlike most northern hemisphere tree ring and
instrumental records, we see no evidence at this
site for warming between 1880 and 1940 but rather
observe a slight cooling (<1-degrees-C). Oscillatory
modes within the ENSO frequency band dominate the
347-year deltaO-18 time series, accounting for >28%
of the total variance. The main ENSO mode is
centered at 4.6 years and accounts for 12% of the
total variance. Additional significant oscillations
occur at periods of 3.3, 6, 8, 11, 17, 22, and 34
years. Both annual growth rate and deltaO-18 show
variance at periods equivalent to the solar and
solar magnetic periods (e.g., 11 and 22 years,
respectively). In addition, the amplitude of the
11-year deltaO-18 cycle generally varies with the
amplitude of the solar cycle, supporting previous
suggestions that the solar cycle may modulate
interannual to decadal climate variability in the
tropics. The dominant oscillatory modes, both within
the ENSO and interdecadal frequency bands, shift to
shorter periods from the early to middle 1700s and
again from the middle to late 1800s. This may
reflect major reorganizations within the tropical
ocean-atmosphere system and suggests that tropical
Pacific climate variability is linked across
timescales ranging from years to decades.},

record of rainfall, evaporation, streamflow, and

this does not adequately address the potential risks

decades. There is also serious concern about how
anthropogenic climate change may exacerbate drought

severity of droughts are analyzed during a range of
"climate states'' (e.g., different phases of the
Pacific, Indian, and/or Southern Oceans) to
demonstrate that drought risk varies markedly over
interannual through to multidecadal time
scales. Importantly, by accounting for climate
variability and change on multitemporal scales
(e.g., interdecadal, multidecadal, and the palaeo
scale), it is demonstrated that the risk of failure
of current drought management practices may be
better assessed and more robust climate adaptation

this gradient the average minimum temperatures of

annual variation in temperature, increase from -10

deciduous to leaf-exchanging or evergreen in the

break can be reliably predicted for the week in
which mean minimum temperature rises to 7 degrees
C. Temperature-dependent deciduous phenology-and
hence the validity of temperature-driven phenology
models-terminates in southern North America near 30
degrees N, where T (Jan)> 7 degrees C enables growth
of tropical trees and cultivation of frost-sensitive
citrus fruits. In tropical climates most temperate
broad-leaved species exchange old for new leaves
within a few weeks in January-February, i.e., their
phenology becomes similar to that of tropical
leaf-exchanging species. Leaf buds of the southern
ecotypes of these temperate species are therefore
not winter-dormant and have no chilling
requirement. As in many tropical trees, bud break of
Celtis, Quercus and Fagus growing in warm climates
is induced in early spring by increasing
daylength. In tropical climates vegetative phenology
is determined mainly by leaf longevity, seasonal
variation in water stress and day length. As water
stress during the dry season varies widely with soil
water storage, climate-driven models cannot predict
tree phenology in the tropics and tropical tree
phenology does not constitute a useful indicator of

of HadCM3LC is used to assess the role of simulated
changes in mid-twenty-first century sea surface

When the full HadCM3LC SST anomalies (SSTAs) are
used, the atmosphere model reproduces the Amazon
Basin climate change exhibited by HadCM3LC,
including much of the reduction in Amazon Basin
rainfall. This rainfall change is shown to be the
combined effect of SSTAs in both the tropical
Atlantic and the Pacific, with roughly equal
contributions from each basin. The greatest rainfall
reduction occurs from May to October, outside of the
mature South American monsoon (SAM) season. This dry
season response is the combined effect of a more
rapid warming of the tropical North Atlantic
relative to the south, and warm SSTAs in the
tropical east Pacific. Conversely, a weak
enhancement of mature SAM season rainfall in
response to Atlantic SST change is suppressed by the
atmospheric response to Pacific SST. This net wet
season response is sufficient to prevent dry season
soil moisture deficits from being recharged through
the SAM season, leading to a perennial soil moisture
reduction and an associated 30% reduction in annual
Amazon Basin net primary productivity (NPP). A
further 23% NPP reduction occurs in response to a
3.5 degrees C warmer air temperature associated with
a global mean SST warming.},

   abstract = {Here the 1976-77 climate regime shift that was
accompanied by a remarkable change in the lead-lag
relationships between Indian Ocean sea surface
temperature (SST) and El Ni (n) over tildeo
evolution is shown. After the 1976-77 regime shift,
a correlation analysis suggests that southern Indian
Ocean SSTs observed during late boreal winter are a
key precursor in predicting El Ni (n) over tildeo
evolution as the traditional oceanic heat content
anomalies in the equatorial Pacific or zonal wind
anomalies over the equatorial western Pacific. The
possible physical mechanisms underlying this highly
significant statistical relationship are
discussed. After the 1976-77 regime shift, southern
Indian Ocean SST anomalies produced by Mascarene
high pulses during boreal winter trigger coupled
air-sea processes in the tropical eastern Indian
Ocean during the following seasons. This produces a
persistent remote forcing on the Pacific climate
system, promoting wind anomalies over the western
equatorial Pacific and modulating the regional
Hadley cell in the southwest Pacific. These
modulations, in turn, excite Rossby waves, which
produce quasi-stationary circulation anomalies in
the extratropical South Pacific, responsible for the
development of the southern branch of the ''
horseshoe '' El Nino pattern. The change of the
background SST state that occurred in the late 1970s
over the Indian Ocean may also explain why ENSO
evolution is different before and after the 1976-77
regime shift. These results shed some light on the
possible influence of global warming or decadal
fluctuations on El Nino evolution through changes in
teleconnection patterns between the Indian and
Pacific Oceans.},

   abstract = {To assess climate sensitivity from Earth radiation
observations of limited duration and observed sea
surface temperatures (SSTs) requires a closed and
therefore global domain, equilibrium between the
fields, and robust methods of dealing with
noise. Noise arises from natural variability in the
atmosphere and observational noise in precessing
satellite observations. This paper explores the
meaning of results that use only the tropical
region. We compute correlations and regressions
between tropical SSTs and top of-atmosphere (TOA)
longwave, shortwave and net radiation using a
variety of methods to test robustness of
results. The main changes in SSTs throughout the
tropics are associated with El Nino Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) events in which the dominant
changes in energy into an atmospheric column come
from ocean heat exchange through evaporation, latent
heat release in precipitation, and redistribution of
that heat through atmospheric winds. These changes
can be an order of magnitude larger than the net TOA
radiation changes, and their effects are
teleconnected globally, and especially into the
subtropics. Atmospheric model results are explored
and found to be consistent with observations. From
1985 to 1999 the largest perturbation in TOA
radiative fluxes was from the eruption of Mount
Pinatubo and clearly models which do not include
that forcing will not simulate the
effects. Consequently, regressions of radiation with
SSTs in the tropics may have nothing to say about
climate sensitivity. Citation: Trenberth, K. E.,

United States have dominantly retreated since the
end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the nineteenth
century, although average rates of retreat varied
from strong in the first-half of the twentieth
century, with glaciers stabilizing or even advancing
until 1980, and then resuming consistent
recession. This retreat has been accompanied by
statistically detectable declines in late-summer
streamflow from glacier-fed catchments over much of
the Study area, although there is some geographical
variation: over recent decades, glaciers in
northwest BC and southwest Yukon have lost mass
dominantly by thinning with relatively low rates of
terminal retreat, and glacier-fed streams in that
region have experienced increasing flows. In many
valleys, glacier retreat has produced geomorphic
hazards, including outburst floods from
moraine-dammed lakes, mass failures from
oversteepened valley walls and debris flows
generated on moraines. In addition to these
hydrologic and geomorphic changes, evidence is
presented that glacier retreat will result in higher
stream temperatures, possibly transient increases in
suspended sediment fluxes and concentrations, and
changes in water chemistry. With climate projected
to continue warming over the twenty-first century,
current trends in hydrology, geomorphology and water
quality should continue, with a range of
implications for water resources availability and

Over the tropics, the accuracy of all reanalyses is much less than over the midlatitudes.

   abstract = {We reconstructed the late-Holocene surface-moisture
history and vegetation dynamics of a raised bog in
Michigan using testate amoebae, peat humification,
pollen, stomata and plant macrofossils. Our primary
objective was to compare bog palaeohydrology with
the water-level history of Lake Michigan, and to
regional and local vegetation changes. Hydrologic
histories inferred from testate amoebae and
humification show similar trends, and correspond
with records of past water-level variability in Lake
Michigan. The bog clearly shows effective-moisture
increases during the Algoma highstand (similar
to3200-2300 cal. BP) and a later unnamed highstand
(similar to1900-1300 cal. BP). Some higher-frequency
fluctuations are also similar. The good
correspondence indicates that bog hydrology and the
water levels of Lake Michigan have been driven by
changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation
patterns for at least the past 3500 years. Climate
during the Algoma highstand may have been
spatiotemporally complex, with increasing moisture
occurring several hundred years earlier in the
northern portion of the western Great Lakes
basin. Locally, the expansion and contraction of
Picea populations on the bog surface was probably
directly related to moisture conditions. The
well-documented decline in Fagus populations in the
central Great Lakes region after 1000 cal. BP is
contemporaneous with a major shift towards drier
conditions, suggesting that relative dryness caused
the decline.},

important implications for subtropical societies and

large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as
jet streams and storm tracks, could result in shifts
in precipitation patterns affecting natural

implications of the expansion for stratospheric
circulation and the distribution of ozone in the

climate model projections of expansion over the

   abstract = {We discuss 3D global simulations of the early martian climate that we have performed assuming a faint young Sun and denser CO2 atmosphere. We include a self-consistent representation of the water cycle, with atmosphere–surface interactions, atmospheric transport, and the radiative effects of CO2 and H2O gas and clouds taken into account. We find that for atmospheric pressures greater than a fraction of a bar, the adiabatic cooling effect causes temperatures in the southern highland valley network regions to fall significantly below the global average. Long-term climate evolution simulations indicate that in these circumstances, water ice is transported to the highlands from low-lying regions for a wide range of orbital obliquities, regardless of the extent of the Tharsis bulge. In addition, an extended water ice cap forms on the southern pole, approximately corresponding to the location of the Noachian/Hesperian era Dorsa Argentea Formation. Even for a multiple-bar CO2 atmosphere, conditions are too cold to allow long-term surface liquid water. Limited melting occurs on warm summer days in some locations, but only for surface albedo and thermal inertia conditions that may be unrealistic for water ice. Nonetheless, meteorite impacts and volcanism could potentially cause intense episodic melting under such conditions. Because ice migration to higher altitudes is a robust mechanism for recharging highland water sources after such events, we suggest that this globally sub-zero, ‘icy highlands’ scenario for the late Noachian climate may be sufficient to explain most of the fluvial geology without the need to invoke additional long-term warming mechanisms or an early warm, wet Mars.},

+5.6 W m\&\{\#\}8722;2), a lofted latent heating, and
a reduced diurnal temperature difference, all of
which could potentially impact regional circulation

   abstract = {The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a
climate-forcing mechanism that has been shown to
affect precipitation and the occurrence of wildfires
in many parts of the world. In the southern United
States and northern Mexico, warm events (El Nino)
are associated with moist winter conditions and
fewer fires, while cool events (La Nina) tend to
favor dry winters and more fires. We tested this
relationship in a region of northeastern Mexico by
characterizing the historical fire regime and
climatic influences. Fire regimes were reconstructed
from fire-scar samples collected from 100 trees in
three high-elevation sites on Pena Nevada in
southern Nuevo Leon. The sites were similar to 25 ha
each, and the site centers were similar to 1 km
apart. The earliest recorded fire occurred in 1521
and the time period we used for analysis was
1645-1929. The sites were characterized by frequent
surface fires before the 1920s. In the three sites,
mean fire intervals ranged from 8.6 to 9.6 years
(all fires) and 11.9 to 18.6 years (fires that
scarred >= 25% of recording trees). The per-tree
mean fire return interval was 17 years, and all
three sites burned in the same year seven times
between 1774 and 1929. After 1929, fires were nearly
eliminated in all sites, likely due to human
causes. We found a temporal change in the
association between ENSO events and fires; before
the 1830s La Nina events were significantly
associated with fire years, while after the 1830s
this association was not significant. In 1998, when
the most severe El Nino event of the past century
occurred, the three sites experienced severe,
stand-replacing fires that killed many trees that
had survived multiple surface fires in the
past. Prior to the 1830s, fires tended to occur
during dry La Nina years, but since then both La
Nina and El Nino have been associated with dry years
in this region, especially during the last three
decades. This result suggests that ENSO effects have
changed over time in this location and that phases
of ENSO are not consistent indicators of
precipitation, fire occurrence, or fire behavior in
this area of northeastern Mexico.},

This variation is dominated by the seasonal changes over the Antarctic Ocean where the second (semiannual) harmonic of the mid-tropospheric meridional temperature gradient has a magnitude exceeding that of the first (annual) harmonic. The existence of the marked semiannual component in this region is shown to be a consequence of the difference between the heating and cooling rates in different latitudes where the mid-tropospheric annual temperature ranges are similar. In latitude 50S cooling in autumn is rapid compared with the warming in spring, the reverse being true at latitude 65S. This behavior is related to the heat budget of the oceanic upper layers.

climate change has been symmetric about the equator,
the causes of hemispherically symmetric variability
in the recent observational record are examined
using the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction - National Center for Atmospheric
Research reanalysis dataset and numerical models. It
was found that the dominant cause of hemispherically
symmetric variability is the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation. During an El Nino event the Tropics
warm at all longitudes and the subtropical jets in
both hemispheres strengthen on their equatorward
flanks. Poleward of the tropical warming there are
latitude belts of marked cooling, extending from the
surface to the tropopause in both hemispheres, at
all longitudes and in all seasons. The midlatitude
cooling is caused by changes in the eddy-driven mean
meridional circulation. Changes in the transient
eddy momentum fluxes during an El Nino event force
upper-tropospheric ascent in midlatitudes through a
balance between the eddy fluxes and the Coriolis
torque. The eddy-driven ascent causes anomalous
adiabatic cooling, which is primarily balanced by
anomalous diabatic heating. Using a quasigeostrophic
spherical model, forced by an imposed surface eddy
disturbance of chosen wavenumber and frequency, it
is shown that the anomalous eddy momentum fluxes are
caused by the impact that the changes in the
tropically forced subtropical jets have on the
propagation in the latitude - height plane of
transient eddies. Changes in zonal winds, and
associated changes in the meridional gradient of
potential vorticity, create an anomalous region of
low meridional wavenumber in the midlatitudes that
refracts waves away both poleward and
equatorward. Tropical forcing of variability in the
eddy-driven mean meridional circulation is another
way, in addition to Rossby wave teleconnections,
whereby the Tropics can influence extratropical
climate. Unlike teleconnections this mechanism
causes climate variability that has strong zonally
and hemispherically symmetric components and
operates throughout the seasonal cycle.},

Georgia, South Carolina, and Texas and
meteorological data from nearby cooperative weather

serve as a prognostic tool, while the two cultivar

suggest the early to mid-Holocene was a period of
reduced El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
variability, with a transition to modern, increased
ENSO frequency occurring some time in the last few
thousand years. However, the nature and timing of
this shift remains uncertain due to the
discontinuous nature and/or coarse resolution of
many ENSO proxies, as well as a lack of agreement
between previously published records. A new,
continuous, climate record from El Junco Crater Lake
in the Galdpagos Islands reveals several abrupt
changes in lake level and precipitation through the
Holocene. Hydroclimatic model simulations suggest
that El Junco lake level responds sensitively to
increases in precipitation associated with El Nino
events, rising during wet El Nino events and falling
during the intervening dry periods. Grain size data
from El Junco sediment cores indicate past lake
level variability, likely associated with changing
seasonal precipitation and ENSO frequency. The grain
size data suggest increased precipitation intensity
prior to 9000+/-120 cal years BP, and after
4200+/-130 cal years BR as well as a two-step
increase in precipitation at 3200+/-160 and
2000+/-100 cal years BP. Maximum Holocene
precipitation and inferred ENSO variability occurred
between 2000+/-100 and 1500+/-70 cal years BP,
during the same period that six other independent
proxy records suggest higher ENSO frequency and
longer, stronger El Nino events. Decreasing sediment
carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios in El Junco sediments
indicate rising lake levels from the early Holocene
to present, corroborating the grain size data. The
inferred increase in precipitation at 4200+/-130 cal
years BP and at 2000 +/- 100 cal years BP coincides
with decreasing Southwest Asian and East Asian
Monsoon intensity, suggesting tropical Pacific
climate and the Asian monsoon were interconnected
systems at centennial to millennial timescales
during the Holocene. A weakening trend in the Asian
monsoon and the trend toward wetter conditions at El
Junco also coincide with a trend toward cooler and
drier conditions inferred from Cariaco Basin

The program also enables the use of other popular standardisation methods. A series of experiments is described in which the ability of simple RCS and SF RCS to recover known tree-growth forcing signals is tested. In the comparatively rare situation where many sub-fossil data are distributed over a wide time range and there is no slope in the overall common-growth forcing signal, simple RCS is satisfactory. Simple RCS produces distortion in all other examples explored here. SF RCS is superior to simple RCS and in all cases examined. SF RCS works well except when the span of starting dates of sample trees is too narrow, a situation for which a test is available. Based on the results of the tests explored here, we conclude that Signal-Free RCS should be used as the standard method of RCS processing.},

(denoted ''reanalysis'') to produce a 40-year record
of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support
of the needs of the research and climate monitoring
communities. This effort involves the recovery of
land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft,
satellite, and other data; quality controlling and
assimilating these data with a data assimilation
system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis
period 1957-96. This eliminates perceived climate
jumps associated with changes in the data
assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis
uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data
assimilation system and a database as complete as
possible. The data assimilation and the model used
are identical to the global system implemented
operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except
that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210
km). The database has been enhanced with many
sources of observations not available in real time
for operations, provided by different countries and
organizations. The system has been designed with
advanced quality control and monitoring components,
and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a
Gray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output
archives are being created to satisfy different user
needs, including a ''quick look'' CD-ROM (one per
year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields
available twice daily, as well as surface,
top-of-the atmosphere, and isentropic
fields. Reanalysis information and selected output
is also available on-line via the Internet
(http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CDROM,
containing 13 years of selected observed, daily,
monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR
Reanalysis, is included with this issue. Output
variables are classified into four classes,
depending on the degree to which they are influenced
by the observations and/or the model. For example,
''C'' variables (such as precipitation and surface
fluxes) are completely determined by the model
during the data assimilation and should be used with
caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these
variables with observations and with several
climatologies shows that they generally contain
considerable useful information. Eight-day
forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful
for predictability studies and for monitoring the
quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of
reanalysis (1957-96) should be completed in early
1997. A continuation into the future through an
identical Climate Data Assimilation System will
allow researchers to reliably compare recent
anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since
changes in the observing systems will inevitably
produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel
reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated
for the periods immediately after the introduction
of new observing systems, such as new types of
satellite data. NCEP plans currently call for an
updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system
every five years or so. The successive reanalyses
will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the
comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.},

   abstract = {The primary focus of this review is
tropical-extratropical interactions and especially
the issues involved in determining the response of
the extratropical atmosphere to tropical forcing
associated with sea surface temperature (SST)
anomalies. The review encompasses observations,
empirical studies, theory and modeling of the
extratropical teleconnections with a focus on
developments over the Tropical Oceans-Global
Atmosphere (TOGA) decade and the current state of
understanding. In the tropical atmosphere, anomalous
SSTs force anomalies in convection and large-scale
overturning with subsidence in the descending branch
of the local Hadley circulation. The resulting
strong upper tropospheric divergence in the tropics
and convergence in the subtropics act as a Rossby
wave source. The climatological stationary planetary
waves and associated jet streams, especially in the
northern hemisphere, can make the total Rossby wave
sources somewhat insensitive to the position of the
tropical heating that induces them and thus can
create preferred teleconnection response patterns,
such as the Pacific-North American (PNA)
pattern. However, a number of factors influence the
dispersion and propagation of Rossby waves through
the atmosphere, including zonal asymmetries in the
climatological state, transients, and baroclinic and
nonlinear effects. Internal midlatitude sources can
amplify perturbations. Observations, modeling, and
theory have clearly shown how storm tracks change in
response to changes in quasi-stationary waves and
how these changes generally feedback to.maintain or
strengthen the dominant perturbations through
vorticity and momentum transports. The response of
the extratropical atmosphere naturally induces
changes in the underlying surface, so that there are
changes in extratropical SSTs and changes in land
surface hydrology and moisture availability that can
feedback and influence the total response. Land
surface processes are believed to be especially
important in spring and summer. Anomalous SSTs and
tropical forcing have tended to be strongest in the
northern winter, and teleconnections in the southern
hemisphere are weaker and more variable and thus
more inclined to be masked by natural
variability. Occasional strong forcing in seasons
other than winter can produce strong and
identifiable signals in the northern hemisphere and,
because the noise of natural variability is less,
the signal-to-noise ratio can be Large. The relative
importance of tropical versus extratropical SST
forcings has been established through numerical
experiments with atmospheric general circulation
models (AGCMs). Predictability of anomalous
circulation and associated surface temperature and
precipitation in the extratropics is somewhat
limited by the difficulty of finding a modest signal
embedded in the high level of noise from natural
variability in the extra;tropics, and the complexity
and variety of the possible feedbacks. Accordingly,
ensembles of AGCM runs and time averaging are needed
to identify signals and make predictions. Strong
anomalous tropical forcing provides opportunities
for skillful forecasts, and the accuracy and
usefulness of forecasts is expected to improve as
the ability to forecast the anomalous SSTs improves,
as models improve, and as the information available
from the mean and the spread of ensemble forecasts
is better utilized.},

western North America during the Medieval period
resulting in a more arid climate than in subsequent
centuries. A review of proxy evidence from around
the world indicates that North American megadroughts
were part of a global pattern of Medieval
hydroclimate that was distinct from that of
today. In particular, the Medieval hydroclimate was
wet in northern South America, dry in mid-latitude
South America, dry in eastern Africa but with strong
Nile River floods and a strong Indian monsoon. This
pattern is similar to that accompanying persistent
North American droughts in the instrumental
era. This pattern is compared to that associated
with familiar climate phenomena. The best fit comes
from a persistently La Ni (n) over tildea-like
tropical Pacific and the warm phase of the so-called
Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. A positive North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) also helps to explain the
Medieval hydroclimate pattern. Limited sea surface
temperature reconstructions support the contention
that the tropical Pacific was cold and the
subtropical North Atlantic was warm, ideal
conditions for North American drought. Tentative
modeling results indicate that a multi-century La Ni
(n) over tildea-like state could have arisen as a
coupled atmosphere-ocean response to high irradiance
and weak volcanism during the Medieval period and
that this could in turn have induced a persistently
positive NAO state. A La Ni (n) over tildea-like
state could also induce a strengthening of the North
Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and
hence warming of the North Atlantic Ocean, by (i)
the ocean response to the positive NAO and by
shifting the southern mid-latitude westerlies
poleward which (ii) will increase the salt flux from
the Indian Ocean into the South Atlantic and (iii)
drive stronger Southern Ocean upwelling. (C) 2007

   abstract = {A detailed description is presented of the statistical patterns of climate forcing of tree growth (annual maximum latewood density and ring-width time series), across a network of 387 specially selected conifer sites that circle the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere. The in uence of summer temperature dominates growth. A mean April-September response is optimum for describing the major forcing signal over the whole densito-metric network, though a shorter June-July season is more relevant in central and eastern Siberia. The ring- width chronologies also have a shorter optimum (June-August) seasonal signal, but this is much weaker than the density signal. The association between tree-ring density and precipitation variability (as measured by partial correlations to account for the correlation between temperature and precipitation) is considerably weaker than with temperature. The ring-width response to precipitation is dominated by noise' and local site in uences, though a negative response to winter precipitation in northern Siberia is consistent with the suggestion of an in uence of delayed snowmelt. Average correlations with winter temperatures are small for all regions and correlations with annual temperatures are positive only because of the strong link with summer temperatures. Reconstructions of summer temperature based on composite regional density chronologies for nine areas are presented. Five regions (northwestern North America, NWNA; eastern and central Canada, ECCA; northern Europe, NEUR; northern Siberia, NSIB; and eastern Siberia, ESIB) constitute an arbitrary northern' division of the network, while the four other regions (western North America, WNA; southern Europe, SEUR; central Asia, CAS; and the Tibetan Plateau, TIBP) make up the southern' part. We also present two larger composite regional reconstructions comprising the data from the five higher-latitude (HILAT) and four lower-latitude (LOLAT) areas respectively; and a single series made up of data from all regions (ALL), which is highly correlated with Northern Hemisphere mean summer temperature. We calculate time-dependent uncertainty ranges for each of these reconstructions, though they are not intended to represent long timescales of tempera ture variability (>100 years) because the technique used to assemble the site chronologies precludes this. Finally, we examine in more detail the reduced sensitivity in the tree-growth data to decadal-timescale summer-temperature trends during the last 50 years, identified in earlier published work.},

does not explain the rainfall trend in the

   abstract = {South-central New Mexico, USA, at the junction of
the Rocky Mountains, High Plains and Chihuahuan
Desert, is one of the better known regions in the
late Quaternary of North America. Plant macrofossils
and pollen from a packrat midden series in Rough
Canyon, New Mexico allows refinement of plant
distributions and paleoclimates in this transitional
area since full glacial times. From 17000 to 12000
C-14 yr BP, Pinus edulis-Juniperus scopulorum
woodlands dominated limestone substrates between
1800 and 1490 m. with Pseudotsuga menziesii and
other mixed-conifer species restricted to shady,
north-facing slopes. Juniperus deppeana, the
dominant juniper today above 2000 m in southern New
Mexico, is conspicuously absent from glacial middens
and must have been displaced south of the US-Mexico
border. The minimum climatic conditions for
P. edulis-J. scopulorum woodlands are ca 20% wetter
and 3.5-5 degreesC cooler (July mean maximum
temperatures) than the modern climate at Rough
Canyon. Holocene warming/drying may have started as
early as 12 000 C-14 yr BP with the extirpation of
J. scopulorum from Rough Canyon, and was completed
by at least 10 540 C-14 yr BP. The record for
arrivals of some desert species is confounded by
traces of pollen and macrofossils in some of the
glacial middens, which could signify either earliest
occurrence or temporal mixing (contamination) of
assemblages. AMS C-14 dating can discriminate
between early arrival and contamination in midden
macrofossils but not in pollen. AMS dates show that
Choisya dumosa, presently near its northern (cold)
limits at Rough Canyon, endured late glacial
winters, possibly as clonal populations. Some Larrea
tridentata leaves and pollen occur in middens
dominated by conifers and oaks no longer at the
site; an AMS date of 3205 C-14 yr BP on Larrea
leaves from one midden indicates
contamination. Evidence for some macrofossil
contamination, however, does not rule out the
possibility that pollen of desert elements
(e.g. Larrea, Prosopis) in late glacial-early
Holocene middens indicates their presence in the
Tularosa Basin, well ahead of their local appearance
in Rough Canyon. Finally, the increasing dominance
of desert elements after 5000 C-14 yr BP in the
Rough Canyon series and elsewhere in the northern
Chihuahuan Desert could reflect slow, postglacial
migration from the south and/or progressive
encroachment with gradual stripping of soils formed
during the last glacial period. (C) 2001 Elsevier

system is the primary driver of interannual
variability in global climate, but its long-term
behaviour is poorly understood. Instrumental
observations reveal a shift in 1976 towards warmer
and wetter conditions in the tropical Pacific, with
widespread climatic and ecological
consequences(1-3). This shift, unique over the past
century(4), has prompted debate over the influence
of increasing atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases on ENSO variability(5-7). Here we
present a 155-year ENSO reconstruction from a
central tropical Pacific coral that provides new
evidence for long-term changes in the regional mean
climate and its variability. A gradual transition in
the early twentieth century and the abrupt change in
1976, both towards warmer and wetter conditions,
co-occur with changes in variability. In the
mid-late nineteenth century, cooler and drier
background conditions coincided with prominent
decadal variability; in the early twentieth century,
shorter-period (similar to2.9 years) variability
intensified. After 1920, variability weakens and
becomes focused at interannual timescales; with the
shift in 1976, variability with a period of about 4
years becomes prominent. Our results suggest that
variability in the tropical Pacific is linked to the
region's mean climate, and that changes in both have
occurred during periods of natural as well as
anthropogenic climate forcing.},

   abstract = {An asymmetry, and its multidecadal variability, in a
rainfall teleconnection with the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) are described. Further, the
breakdown of this relationship since 1980 is offered
as a cause for a rainfall reduction in an
ENSO-affected region, southeast Queensland
(SEQ). There, austral summer rainfall has been
declining since around the 1980s, but the associated
process is not understood. It is demonstrated that
the rainfall reduction is not simulated by the
majority of current climate models forced with
anthropogenic forcing factors. Examination shows
that ENSO is a rainfall-generating mechanism for the
region because of an asymmetry in its impact: the La
Nina-rainfall relationship is statistically
significant, as SEQ summer rainfall increases with
La Nina amplitude; by contrast, the El Nino-induced
rainfall reductions do not have a statistically
significant relationship with El Nino
amplitude. Since 1980, this asymmetry no longer
operates, and La Nina events no longer induce a
rainfall increase, leading to the observed SEQ
rainfall reduction. A similar asymmetric rainfall
teleconnection with ENSO Modoki exists and shares
the same temporal evolutions. This breakdown is
caused by an eastward shift in the Walker
circulation and the convection center near
Australia's east coast, in association with a
post-1980 positive phase of the interdecadal Pacific
oscillation (IPO). Such a breakdown occurred before
1950, indicating that multidecadal variability alone
could potentially be responsible for the recent SEQ
rainfall decline. An aggregation of outputs from
climate models to distill the impact of climate
change suggests that the asymmetry and the breakdown
may not be generated by climate change, although
most models do not perform well in simulating the
ENSO-rainfall teleconnection over the SEQ region.},

twentieth century Sahelian drought when only forced
by observed SST time evolution has been
characterized. Atmospheric internal variability is
shown to have a strong contribution in driving the
simulated precipitation variability over the Sahel
at decadal to multi-decadal time scales. The
simulated drought is associated with a southward
shift of the continental rainbelt over central and
eastern Sahel, associated with an inter-hemispheric
SST mode (the southern hemisphere oceans warming
faster than the northern ones after 1970). The
analysis of idealized experiments further highlights
the importance of the Pacific basin. The related
increase of the tropospheric temperature (TT) over
the tropics is then suggested to dry the margin of
convection zones over Africa, in agreement with the
so-called "upped-ante" mechanism. A simple metric is
then defined to determine the ability of the CMIP3
coupled models in reproducing both the observed
Sahel drying and these mechanisms, in order to
determine the reliability of the twenty-first
century scenarios. Only one model reproduces both
the observed drought over the Sahel and consistent
SST/TT relationships over the second half of the
twentieth century. This model predicts enhanced dry
conditions over the Sahel at the end of the
twenty-first century. However, as the mechanisms
highlighted here for the recent period are not
stationary during the twenty-first century when
considering the trends, similarities between

but insufficient condition for a trustworthy

Quasi-Decadal Oscillation (QDO) observed in global
climate variability during the 20th Century (Allan,
2000) dominated tropical Indian Ocean climate
variability from 1993-2002. Both signals shared a
delayed action oscillator (DAO) similar to that
shared by corresponding signals in the tropical
Pacific Ocean (White et al., 2003), intensified in
the South Indian Ocean. Each signal was
characterized by a short-lived east-west tropical
dipole in sea level height (SLH) and sea surface
temperature (SST) variability, with the warm SST
phase in the western ocean transitioning to the cool
phase in response to slow, westward-propagating,
upwelling coupled Rossby waves in the tropical South
Indian Ocean. The cool phase in the eastern ocean
transitioning to the warm phase in response to slow,
eastward-propagating, downwelling equatorial coupled
waves. At both boundaries, the simultaneous
incidence of these coupled waves provides a delayed
negative feedback to tropical SST variability,
together producing a DAO that accounts for each
signal, similar to those observed in the Pacific
Ocean (White et al., 2003). This description allows
us to construct a DAO model of the ENSO in the
Indian Ocean that demonstrates how boundary
reflections of the coupled waves, their
intensification by wind stress forcing, and inherent
delays in their propagation yield observed frequency
and amplitude. Thus, warm SST variability in the
western tropical Indian Ocean during 1995, 1998, and
2002 arose not from zonal atmospheric
teleconnections originating with ENSO in the
tropical Pacific Ocean, but from a DAO intrinsic to
the tropical Indian Ocean that co-oscillated with
that governing ENSO in the tropical Pacific Ocean.},

States and Mexico for a 26-yr (1963-88) period and
various fields from the National Centers for
Environmental Prediction-National Center for
Atmospheric Research Reanalysis are used to compare
and contrast hydrologic conditions and atmospheric
circulation features associated with early, late,
wet, and dry monsoons in each region. Relationships
between anomalous monsoon behavior and the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon are
examined. Some factors associated with the
atmosphere's lower boundary conditions that might
influence the interannual variability of the warm
season precipitation regime are discussed. The mean
seasonal evolution of the North American monsoon
system is characterized by the regular northward
progression of heavy precipitation from southern
Mexico by early June to the southwestern United
States by early July. While the seasonal normal
rainfall and its variability are largest in
southwest Mexico, the mean seasonal percent
departure from normal is largest in Arizona-New
Mexico. Wet (dry) monsoons in southwest Mexico tend
to occur during La Nina (El Nino). This association
is attributed, in part, to the impact of local sea
surface temperature anomalies on the land-sea
thermal contrast, hence the strength of the
monsoon. There is also a weak association between
dry monsoons in Arizona-New Mexico (northwest
Mexico) and La Nina (El Nino). Wet summer monsoons
in Arizona-New Mexico tend to follow winters
characterized by dry conditions in the southwestern
United States and vice versa. Although the onset
and duration of the monsoon are guile regular in
each region, the precise dare of onset in a given
region is highly variable and likely to he unrelated
to the date of onset in the other regions. Early
monsoons in Arizona-New Mexico tend to have heavy
seasonal rainfall while late monsoons in northwest
Mexico tend to have deficient seasonal rainfall. The
onset date in southwest Mexico is not related to
seasonal rainfall. However, interannual fluctuations
in rainfall over the entire monsoon region for the
2-month period after onset in southwest Mexico are
highly correlated, suggesting that knowledge of the
starting dare in southwest Mexico may be useful for
analyzing, understanding, and possibly predicting
these fluctuations.},

provided insights into the factors that control the
strength of the East Asian monsoon(1-4). Our
understanding of these factors remains incomplete,
however, owing to gaps in the record of monsoon
history over the past two interglacial - glacial
cycles. In particular, missing sections have
hampered our ability to test ideas about orbital-
scale controls on the monsoon(5-7), the causes of
millennial- scale events(8,9) and relationships
between changes in the monsoon and climate in other
regions. Here we present an absolute- dated oxygen
isotope record from Sanbao cave, central China, that
completes a Chinese-cave-based record of the
strength of the East Asian monsoon that covers the
past 224,000 years. The record is dominated by
23,000-year- long cycles that are synchronous within
dating errors with summer insolation at 65 degrees N
(ref. 10), supporting the idea that tropical/
subtropical monsoons respond dominantly and directly
to changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation
on orbital timescales(5). The cycles are punctuated
by millennial- scale strong-summer-monsoon events
(Chinese interstadials(1)), and the new record
allows us to identify the complete series of these
events over the past two interglacial - glacial
cycles. Their duration decreases and their frequency
increases during glacial build- up in both the last

sheet size affects their character and pacing. The
ages of the events are exceptionally well

June) precipitation spanning 1260 - 1998 A. D. The
reconstruction exhibits considerable
nonstationarity, and the instrumental era
(post-1900) in particular fails to capture the full
range of precipitation variability experienced in
the past; 750 years. Both single-year and
decadal-scale dry events were more severe before
1900. Dry spells in the late thirteenth and
sixteenth centuries surpass both magnitude and
duration of any droughts in the Bighorn Basin after
1900. Precipitation variability appears to shift to
a higher-frequency mode after 1750, with 15 - 20-yr
droughts becoming rare. Comparisons between
instrumental and reconstructed values of
precipitation and indices of Pacific basin
variability reveal that precipitation in the Bighorn
Basin generally responds to Pacific forcing in a
manner similar to that of the southwestern United
States ( drier during La Nina events), but high
country precipitation in areas surrounding the basin
displays the opposite response ( drier during El

of climate fields from sparse observational networks
of proxy data, employing the technique of reduced
space objective analysis, is applied to the
reconstruction of gridded Pacific Ocean Basin sea
surface temperature (SST) from coral stable isotope
(delta(18)O) data for the period 1607-1990. In this
approach we seek to reconstruct only the leading
modes of large-scale variability which are both
observed in the modern climate and resolved in the
proxy data. We find that the coral data verifiably
resolve two spatial patterns of SST variability. The
first and dominant pattern is that of the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). A second pattern
reflects uniform changes over most of the Pacific
Basin. Calibration and verification tests for
1856-1990 show that root-mean-square variance is
small (less than or equal to0.5degreesC RMS) and
reconstruction errors are large (less than or equal
to0.6degreesC RMS), limiting interpretation to the
tropical region. Periods of enhanced ENSO activity
similar to those observed in the past two decades
are evident in the reconstruction for the early
nineteenth century. The changing frequency of ENSO
warm phase events appears to coincide with warming
of the Pacific mean state inferred from similar
reconstruction efforts using tree ring indicators
over the last two centuries.},

relationships between plant phenology and
satellite-sensor-derived measures of greenness, and
to advance a new procedure for determining the
growing season of land vegetation at the regional

sample sites to represent different climatic zones
and vegetation types in northern China. The mixed
data set consists of occurrence dates of all
observed phenophases for 50-70 kinds of trees and
shrubs from 1983 to 1988. Using these data, we
calculated the cumulative frequency of phenophases
in every 5-day period (pentad) throughout each year,
and also drew the cumulative frequency distribution
curve for all station-years, in order to reveal the
typical seasonal characteristics of these plant
communities. The growing season was set as the time
interval between 5% and 95% of the phenological
cumulative frequency. Average lengths of the growing
season varied between 188 days in the northern, to
259 days in the southern part of the research
region. The beginning and end dates of the surface
growing season were then applied each year as time
thresholds, to determine the corresponding 10-day
peak greenness values from normalized difference
vegetation index curves for 8-km(2) pixels overlying
the phenological stations. Our results show that, at
the beginning of the growing season, the largest
average greenness value occurs in the southern part,
then in the northern, and finally the middle part of
the research region. In contrast, at the end of the
growing season, the largest average greenness value
is measured in the northern part, next in the middle
and lastly the southern part of the research
region. In future studies, these derived NDVI
thresholds can be applied to determine the growing
season of similar plant communities at other sites,
which lack surface phenological data.},

   abstract = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the ultimate change in global mean temperature in response to a change in external forcing. Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.},

techniques. The Standardized Precipitation Index

give a better representation of abnormal wetness and
dryness than the Palmer indices. Before the user
community will accept the SPI as an alternative to
the Palmer indices, a standard method must be
developed for computing the index. Standardization
is necessary so that all users of the index will
have a common basis for both spatial and temporal
comparison of index values. If different probability
distributions and models are used to describe an
observed series of precipitation, then different SPI
values may be obtained. This article describes the
effect on the SPI values computed from different
probability models as well as the effects on dry
event characteristics. It is concluded that the
Pearson Type III distribution is the "best"
universal model, and that the reliability of the SPI
is sample size dependent. It is also concluded that
because of data limitations, SPIs with time scales
longer than 24 months may be unreliable. An internet

from eastern North America provide a measure of the
amount of climatic change that occurred on a broad
spatial scale since the last glacial maximum (21,000

the difference between pollen samples, and, thus,
represent the potential magnitude of climatic change
underlying the pollen record. The magnitude varied
significantly among time scales with small changes
common at centennial to millennial scales and large
changes common at multi-millennial (i.e. orbital)
scales. SCDs measured across 3000-yr intervals
averaged 0.20, and often exceeded the maximum
difference expected from samples collected within
the same biome (0.15). SCDs across individual
millennia were smaller and averaged 0.08. SCDs

large at sub-millennial scales, equal about 5-25% of

20 years. Across the conterminous USA, a readily

growth at the start of the spring season (SOS) is of
special interest, as it appears to be crucial for
accurate computation of several important biospheric
processes, and a sensitive measure of the impacts of
global change. In this study, satellite-derived SOS
dates produced by the delayed moving average (DMA)

modelled surface phenology (spring indices, SI) were

woodland sites during 1990-93 and 1995-99, and these
three measures were also matched to native species

   abstract = {[1] Incorporating stable isotope physics in a
general circulation model (GCM) provides a promising
means to study isotopic variability in
precipitation, including the processes that cause
isotopic variability in paleoclimatic archives such
as ice cores. This paper describes the
implementation and validation of stable isotope
tracers in the GENESIS 2.0 GCM. The model reproduces
the main features of present-day isotopic fields and
the characteristic large-scale isotope-climate
relationships. Global delta(18)O-deltaD,
temperature-delta(18)O, and precipitation-delta(18)O
relationships are well simulated, and the modeled
regional patterns associated with continental vapor
recycling over Europe and vertical gradients agree
well with observations. In GENESIS a more
sophisticated parameterization of interactions
between precipitation and atmospheric vapor
contributes to a better simulation of isotopic
variations in dry climates. The standard model
underestimates the global mean deuterium excess
(deltaD-8delta(18)O) in precipitation, although a
heuristic sensitivity test suggests this may be
remedied by accounting for nonneutral stratification
in isotopic evaporative fractionation over
ocean. Errors in simulated isotopic fields are
analyzed to determine whether they are caused by
local climatic biases in the GCM or by inaccurate
parameterizations of isotope physics. Using the
results of sensitivity experiments and comparisons
with other isotopic GCM results, we identify key
isotopic and climatic processes at the origin of the
main errors and suggest additional studies to
improve isotope simulations.},

South American monsoon rainfall is carried out
separately for austral spring and summer (and for
November and January), based on a 40-yr station
gauge dataset. Relationships between modes of
variability in these seasons show the influence of
antecedent conditions in spring (or November) on the
evolution of the monsoon rainfall in peak summer (or
January). In spring the first mode is dipolelike,
with opposite loadings over central-eastern and
southeastern South America. It is connected with
ENSO. The second mode shows the highest loadings
slightly south of the South Atlantic convergence
zone. The leading mode of summer also features
dipolelike oscillations between central-eastern and
southeastern South America, but is not strongly
connected with ENSO. The second mode represents the
impact of ENSO, and the third is modulated by SST
anomalies in the southern tropical Atlantic.
Significant relationships are disclosed between the
first dipolelike modes of spring and summer rainfall
and thus between the rainfall in spring and summer
over central-eastern South America, which includes
part of the monsoon core region. These dipolelike
modes are associated with a rotational anomaly over
southeast Brazil that either conveys moisture flux
into central-eastern Brazil (if it is cyclonic) or
into southeastern South America (if it is
anticyclonic). In spring this anomaly seems to be
remotely forced, but after strong rainfall anomalies
over central-eastern Brazil in spring, it tends to
reverse sign in peak summer, inverting the
dipolelike rainfall anomalies. This reversal is
hypothesized to be locally forced by
surface-atmosphere feedback triggered by the spring
anomalies, as weaker teleconnections in summer allow
local processes that are stronger in summer to
overcome remote forcing. SST and circulation
anomalies associated with the first modes in spring
and summer, and also the relationship between the
first summer mode and surface temperature in spring,
are consistent with that hypothesis.},

   abstract = {To extend the linear stochastically forced paradigm
of tropical sea surface temperature (SST)
variability to the subsurface ocean, a linear
inverse model (LIM) is constructed from the
simultaneous and 3-month lag covariances of observed
3-month running mean anomalies of SST, thermocline
depth, and zonal wind stress. This LIM is then used
to identify the empirically-determined linear
dynamics with physical processes to gauge their
relative importance to ENSO evolution. Optimal
growth of SST anomalies over several months is
triggered by both an initial SST anomaly and a
central equatorial Pacific thermocline anomaly that
propagates slowly eastward while leading the
amplifying SST anomaly. The initial SST and
thermocline anomalies each produce roughly half the
SST amplification. If interactions between the sea
surface and the thermocline are removed in the
linear dynamical operator, the SST anomaly undergoes
less optimal growth but is also more persistent, and
its location shifts from the eastern to central
Pacific. Optimal growth is also found to be
essentially the result of two stable eigenmodes with
similar structure but differing 2- and 4-year
periods evolving from initial destructive to
constructive interference. Variations among ENSO
events could then be a consequence not of changing
stability characteristics but of random excitation
of these two eigenmodes, which represent different
balances between surface and subsurface coupled
dynamics. As found in previous studies, the impact
of the additional variables on LIM SST forecasts is
relatively small for short time scales. Over time
intervals greater than about 9 months, however, the
additional variables both significantly enhance
forecast skill and predict lag covariances and
associated power spectra whose closer agreement with
observations enhances the validation of the linear
model. Moreover, a secondary type of optimal growth
exists that is not present in a LIM constructed from
SST alone, in which initial SST anomalies in the
southwest tropical Pacific and Indian ocean play a
larger role than on shorter time scales, apparently
driving sustained off-equatorial wind stress
anomalies in the eastern Pacific that result in a
more persistent equatorial thermocline anomaly and a
more protracted (and predictable) ENSO event.},

time skill in monthly and seasonal predictions based
solely on patterns of antecedent hydrological
information over the United States. The hydrological
information is contained in a proxy for soil
moisture at 102 locations over the lower 48
states. This soil moisture is calculated over the
years 1931 to present from a local hydrological
equation taking monthly precipitation (P) and
temperature (T) as input, and producing soil
moisture (w), evaporation (E), runoff (R), and loss
to groundwater (G) as output. The initial condition
(IC) for the forecast procedure is soil moisture
over the United States at the end of the month
(w30). We constructed an analogue to the w30 fields,
i.e., made linear combinations of soil moisture
fields at the same time of year in years past to
reproduce the IC to within a small tolerance. The
coefficients assigned to the years past are then
made to persist, and the subsequent development in
the historical years is linearly combined to form a
forecast. This method has been running at CPC in
real time since 1998, and we added 1981-1997 in
"retroactive real time" mode to form a large enough
sample. In total, we considered both seasonal and
monthly forecasts at leads of -1 to +6 months for
1981-2001, for the elements w30, E, T, and P. From
the outset, we wanted to investigate nonlocal
forecast methods, considering local effects, on
evaporation and temperature mainly, as being
established already and well documented [Huang et
al., 1996]. In a nonlocal method we entertain the
possibility of precipitation (the response) falling
downstream of a soil moisture anomaly (forcing). We
found that we have about a 0.6 correlation in
forecasting monthly soil moisture with a lead of one
month (i.e., July at the end of May). This figure is
higher in spring and somewhat lower in the early
fall. The capability to forecast evaporation
anomalies is very seasonal. During the cold half of
the year, when E anomalies resemble T anomalies, the
correlation is only 0.2-0.3, but in summer, when E
anomalies resemble w anomalies, the skill of
forecasts goes up to 0.6. We thus have some insight
into patterns of anomalous water vapor input from
the land surface into the lower atmosphere on a
continental scale. Skill of forecasting T is modest,
reaching 0.2-0.3 in many months and seasons, but
there is no clear seasonal dependence that relates
to the presumed physics of land atmosphere
interactions. Skill in forecasting P is quite low,
barely 0.1 in correlation, but +ve in all months and
seasons. We did alternative experiments where the
constructed analogue was built on E, T, or P instead
of w and verified the forecast of all elements
likewise. We found initial w to be the best for
forecasting w itself and indeed for forecasting the
other fields as well! This is important testimony
that soil moisture is indeed the key, as has been
suspected by many for ages.},

out variability on longer and shorter time

preindustrial control (unforced) simulations from 18

for the great majority of simulations, but were
negative, as observed, for seven simulations. Only a
few simulations exhibited the observed rapid rate of
warming ( cooling) during 1901 - 40 ( 1940 -
79). Those models with multiple runs ( identical
forcing but different initial conditions) showed
considerable intramodel variability with trends
varying by up to 1.8 degrees C century(-1),
suggesting that internal dynamic variability played
a major role at the regional scale. The wide range
of trend outcomes, particularly for those models
with multiple runs, and the small number of
simulations similar to observations in both the
forced and unforced experiments suggest that the
warming hole is not a robust response of
contemporary CGCMs to the estimated external
forcings. A more likely explanation based on these
models is that the observed warming hole involves
external forcings combined with internal dynamic
variability that is much larger than typically
simulated. The observed CUS temperature variations
are positively correlated with North Atlantic (NA)
sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and both NA SSTs
and CUS temperature are negatively correlated with
central equatorial Pacific (CEP) SSTs. Most models
simulate rather well the connection between CUS
temperature and NA SSTs. However, the
teleconnections between NA and CEP SSTS and between

   abstract = {Analytical theory is used to examine the linear
response of a meridionally unbounded stratified
ocean to large-scale, low-frequency wind
forcing. The following results, applied mainly to
the equatorial Pacific, were obtained. (i) Provided
that the wind stress curl vanishes at large distance
from the equator, a general Sverdrup solution is
valid in the quasi-steady (frequency omega -> 0)
limit. The meridionally averaged zonal flow toward
the western boundary layer is zero so that there is
no net mass flow into the boundary layer and the
large-scale boundary condition is therefore
satisfied. This solution predicts a zero pycnocline
response in the eastern equatorial Pacific. It
therefore predicts that, for the eastern equatorial
Pacific, a slow weakening of the equatorial trade
winds will not lead to long-term El Nino conditions
there. (ii) Consistent with observations and other
previous work, for finite but small frequencies
there are two modes of equatorial motion. One is a
"tilt'' mode in which the equatorial sea level and
thermocline are tilted by the in-phase zonal wind
stress and the other is an equatorial warm water
volume (WWV) mode in which the discharge of
equatorial warm water (negative WWV anomaly) lags
the wind stress forcing by a quarter of a
period. (iii) The amplitude of the WWV mode
approaches zero like omega(1/2). Therefore, as omega
-> 0, the equatorial solution reduces to the tilt
mode. (iv) The WWV mode is not due to a dominant
meridional divergence driven by the wind, as
suggested by some previous work. Meridional and
zonal divergence approximately cancel. Reflection of
energy at both ocean boundaries together with the
strong dependence of long Rossby wave speed on
latitude is crucial to the existence of the
disequilibrium WWV mode. Because higher-latitude
Rossby waves travel so much more slowly, the Rossby
waves reflecting from the western ocean boundary are
not in phase. This gives rise to a reflected
equatorial Kelvin wave and a WWV that is not in
phase with the wind stress forcing. (v) Observations
from past work have shown that much low-frequency
wave energy, particularly westward propagating
Rossby wave energy poleward of about 5 degrees N and
5 degrees S, is damped out before it reaches the
western ocean boundary. In this way dissipation
likely has a strong influence on the equatorial
Kelvin wave reflection and hence the disequilibrium
WWV.},

of these changes requires a large-scale atmospheric

North Atlantic Ocean, such as interstadials and the
Bolling-Allerod warming, correspond to drier
conditions in the southwestern United

latitudes are associated with increased regional
moisture. We propose that interstadial warming of
the North Atlantic Ocean diverted the westerly storm
track northward, perhaps through weakening of the
Aleutian Low, and thereby reduced moisture delivery
to southwestern North America. A similar response to

   abstract = {Nobody anticipated that El Nino would be weak and
prolonged in 1992, but brief and intense in
1997/98. Why are various El Nino episodes so
different, and so difficult to predict? The answer
involves the important role played by random
atmospheric disturbances (such as westerly wind
bursts) in sustaining the weakly damped Southern
Oscillation, whose complementary warm and cold
phases are, respectively, El Nino and La Nina. As in
the case of a damped pendulum sustained by modest
blows at random times, so the predictability of El
Nino is limited, not by the amplification of errors
in initial conditions as in the case of weather, but
mainly by atmospheric disturbances interacting with
the Southern Oscillation. Given the statistics of
the wind fluctuations, the probability distribution
function of future sea surface temperature
fluctuations in the eastern equatorial Pacific can
be determined by means of an ensemble of
calculations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere
model. Each member of the ensemble starts from the
same initial conditions and has, superimposed, a
different realization of the noise. Such a
prediction, made at the end of 1996, would have
assigned a higher likelihood to a moderate event
than to the extremely strong event that actually
occurred in 1997. (The rapid succession of several
westerly wind bursts in early 1997 was a relatively
rare phenomenon.) In late 2001, conditions were
similar to those in 1996, which suggested a
relatively high probability of El Nino appearing in
2002. Whether the event will be weak or intense
depends on the random disturbances that materialize
during the year.},

large, but even small temporal changes in prebomb
Delta(14)C suggest that important changes in the

   abstract = {Observational analyses are performed to examine the
roles of remote and local forcing in the evolutions
of the extreme U.S. summer heat wave-drought cases
of 1980 and 1988. At early stages, both events are
associated with anomalous stationary wave
patterns. Wave activity flux analyses suggest that
in the 1980 case anomalous wave activity propagates
southeastward from an apparent source region to the
south of the Aleutians. The flux pattern is more
complex in the 1988 case but suggests two possible
source regions, one over the central North Pacific
to the north of the Hawaiian Islands and a second
located over the far western Pacific. The 1988
analyses show no anomalous wave propagation out of
the eastern tropical Pacific, although this result
does not necessarily preclude a role for tropical
forcing in generating the anomalous wave train. In
both cases the anomalous wave trains and associated
wave activity fluxes become very weak by early July,
indicating that remotely forced anomalous stationary
waves are unlikely to account for the later stages
of the heat wave-droughts. This leads us to examine
whether these events were enhanced or prolonged by
changes in the local surface energy budget
associated with reductions in evapotranspiration
(ET) over the drought regions, Water vapor budgets
show a systematic decrease in monthly mean ET from
June to August during both events. Comparisons with
nondrought summers support the idea that by late
summer ET rates in both events are anomalously
low. Estimated reductions in surface latent heat
fluxes relative to the control years are
approximately 50 W m(-2) in 1980 and 20 W m(-2) in
1988, with implied increases in sensible heating of
similar magnitudes. Overall, the results indicate
the importance of both dynamical forcing from remote
sources and anomalous local boundary conditions in
accounting for the two extreme heat wave-drought
events. The relative importance of these factors
varies significantly during the evolution of the
events, with remote forcing playing a predominant
role at early stages and anomalous local boundary
conditions assuming increasing importance at later
stages.},

for up to 40% of the variability on interannual to

meridional circulation south of Australia that
simultaneously produces a northward flow of
relatively cool, dry air to southwest Western
Australia and a southward flow of warm, moist air to
East Antarctica. This pattern of meridional flow is
consistent with some projections of circulation
changes arising from anthropogenic climate
change. The precipitation anomaly of the past few
decades in Law Dome is the largest in 750 years, and
lies outside the range of variability for the record

partition the trends into components linearly
congruent with and linearly independent of the
annular modes. The index of the Northern Hemisphere
(NH) annular mode, referred to as the Arctic
Oscillation (AO), has exhibited a trend toward the
high index polarity over the past few decades. The
largest and most significant trends are observed
during the "active season" for stratospheric
planetary wave-mean flow interaction, January-March
(JFM), when fluctuations in the AO amplify with
height into the lower stratosphere. For the periods
of record considered, virtually all of the JFM
geopotential height falls over the polar cap region
and the strengthening of the subpolar westerlies
from the surface to the lower stratosphere, similar
to 50% of the JFM warming over the Eurasian
continent, similar to 30% of the JFM warming over
the NH as a whole, similar to 40% of the JFM
stratospheric cooling over the polar cap region, and
similar to 40% of the March total column ozone
losses poleward of 40 degrees N are linearly
congruent with month-to-month variations in the AO
index. Summertime sea level pressure falls over the
Arctic basin are suggestive of a year-round drift
toward the positive polarity of the AO, but the
evidence is less conclusive. Owing to the
photochemical memory inherent in the ozone
distribution, roughly half the ozone depletion
during the NH summer months is linearly dependent on
AO-related ozone lasses incurred during the previous
active season. Lower-tropospheric geopotential
height falls over the Antarctic polar cap region are
indicative of a drift toward the high index polarity
of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode with no
apparent seasonality. In contrast, the trend toward
a cooling and strengthening of the SH stratospheric
polar vortex peaks sharply during the stratosphere's
relatively short active season centered in
November. The most pronounced SE ozone losses have
occurred in September-October, one or two months
prior to this active season. In both hemispheres,
positive feedbacks involving ozone destruction,
cooling, and a weakening of the wave-driven
meridional circulation may be contributing to a
delayed breakdown of the polar vortex and enhanced
ozone losses during spring.},

related to the fact that some of the constituent

divergence against local temperatures in the recent

no divergence against local temperatures. These data

set, we developed a new, completely independent

existing reconstructions but allows some degree of
independent validation of these earlier studies as
well as demonstrating that TR data can better model
recent warming at large scales when careful
selection of constituent chronologies is made at the
local scale. Although the new series tracks the
increase in ENH annual temperatures over the last
few decades better than any existing reconstruction,
it still slightly under predicts values in the

Recent droughts with broad impacts over the conterminous U.S. (1996, 1999-2002) were associated with North Atlantic warming (positive AMO) and northeastern and tropical Pacific cooling (negative PDO). Much of the long-term predictability of drought frequency may reside in the multidecadal behavior of the North Atlantic Ocean.

average surface air temperatures have varied in the

climate reconstructions indicate that slow cooling
took place until the beginning of the 20th
century. Subsequently, global-average surface air
temperature increased by about 0.6 degrees C with
the 1990s being the warmest decade on record. The
pattern of warming has been greatest over
mid-latitude northern continents in the latter part
of the century. At the same time the frequency of
air frosts has decreased over many land areas, and
there has been a drying in the tropics and
sub-tropics. The late 20th century changes have been
attributed to global warming because of increases in
atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations due to
human activities. Underneath these trends is that of
decadal scale variability in the Pacific basin at
least induced by the Interdecadal Pacific
Oscillation (IPO), which causes decadal changes in
climate averages. On interannnual timescales El Ni
(n) over tildeo/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) causes
much variability throughout many tropical and
subtropical regions and some mid-latitude areas. The
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) provides climate
perturbations over Europe and northern

to increase by 2 to 4.5 degrees C as greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere increase. At the

rainfall and drought are expected to increase in
many areas. The combination of global warming,
superimposed on decadal climate variability (IPO)

expected lead to a century of increasing climate
variability and change that will be unprecedented in

The relationship between fluctuations and dissipation is discussed in a framework of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and a link between maximization of entropy production and scale invariance is hypothesized.

temperature has increased by approximately 0.6
degreesC and is projected to continue to rise at a
rapid rate(1). Although species have responded to
climatic changes throughout their evolutionary
history(2), a primary concern for wild species and
their ecosystems is this rapid rate of change(3). We
gathered information on species and global warming
from 143 studies for our meta-analyses. These
analyses reveal a consistent temperature-related
shift, or `fingerprint', in species ranging from
molluscs to mammals and from grasses to
trees. Indeed, more than 80% of the species that
show changes are shifting in the direction expected
on the basis of known physiological constraints of
species. Consequently, the balance of evidence from
these studies strongly suggests that a significant
impact of global warming is already discernible in
animal and plant populations. The synergism of rapid
temperature rise and other stresses, in particular
habitat destruction, could easily disrupt the
connectedness among species and lead to a
reformulation of species communities, reflecting
differential changes in species, and to numerous
extirpations and possibly extinctions.},

   abstract = {The Bosumtwi impact crater in Ghana, arguably the
best-preserved complex young impact structure known
on Earth, displays a pronounced rim and is almost
completely filled by Lake Bosumtwi, a hydrologically
closed basin. It is the source crater of the Ivory
Coast tektites. The structure was excavated in
2.1-2.2 Gyr old metasediments and metavolcanics of
the Birimian Supergroup. A drilling project was
conceived that would combine two major scientific
interests in this crater: 1) to obtain a complete
paleoenvironmental record from the time of crater
formation about one million years ago, at a
near-equatorial location in Africa for which very
few data are available so far, and 2) to obtain a
complete record of impactites at the central uplift
and in the crater moat, for ground truthing and
comparison with other structures. Within the
framework of an international and multidisciplinary
drilling project led by the International
Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP), 16
drill cores were obtained from June to October 2004
at six locations within Lake Bosumtwi, which is 8.5
kin in diameter. The 14 sediment cores are currently
being investigated for paleoenvironmental
indicators. The two impactite cores LB-07A and
LB-08A were drilled into the deepest section of the
annular moat (540 in) and the flank of the central
uplift (450 in), respectively. They are the main
subject of this special issue of Meteoritics &
Planetary Science, which represents the first
detailed presentations of results from the deep
drilling into the Bosumtwi impactite
sequence. Drilling progressed in both cases through
the impact breccia, layer into fractured
bedrock. LB-07A comprises lithic (in the uppermost
part) and suevitic impact breccias with appreciable
amounts of impact melt fragments. The lithic clast
content is dominated by graywacke, besides various
metapelites, quartzite, and a carbonate target
component. Shock deformation in the form of quartz
grains with planar microdeformations is
abundant. First chemical results indicate a number
of suevite samples that are strongly enriched in
siderophile elements and Mg, but the presence of a
definite meteoritic component in these samples
cannot be confirmed due to high indigenous
values. Core LB-08A comprises suevitic breccia in
the uppermost part, followed with depth by a thick
sequence of graywacke-dominated metasediment with
suevite and a few granitoid dike intercalations. It
is assumed that the metasediment package represents
bedrock intersected in the flank of the central
uplift. Both 7A and 8A suevite intersections differ
from suevites outside of the northern crater rim.
Deep drilling results confirmed the gross structure
of the crater as imaged by the pre-drilling seismic
surveys. Borehole geophysical studies conducted in
the two boreholes confirmed the low seismic
velocities for the post-impact sediments (less than
1800 m/s) and the impactites (2600-3300 m/s). The
impactites exhibit very high porosities (up to 30
vol%), which has important implications for
mechanical rock stability. The statistical analysis
of the velocities and densities reveals a
seismically transparent impactite sequence (free of
prominent internal reflections). Petrophysical core
analyses provide no support for the presence of a
homogeneous magnetic unit (= melt breccia) within
the center of the structure. Borehole vector
magnetic data point to a patchy distribution of
highly magnetic rocks within the impactite sequence.
The lack of a coherent melt sheet, or indeed of any
significant amounts of melt rock in the crater fill,
is in contrast to expectations from modeling and
pre-drilling geophysics, and presents an interesting
problem for comparative studies and requires
re-evaluation of existing data from other
terrestrial impact craters, as well as modeling
parameters.},

multi-decadal fluctuations in ENSO-related activity
building up to the present day. Although these two

   abstract = {A new field of study, ``decadal prediction,\{''\} is
emerging in climate science. Decadal prediction lies
between seasonal/interannual forecasting and
longer-term climate change projections, and focuses
on time-evolving regional climate conditions over
the next 10-30 yr. Numerous assessments of climate
information user needs have identified this time
scale as being important to infrastructure planners,
water resource managers, and many others. It is
central to the information portfolio required to
adapt effectively to and through climatic
changes. At least three factors influence
time-evolving regional climate at the decadal time
scale: 1) climate change commitment (further warming
as the coupled climate system comes into adjustment
with increases of greenhouse gases that have already
occurred), 2) external forcing, particularly from
future increases of greenhouse gases and recovery of
the ozone hole, and 3) internally generated
variability. Some decadal prediction skill has been
demonstrated to arise from the first two of these
factors, and there is evidence that initialized
coupled climate models can capture mechanisms of
internally generated decadal climate variations,
thus increasing predictive skill globally and
particularly regionally. Several methods have been
proposed for initializing global coupled climate
models for decadal predictions, all of which involve
global time-evolving threedimensional ocean data,
including temperature and salinity. An experimental
framework to address decadal
predictability/prediction is described in this paper
and has been incorporated into the coordinated
Coupled Model Intercomparison Model, phase 5 (CMIP5)
experiments, some of which will be assessed for the
IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). These
experiments will likely guide work in this emerging
field over the next 5 yr.},

the zonally symmetric component is caused by
interactions between transient eddies and tropical

Niho events the jets strengthen in each hemisphere
and shift equatorward. Changes in the subtropical
jet influence the transient-eddy momentum fluxes and
the eddy-driven mean meridional circulation. During

midlatitudes of each hemisphere is accompanied by
low-level convergence and brings increased
precipitation. These changes in the transient-eddy

cancel each other and, in Ann, do not contribute to
the zonal-mean precipitation anomalies. Propagation
of anomalous stationary waves disrupts the zonal
symmetry. Flow around the deeper Aleutian Low and
the eastward extension of the Pacific jet stream
supply the moisture for increased precipitation over
the eastern North Pacific and the Western seaboard

convergence supplies the moisture for increased

   abstract = {The "Dust Bowl" drought of the 1930s was highly
unusual for North America, deviating from the
typical pattern forced by "La Nina" with the maximum
drying in the central and northern Plains, warm
temperature anomalies across almost the entire
continent, and widespread dust storms. General
circulation models (GCMs), forced by sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) from the 1930s, produce a
drought, but one that is centered in southwestern
North America and without the warming centered in
the middle of the continent. Here, we show that the
inclusion of forcing from human land degradation
during the period, in addition to the anomalous
SSTs, is necessary to reproduce the anomalous
features of the Dust Bowl drought. The degradation
over the Great Plains is represented in the GCM as a
reduction in vegetation cover and the addition of a
soil dust aerosol source, both consequences of crop
failure. As a result of land surface feedbacks, the
simulation of the drought is much improved when the
new dust aerosol and vegetation boundary conditions
are included. Vegetation reductions explain the high
temperature anomaly over the northern U.S., and the
dust aerosols intensify the drought and move it
northward of the purely ocean-forced drought
pattern. When both factors are included in the model
simulations, the precipitation and temperature
anomalies are of similar magnitude and in a similar
location compared with the
observations. Human-induced land degradation is
likely to have not only contributed to the dust
storms of the 1930s but also amplified the drought,

Murray streamflow to assess present-day variations
in the context of the past two centuries. Nine
annually resolved paleoclimate proxy records from
the Australasian region are used to develop a
reconstruction of streamflow from 1783 to 1988. An
ensemble of reconstructions is presented, providing
probabilistic estimates of River Murray flows for
each year back in time. The best-estimate
reconstruction captures approximately 23% (50%) of
annual (decadal) naturalized streamflow
variability. High and low streamflow phases and
their association with decadal climate variability
in the Pacific are discussed. Reconstructed River
Murray streamflow shows considerable variation since
1783. We estimate that there is a 2.3% chance that
the 1998-2008 record low decadal streamflow deficit
has been exceeded since European
settlement. Stochastic simulations of the decadal
variations in River Murray streamflow are computed
using the paleostreamflow reconstruction to estimate
model parameters. From these simulations, we
estimate that the 1998-2008 streamflow deficit has
an approximate 1 in 1500 year return period. As
climate models are assessed relative to short
instrumental records, future projections of
decadal-scale variations in Murray-Darling Basin
(MDB) streamflow may be inadequately
represented. Given the immense socioeconomic
importance of Australia's "food bowl," future
paleoclimate and modeling efforts should be directed
at understanding variability at this scale. This
would greatly enhance our capacity to estimate
regional sensitivity of the MDB's hydroclimate to
further anthropogenic influences.},

   abstract = {Current vegetation models hold constant the dynamics
of seasonal biospheric changes, neglecting annual
variability. One of these features, the spring
"green wave" (onset of leafing or "green-up") in
midlatitudes, is an example of the complex feedback
loop between the atmosphere and plant communities.
The green wave responds to the atmosphere, but, in
turn, leafing causes rapid changes in the
surface-layer energy budget. Annual variability
tends to obscure the magnitude of the green wave's
effects on conventional climatic records. When
meteorological data are "normalized" to the green
wave (averaged relative to first-leaf phenology data
rather than to calendar date), an actual break in
the spring maximum temperature curve can be
detected. This project examined many surface-level
meteorological variables (at standard shelter
height, representing surface-layer conditions)
during the time of spring leafing in order to detect
other changes and to further analyze the cause,
extent, and persistence of these annual
variations. The results show that the green wave
occurs in conjunction with discontinuities (signals)
in lower-atmospheric lapse rate, surface vapor
pressure, relative humidity, visibility, and V wind
component. These signals are consistent with the
start of plant photosynthetic activity, seasonal
shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns, and
physical changes in the nature of the surface
layer. A parameter from simple green-wave models
that identifies seasonal changes in the lower
atmosphere may be useful in operational forecasting
and GCM simulations that link the atmosphere and
biosphere.},

Varve thicknesses relate most strongly to total annual discharge (r2=0.75, n=43, p<0.0001). Maximum annual grain size depends most strongly on maximum spring daily discharge (r2=0.63, n=43, p<0.0001) and maximum annual daily discharge (r2=0.61, n=43, p<0.0001), while varve thickness is poorly correlated with maximum annual grain size (r2=0.004, n=287, p=0.33). Relations between varve thickness and annual climate variables (temperature, precipitation, North Pacific (NP) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) indices) are insignificant. On multidecadal timescales, however, regime shifts in varve thickness and total annual discharge coincide with shifts in NP and PDO indices. Periods with increased varve thickness and total annual discharge were associated with warm PDO phases and a strengthened Aleutian Low. The varve-inferred record of PDO suggests that any periodicity in the PDO varied over time, and that the early 19th century marked a transition to a more frequent or detectable shifts.},

Such paleoclimate proxies have demonstrated significant multidecadal climate variability in the Atlantic sector since at least the mid-1700s. However, Atlantic multidecadal climate variability is primarily defined by fluctuations in sea surface temperature (SST) and the proxy evidence comes from a variety of sources, many of which are terrestrial and are not directly recording sea surface temperature. Further analysis into the causes and consequences of Atlantic multidecadal climate variability requires development of a spatial network of decadal resolution proxy SST records with both low and high latitude contributions. An initial attempt at a low latitude Atlantic SST reconstruction found only 4 sites with ≤5year resolution data, demonstrating the paucity of appropriate data available. The 4-site average correlated significantly with instrumental average SST and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The full record, 1360–2000C.E., and a shortened version 1460–1850C.E., had significant multidecadal variability centered at a 60-year period. Comparing our reconstruction with reconstructions of SST anomalies in the North Atlantic shows that there is no consensus yet on the history of Atlantic multidecadal variability.},

One limitation of that recent study was the relatively small number of hybrid zones available for mapping. In this study, we search for evidence of clustering of contact zones between closely related taxa using data not only from hybrid zones but from species range maps of trees, birds, and mammals and from the position of phylogeographic breaks within species. Digital geographic range maps and a geographic information system approach allowed for accurate and rapid mapping of distributional data. Areas of contact between closely related species and phylogeographic breaks within species clustered into areas characterized by common physiographic features or predicted by previously hypothesized glacial refugia. The results underscore the general importance of geographic barriers to dispersal (mountain chains) and climate change (periods of cooling alternating with periods of warming, which lead to the contraction and expansion of species ranges) in species evolution.},

A network of recently developed tree-ring chronologies for Southern and Baja California extends the instrumental record and reveals decadal-scale variability back to 1661. The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) is closely matched by the dominant mode of tree-ring variability that provides a preliminary view of multiannual climate fluctuations spanning the past four centuries. The reconstructed PDO index features a prominent bidecadal oscillation, whose amplitude weakened in the late l700s to mid-1800s. A comparison with proxy records of ENSO suggests that the greatest decadal-scale oscillations in Pacific climate between 1706 and 1977 occurred around 1750, 1905, and 1947.},

extratropical circulation in both hemispheres are
characterized by deep, zonally symmetric or
"annular" structures, with geopotential height
perturbations of opposing signs in the polar cap
region and in the surrounding zonal ring centered
near 45 degrees latitude. The structure and dynamics
of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode have
been extensively documented, whereas the existence
of a Northern Hemisphere (NH) mode, herein referred
to as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), has only recently
been recognized. Like the SH mode, the AO can be
defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function
of the sea level pressure field or of the zonally
symmetric geopotential height or zonal wind
fields. In this paper the; structure and seasonality
of the NH and SH modes are compared based on data
from the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research
reanalysis and supplementary datasets. The
structures of the NH and SH annular modes are shown
to be remarkably similar, not only in the zonally
averaged geopotential height and zonal wind fields,
but in the mean meridional circulations as
well. Both exist year-round in the troposphere, but
they amplify with height upward into the
stratosphere during those seasons in which the
strength of the zonal flow is conducive to strong
planetary wave-mean how interaction: midwinter in
the NH and late spring in the SH. During these
"active seasons," the annular modes modulate the
strength of the Lagrangian mean circulation in the
lower stratosphere, total column ozone and
tropopause height over mid- and high latitudes, and
the strength of the trade winds of their respective
hemispheres. The NH mode also contains an embedded
planetary wave signature with expressions in surface
air temperature, precipitation, total column ozone,
and tropopause height. It is argued that the
horizontal temperature advection by the perturbed
zonal-mean zonal wind field in the lower troposphere
is instrumental in forcing this pattern. A
companion paper documents the striking resemblance
between the structure of the annular modes and
observed climate trends over the past few decades.},

The authors investigate the nature of the seasonal precipitation changes in AGCM experiments forced by SST perturbations, which represent idealizations of the changes in annual mean, amplitude, and phase as simulated by CMIP5 models. A uniform SST warming is sufficient to force both amplification and a delay of the annual cycle of precipitation. The amplification is due to an increase in the annual mean vertical water vapor gradient, while the delay is affected by changes in the seasonality of the circulation. A budget analysis of this simulation reveals a large degree of similarity with the CMIP5 results. In...},

   abstract = {The response of the tropical Pacific Ocean to future
climate change remains highly uncertain, in part
because of the disagreement among observations and
coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) regarding
20th-century trends. Here we use forward models of
climate proxies to compare CGCM simulations and
proxy observations to address 20th-century trends
and assess remaining uncertainties in both proxies
and models. We model coral oxygen isotopic
composition (delta O-18) in a 23-site Indo-Pacific
network as a linear function of sea-surface
temperature (SST) and sea-surface salinity (SSS)
obtained from historical marine observations
(instrumental data) and a multimodel ensemble of
20th-century CGCM output. When driven with
instrumental data from 1958 to 1990, the forward
modeled corals (pseudocorals) capture the spatial
pattern and temporal evolution of the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Comparison of the
linear trend observed in corals and instrumental
pseudocorals suggests that the trend in corals
between 1958 and 1990 results from both warming
(60%) and freshening (40%). From 1890 to 1990, the
warming/freshening trend in CGCM pseudocorals is
weaker than that observed in corals. Corals display
a moderate trend towards a reduced zonal SST
gradient and decreased ENSO-related variance between
1895 and 1985, whereas CGCM pseudocorals display a
range of trend patterns and an increase in
ENSO-related variance over the same
period. Differences between corals and CGCM
pseudocorals may arise from uncertainties in the
linear bivariate coral model, uncertainties in the
way corals record climate, undersensitivity of CGCMs
to radiative forcing during the 20th century, and/or
biases in the simulated CGCM SSS fields. Citation:

to be the source region of a substantial proportion
of the world's inter-annual climate variability,
including the globally significant El Nino-Southern
Oscillation. Here new data are presented on changes
in the climate of this region over the past 70 yr,
based on analysis of the stable oxygen isotopic
composition of annually banded, massive corals
living on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. In
this area, the coincidence of abundant and
isotopically light rainfall with small seasonal and
inter-annual changes in temperature means that the
coral skeletal delta(18)O record may be reliably
interpreted in terms of rainfall variation. Since
the abundance of rainfall is governed by the
intensity of deep atmospheric convection, the coral
records provide regionally significant, and
regionally reproducible, climatic indices. In
particular, the coral records indicate larger
changes in the degree of coupling of the climate of
the region with the Southern Oscillation than have
hitherto been described. These changes in coupling,
which accompany shifts in the dominant periodicities
of inter-annual climate variation, are indicative of
rapid and large-scale reorganisation of
ocean-atmosphere interactions. The data indicate
that from the 1920s to 1950s the western equatorial
Pacific was less important in modulating Pacific and
global inter-annual climatic variability than it has
appeared to be subsequently. The reproducibility of
the coral climate records, combined with the
presence on the north coast of Papua New Guinea of
extensive and well preserved raised reef terraces,
leads to the potential for extending understanding
of climatic variability in this globally important

circulation model, the climate impacts of a
basin-scale warming or cooling of the North Atlantic
Ocean are investigated. Multidecadal fluctuations
with this pattern were observed during the twentieth
century, and similar variations-but with larger
amplitude-are believed to have occurred in the more
distant past. It is found that in all seasons the
response to warming the North Atlantic is strongest,
in the sense of highest signal-to-noise ratio, in
the Tropics. However there is a large seasonal cycle
in the climate impacts. The strongest response is
found in boreal summer and is associated with
suppressed precipitation and elevated temperatures
over the lower-latitude parts of North and South
America. In August-September-October there is a
significant reduction in the vertical shear in the
main development region for Atlantic hurricanes. In
winter and spring, temperature anomalies over land
in the extratropics are governed by dynamical
changes in circulation rather than simply reflecting
a thermodynamic response to the warming or cooling
of the ocean. The tropical climate response is
primarily forced by the tropical SST anomalies, and
the major features are in line with simple models of
the tropical circulation response to diabatic
heating anomalies. The extratropical climate
response is influenced both by tropical and
higher-latitude SST anomalies and exhibits nonlinear
sensitivity to the sign of the SST
forcing. Comparisons with multidecadal changes in
sea level pressure observed in the twentieth century
support the conclusion that the impact of North
Atlantic SST change is most important in summer, but
also suggest a significant influence in lower
latitudes in autumn and winter. Significant climate
impacts are not restricted to the Atlantic basin,
implying that the Atlantic Ocean could be an
important driver of global decadal variability. The
strongest remote impacts are found to occur in the
tropical Pacific region in June-August and
September-November. Surface anomalies in this region
have the potential to excite coupled
ocean-atmosphere feedbacks, which are likely to play
an important role in shaping the ultimate climate

test for recent models of the interaction between
the Asian monsoon and the tropical ocean, because
various feedback mechanisms should result in
characteristic regional patterns of
variability. Although the instrumental record of
climate variability in the tropics is essentially
limited to the last few decades, the stable isotopic
composition of living corals provides an effective
means for extending the instrumental
observations. Here we present two coral isotopic
records from the Indonesian Maritime Continent, and
we use these records with other previously published
records to describe: (i) the relationship between
western Pacific and central Pacific climate
variability over the past century, with special
emphasis on the biennial band; and (ii) the strength
of the west-east 'Indian Ocean Dipole'. We find that
the amplitude of the biennial cycle in the Pacific
did not vary inversely with the strength of ENSO (El
Nino Southern Oscillation), as might be expected
from some models of monsoonal feedback on the
central Pacific. Instead, the biennial variability
was modulated on decadal timescales throughout much
of the Pacific. We also show that the zonal oxygen
isotopic gradient in the Indian Ocean coral records
was significantly correlated with central Pacific
sea surface temperature on a variety of
timescales. Thus, it is likely that this 'coral
dipole' was a product of strong ENSO-like
teleconnections over the Indian Ocean, as opposed to
being the result of unique Indian Ocean or monsoonal
dynamics. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

potential temperature, and neutral density from
historical archives and the international Argo
Program, this study develops the three-dimensional
field of multidecadal linear change for ocean-state
properties. The period of analysis extends from 1950
to 2008, taking care to minimize the aliasing
associated with the seasonal and major global El
Nino Southern Oscillation modes. Large, robust, and
spatially coherent multidecadal linear trends in
salinity to 2000-dbar depth are found. Salinity
increases at the sea surface are found in
evaporation-dominated regions and freshening in
precipitation-dominated regions, with the spatial
pattern of change strongly resembling that of the
mean salinity field, consistent with an
amplification of the global hydrological
cycle. Subsurface salinity changes on pressure
surfaces are attributable to both isopycnal heave
and real water-mass modification of the
temperature-salinity relationship. Subduction and
circulation by the ocean's mean flow of surface
salinity and temperature anomalies appear to account
for most regional subsurface salinity changes on
isopycnals. Broad-scale surface warming and the
associated poleward migration of isopycnal outcrops
drive a clear and repeating pattern of subsurface
isopycnal salinity change in each independent ocean
basin. Qualitatively, the observed global
multidecadal salinity changes are thus consonant
with both broad-scale surface warming and the
amplification of the global hydrological cycle.},

indicating that the drought conditions were likely
of natural origin. For the period 2000-49, the
ensemble mean of the forced experiments yields a wet

consistent with a projected warming of the North

relations and to develop worst-case scenarios for
the future. In particular, during the medieval
period, similar to AD 900-1300, the Northern
Hemisphere experienced temperatures warmer than all
but the most recent decades. Paleoclimatic and model
data indicate increased temperatures in western
North America of approximately 1 degrees C over the
long-term mean. This was a period of extensive and
persistent aridity over western North
America. Paleoclimatic evidence suggests drought in

duration, and extent of subsequent droughts. The
driest decade of this drought was anomalously warm,
though not as warm as the late 20th and early 21st

arid conditions suggests the mid-12th century may
serve as a conservative analogue for severe droughts
that might occur in the future. The severity,
extent, and persistence of the 12th century drought
that occurred under natural climate variability,
have important implications for water resource

Our results indicate that during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (900-1300 AD) the Pacific Northwest experienced exceptional wetness in winter and that during the Little Ice Age (LIA) (1450-1850 AD) conditions were drier, contrasting with hydroclimatic anomalies in the desert Southwest and consistent with climate dynamics related to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

the past 100 years. However, paleoclimatic records
indicate that the region is also prone to much
longer droughts, including a prolonged episode of
generally and conditions and severe droughts
extending from the 9th through 14th centuries. This
period is sometimes referred to as the medieval
climate anomaly. Archaeological evidence suggests
that prehistoric populations such as the Anasazi in
the Southwest and the Chumash in southern California
were impacted by mega-drought conditions during the
medieval climate anomaly. These groups appear to
have displayed a variety of responses-ranging from
increased violence and the abandonment of some
regions, to the development of greater cultural
complexity and material
infrastructure. Paleoclimatological and
paleooceanographic data indicate that the and
conditions in western North America during the
medieval climate anomaly were produced by the
prolonged occurrence of cool surface waters in the
eastern Pacific. Recent climate model experiments
suggest relatively small increases in insolation and
decreases in atmospheric volcanic emission
concentrations can trigger such depressions of
eastern Pacific temperatures. It is thus possible
that a similar event could occur in the future due
to natural or anthropogenic causes. (c) 2007

@article{tourre99_interdecadal,
   abstract = {Interdecadal variability in sea level pressure (SLP)
and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the
Pacific Ocean was "quasiperiodic" from 1900-91. The
coherent variability of this phenomenon is
investigated using gridded observational data from
the turn of the century (SST and SLP) and of upper
ocean heat content (HS) from the recent two and a
half decades. The nominal cycle in atmosphere-ocean
variables is roughly two decades long, but growth
and decay can happen on a shorter timescale (e.g.,
half a cycle or so). The authors divide the full
cycle into four phases: An onset phase, during which
a weak SLP anomaly pattern off Japan takes
approximately 2-4 yr to expand eastward, leads to
large SLP anomalies in the region of the Aleutian
low. A quasistationary growth phase, with the
midlatitude SLP anomaly pattern in the eastern
ocean, intensifies over a 2-4 yr period. The
persistent SLP anomalies evolve in concert with
large SST (and HS anomalies) of the same polarity
located to the south-southwest along the subarctic
frontal zone (SAFZ). During the growth phase, SST
anomalies with opposite polarity develop to the
east, associated with anomalous atmospheric
circulation along the North American coastline. Near
the end of the growth phase a narrow tongue of
enhanced SST anomalies is found along the
subtropical front near Hawaii, slightly to the west
of the subduction region associated with the
subtropical gyre. Following is a decay phase during
which the midocean SST and SLP anomalies weaken,
while the HS anomalies persist in the southern part
of the subtropical gyre. Concomitantly, a weak
anomalous east-west SLP gradient is established in
the tropical Pacific and could contribute to the
interdecadal variability of the southern oscillation
index. Finally, a return phase occurs (identical to
the onset phase but with opposite polarity), during
which SST anomalies move from the Alaskan gyre and
from the center of the subtropical gyre to merge
onto the SAFZ. During the evolution of the
interdecadal phenomenon, the overall structure of
IIS highlights the notion that the subtropical gyre
integrates the thermal and dynamical forcing induced
by the persistent surface circulation anomaly. Since
only the oceanic anomalies retain their character
throughout the seasonal cycle, the interdecadal
phenomenon may owe its existence to coupled
ocean-atmosphere interaction in which ocean surface
anomalies feed back on the atmosphere providing the
necessary links between consecutive winter
seasons. It is suggested that this can occur through
interactions in either midlatitudes
(delayed-negative feedback) and/or the Tropics.},

physical understanding of the future climate change
enhance confidence in the predictions. The regional
model ensembles produce consistent precipitation
projections over much of northern tropical Africa. A
moisture budget analysis is used to identify the
circulation changes that support future
precipitation anomalies. The projected midsummer
drought over the Guinean Coast region is related
partly to weakened monsoon flow. Since the rainfall
maximum demonstrates a southward bias in the control
simulation in July-August, this may be indicative of
future summer drying over the Sahel. Wetter
conditions in late summer over the Sahel are
associated with enhanced moisture transport by the
West African westerly jet, a strengthening of the
jet itself, and moisture transport from the
Mediterranean. Severe drought in East Africa during
August and September is accompanied by a weakened
Indian monsoon and Somali jet. Simulations with
projected and idealized SST forcing suggest that
overall SST warming in part supports this regional
model ensemble agreement, although changes in SST
gradients are important over West Africa in spring

individual climate forcings suggest that the spatial

controlled by the anomalous SST and lateral boundary

analysis to characterize the space-time variability
of fall precipitation over the United States from
1895 to 2004. MTM-SVD analysis of precipitation
demonstrates the presence of statistically
significant secular and decadal signals. The decadal
signal in fall precipitation, with a period of
approximately 12 years, is large and spatially
correlated across most of the central United

in magnitude after 1950, the period when many
previous studies have identified large linear
trends. Linear trends in fall precipitation are
found to be more spatially consistent with the
pattern of decadal variations than the secular
variations, suggesting that increasing decadal
variations in precipitation after 1950 have
contributed to large linear trends reported by
several previous studies. Our results suggest that
the strong spatial correlation in decadal

controls on the area burned by. re in different
vegetation types in the western United States. We
demonstrate that wild. re area burned (WFAB) in the
American West was controlled by climate during the
20th century (1916-2003). Persistent
ecosystem-specific correlations between climate and
WFAB are grouped by vegetation type
(ecoprovinces). Most mountainous ecoprovinces
exhibit strong year-of-fire relationships with low
precipitation, low Palmer drought severity index
(PDSI), and high temperature. Grass-and
shrub-dominated ecoprovinces had positive
relationships with antecedent precipitation or
PDSI. For 1977-2003, a few climate variables explain
33-87% (mean = 64%) of WFAB, indicating strong
linkages between climate and area burned. For
1916-2003, the relationships are weaker, but climate
explained 25-57% (mean = 39%) of the
variability. The variance in WFAB is proportional to
the mean squared for different data sets at
different spatial scales. The importance of
antecedent climate (summer drought in forested
ecosystems and antecedent winter precipitation in
shrub and grassland ecosystems) indicates that the
mechanism behind the observed. re-climate
relationships is climatic preconditioning of large
areas of low fuel moisture via drying of existing
fuels or fuel production and drying. The impacts of
climate change on. re regimes will therefore vary
with the relative energy or water limitations of

between ecologically imprecise state-level and
localized gridded fire data. The differences in
climate . re relationships among the ecoprovinces
underscore the need to consider ecological context

identify specific climate drivers of WFAB. Despite
the possible influence of. re suppression,
exclusion, and fuel treatment, WFAB is still
substantially controlled by climate. The
implications for planning and management are that
future WFAB and adaptation to climate change will
likely depend on ecosystem-specific, seasonal

extratropics owing to a paucity of proxy data in

coral-based reconstruction of sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) for the whole of the tropics (30
degrees N-30 degrees S). It was developed from 14
disparate coral records located in the Indian and
Pacific oceans. Over the most replicated period, the
reconstruction explains 57% of the tropical SST
variance. However, the strength of this signal
weakens markedly as the number of coral records
decreases. The reconstruction is robust between 1850

as the mid 18th century. These results suggest that
ambiguities in the low frequency domain of delta
O-18 measurements can be partially overcome by
pooling together multiple time series from different
locations around the tropics. Agreement with
simulations from two general circulation models
indicates that the late 20th century is likely the
warmest period in the tropics for the last 250
years, and that this recent warming can only be
explained by anthropogenic forcing. The high
frequency variability is dominated by the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation. The reconstruction, owing
to the small number of coral records, is
unfortunately restricted both in time and

the palaeoclimate community to develop new and
longer proxy series to improve the current meager

records are not stationary; during the past 2740 yr,

intervals between droughts ranged from 80 to 230

Mexico indicates that severe droughts associated
with Anasazi withdrawal from Chaco Canyon at 820 cal
yr BP (calendar years before present) and final
abandonment of Chaco Canyon, Mesa Verde, and the
Kayenta area at 650 cal yr BP may have impacted much
of the western United States. During the middle
Holocene (informally defined in this paper as
extending from 8000 to 3000 cal yr BP), magnetic
susceptibility values of sediments deposited in
Pyramid Lake's deep basin were much larger than
late-Holocene (3000-0 cal yr BP) values, indicating
the presence of a shallow take. In addition, the
mean delta(18)O value of CaCO3 precipitated between
6500 and 3430 cal yr BP was 1.6parts per thousand
less than the mean value of CaCO3 precipitated after
2740 cal yr BP. Numerical calculations indicate that
the shift in the delta(18)O baseline probably
resulted from a transition to a wetter (> 30%) and
cooler (3-5degreesC) climate. The existence of a
relatively dry and warm middle-Holocene climate in
the Truckee River-Pyramid Lake system is generally
consistent with archeological, sedimentological,
chemical, physical, and biological records from
various sites within the Great Basin of the western
United States. Two high-resolution Holocene-climate
records are now available from the Pyramid and Owens
lake basins which suggest that the Holocene was
characterized by five climatic intervals. TIC and
6180 records from Owens Lake indicate that the first
interval in the early Holocene (11,600 10,000 cal yr
BP) was characterized by a drying trend that was
interrupted by a brief (200 yr) wet oscillation
centered at 10,300 cal yr BP. This was followed by a
second early-Holocene interval (10,000-8000 cal yr
BP) during which relatively wet conditions
prevailed. During the early part of the middle
Holocene (8000-6500 cal yr BP), high-amplitude

   abstract = {A wide range of hydrological cycles and general
circulations was simulated with an idealized general
circulation model (GCM) by varying the optical
thickness of the longwave absorber. While the
idealized GCM does not capture the full complexity
of the hydrological cycle, the wide range of
climates simulated allows the systematic development
and testing of theories of how precipitation and
moisture transport change as the climate
changes. The simulations show that the character of
the response of the hydrological cycle to variations
in longwave optical thickness differs in different
climate regimes. The global-mean precipitation
increases linearly with surface temperature for
colder climates, but it asymptotically approaches a
maximum at higher surface temperatures. The basic
features of the precipitation-temperature relation,
including the rate of increase in the linear regime,
are reproduced in radiative-convective equilibrium
simulations. Energy constraints partially account
for the precipitation-temperature relation but are
not quantitatively accurate. Large-scale
condensation is most important in the midlatitude
storm tracks, and its behavior is accounted for
using a stochastic model of moisture advection and
condensation. The precipitation associated with
large-scale condensation does not scale with mean
specific humidity, partly because the condensation
region moves upward and meridionally as the climate
warms, and partly because the mean condensation rate
depends on isentropic specific humidity gradients,
which do not scale with the specific humidity
itself. The local water vapor budget relates local
precipitation to evaporation and meridional moisture
fluxes, whose scaling in the subtropics and
extratropics is examined. A delicate balance between
opposing changes in evaporation and moisture flux
divergence holds in the subtropical dry zones. The
extratropical precipitation maximum follows the
storm track in warm climates but lies equatorward of
the storm track in cold climates.},

tropical rainforests has become one of the iconic
images of the impacts of twenty-first century
environmental change and may be one of our century's
most profound legacies. In the Amazon region, the
direct threat of deforestation and degradation is
now strongly intertwined with an indirect challenge
we are just beginning to understand: the possibility
of substantial regional drought driven by global
climate change. The Amazon region hosts more than
half of the world's remaining tropical forests, and
some parts have among the greatest concentrations of
biodiversity found anywhere on Earth. Overall, the
region is estimated to host about a quarter of all
global biodiversity. It acts as one of the major
'flywheels' of global climate, transpiring water and
generating clouds, affecting atmospheric circulation
across continents and hemispheres, and storing
substantial reserves of biomass and soil
carbon. Hence, the ongoing degradation of Amazonia
is a threat to local climate stability and a
contributor to the global atmospheric climate change
crisis. Conversely, the stabilization of Amazonian
deforestation and degradation would be an
opportunity for local adaptation to climate change,
as well as a potential global contributor towards
mitigation of climate change. However, addressing
deforestation in the Amazon raises substantial
challenges in policy, governance, sustainability and
economic science. This paper introduces a theme

these challenges.},

reflect native-species responses and atmospheric

diverse climates, and within a group of stations in
the state of Oklahoma, which has moderate climate
variations across an east-to-west gradient. The
results show that the onset of spring in
midlatitudes is a modally abrupt (rather than
gradual) seasonal transition in terms of energy
balance (sensible and latent heat levels) and
carbon-flux change that can be linked directly to
vegetation phenology. The consistent temporal
pattern and magnitude of flux variations across
diverse sites suggest that this technique has

an increase in the length of the dry season. Our

   abstract = {Mechanisms for El Nino-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO)-like decadal (7-35 years) variability are
analyzed using observational data. When a decadal
positive temperature anomaly occurs in the eastern
tropical Pacific, the atmospheric response excites
negative wind stress curl in the western tropical
South Pacific, which causes the thermocline to shoal
and induce a negative temperature anomaly there. The
cold anomaly moves northwestward to the western and
central equatorial region and then turns eastward
along the equator to reverse the original
temperature anomaly in the east. The eastward
propagation of the oceanic signal along the
equatorial thermocline correlates with a zonal wind
anomaly. The cold anomaly in the east grows through
tropical air-sea interaction and induces a positive
wind stress curl, in the western tropical South
Pacific associated with the atmospheric
teleconnection in the Southern
Hemisphere. Subsequent evolution of the negative
phase is similar to that of the positive phase. The
complete scenario for this ENSO-like decadal
variability due to the air-sea interaction processes
within the tropics has a period of similar to 14
years. We also discuss ENSO-like variation on the
interdecadal (> 35 years) timescale, with possible
relationship to the 1976-1977 climate regime shift.},

   abstract = {Droughts can be characterized by their severity,
frequency and duration, and areal extent. Depth-area
duration analysis, widely used to characterize
precipitation extremes, provides a basis for the
evaluation of drought severity when storm depth is
replaced by an appropriate measure of drought
severity. Gridded precipitation and temperature data
were used to force a physically based macroscale
hydrologic model at 1/2 degrees spatial resolution
over the continental United States, and construct a
drought history from 1920 to 2003 based on the
model-simulated soil moisture and runoff. A
clustering algorithm was used to identify individual
drought events and their spatial extent from monthly
summaries of the simulated data. A series of
severity-area-duration (SAD) curves were constructed
to relate the area of each drought to its
severity. An envelope of the most severe drought
events in terms of their SAD characteristics was
then constructed. The results show that (a) the
droughts of the 1930s and 1950s were the most severe
of the twentieth century for large areas; (b) the
early 2000s drought in the western United States is
among the most severe in the period of record,
especially for small areas and short durations; (c)
the most severe agricultural droughts were also
among the most severe hydrologic droughts, however,
the early 2000s western U. S. drought occupies a
larger portion of the hydrologic drought envelope
curve than does its agricultural companion; and (d)
runoff tends to recover in response to precipitation
more quickly than soil moisture, so the severity of
hydrologic drought during the 1930s and 1950s was
dampened by short wet spells, while the severity of
the early 2000s drought remained high because of the
relative absence of these short-term phenomena.},

tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is
investigated using the Zebiak-Cane coupled
ocean-atmosphere model. The model is forced with a
uniform heating, or cooling, varying between +/-40 W
m(-2) into the ocean surface. a new climatological
SST pattern is established for which the
area-averaged temperature change is smaller in
magnitude than the imposed forcing. The forcing is
balanced almost equally by a change in the heat flux
out of the ocean and by vertical advection of heat
in the ocean through anomalous equatorial ocean
upwelling. The generation of anomalous upwelling is
identified here as a possible mechanism capable of
regulating tropical SSTs. This ocean dynamical
thermostat mechanism has a seasonally varying
efficiency that causes amplification (weakening) of
the seasonal cycle for the heating (cooling). The
interannual variability also changes under the
imposed forcing. These results suggest that the role
of ocean dynamics should be included in any
discussion of the regulation of the tropical
climate.},

   abstract = {This article applies formal detection and
attribution techniques to investigate the nature of
observed shifts in the timing of streamflow in the
western United States. Previous studies have shown
that the snow hydrology of the western United States
has changed in the second half of the twentieth
century. Such changes manifest themselves in the
form of more rain and less snow, in reductions in
the snow water contents, and in earlier snowmelt and
associated advances in streamflow ``center'' timing
(the day in the ``water-year'' on average when half
the water-year flow at a point has passed). However,
with one exception over a more limited domain, no
other study has attempted to formally attribute
these changes to anthropogenic increases of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using the
observations together with a set of global climate
model simulations and a hydrologic model (applied to
three major hydrological regions of the western
United States-the California region, the upper
Colorado River basin, and the Columbia River basin),
it is found that the observed trends toward earlier
``center'' timing of snowmelt-driven streamflows in
the western United States since 1950 are detectably
different from natural variability (significant at
the p < 0.05 level). Furthermore, the nonnatural
parts of these changes can be attributed confidently
to climate changes induced by anthropogenic
greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, and land use. The
signal from the Columbia dominates the analysis, and
it is the only basin that showed a detectable signal
when the analysis was performed on individual
basins. It should be noted that although climate
change is an important signal, other climatic
processes have also contributed to the hydrologic
variability of large basins in the western United
States.},

combined with the World Soil Data File [Zobler,

data set of variations in physical properties
throughout the soil profile. These properties are
important in the determination of water storage in
individual soil horizons and exchange of water with
the lower atmosphere within global climate
models. We have used these data sets, in conjunction
with the Matthews [1983] global vegetation data set
and texture-based estimates of available soil
moisture, to calculate the global distributions of
soil profile thickness, potential storage of water
in the soil profile, potential storage of water in
the root zone, and potential storage of water
derived from soil texture. Comparisons with the
water-holding capacities used in the GISS Model II
show that our derived values for potential storage
of water are consistently larger than those
previously used in the GISS GCM. Preliminary
analyses suggest that incorporation of this data set
into the GISS GCM has improved the model's
performance by including more realistic variability

   abstract = {A 3000-year varve-thickness record from Hvítárvatn, a glacier-dominated lake in central Iceland, preserves inter-annual variations in the delivery of glacially eroded sediment to the lake. The first-order low-frequency trend in varve thickness reflects increased glacial erosion through the Late Holocene, reaching a peak during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Superimposed on this trend are large inter-annual to decadal fluctuations in varve thickness that we suggest reflect variability in climate parameters that determine the efficiency of the fluvial transport system to deliver glacially eroded sediment to the lake each year. We use spectral analysis to test whether regular high-frequency cyclicity in varve thickness exists in the 3-ka record after removing the low-frequency variability. Spectral analyses from three sediment cores recovered from the lake show essentially the same periods of 2.8–3.4, 13, 35–40 and 85–93, for the overlapping ∼900-year period. Additionally, cycles of 55, 130 and 290 years are found in the spectrum for the 3000-year record that do not show up in the spectra for the shorter cores. Some of these cycles show similar variability to those of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). This relationship is supported by a significant correlation between varve thickness and both the NAO (precipitation) and AMO (summer temperature) indices over the 180-year instrumental period. NAO cyclicities (2–15 years) are weakly expressed in the first half of the record, increase between 600 and 1000 AD, decrease in strength during medieval time, and are most strongly expressed between 1300 AD and the early 20th century. AMO cyclicities (50 to 130 years) are also relatively weak in the first half of the record, becoming quite strong between 600 and 1000 AD and again between 1100 and 1500 AD, but are essentially absent through the peak of the LIA, between 1500 and 1900 AD, a time when strong cyclicities of about 35 years appear.},

drier than the preceding millennium. A weaker

@article{mickler06,
   abstract = {The application of stable isotopes in speleothem
records requires an understanding of the extent to
which speleothem calcite isotopic compositions
reflect the compositions of the cave waters from
which they precipitate. To test for equilibrium
precipitation, modern speleothem calcite was grown
on glass plates, so that the carbon and oxygen
isotope composition of the calcite and the water
from which it precipitated could be directly
compared. The plates were placed on the tops of
three actively growing stalagmites that occupy a 1
m(2) area in Harrison's Cave, Barbados, West
Indies. Only some of the plate delta(13)C values and
none of the plate delta(18)O values correspond to
equilibrium values, indicating significant kinetic
isotope effects during speleothem calcite growth. We
investigate herein mechanisms that may account for
the kinetic isotope effects. On each plate,
speleothem calcite was deposited with distinct
delta(18)O and delta(13)C compositions that increase
progressively away from the growth axis, with up to
6.6 parts per thousand C-13 and 1.7 parts per
thousand O-18 enrichments. The positive delta(13)C
versus delta(18)O trends are likely a result of O-18
and C-13 Rayleigh-distillation enrichment in the
HCO3- reservoir owing to progressive CO2 degassing
and CaCO3 precipitation. The magnitude of the
delta(13)C versus 8180 slope is likely controlled by
the extent to which CO2 hydration-hydroxylation
reactions buffer the oxygen isotope composition of
the HCO3- reservoir during calcite
precipitation. Complete oxygen isotopic buffering of
the HCO3- reservoir by CO2 hydration-hydroxylation
reactions will produce a vertical delta(13)C versus
delta(18)O slope in calcite sampled along a growth
layer. As oxygen isotope buffering of the HCO3-
reservoir decreases to no buffering, the delta(13)C
versus delta(13)O slope in calcite sampled along a
growth layer will decrease from vertical to 0.52 at
the cave temperature. In this study, modern
speleothem calcite sampled along the growth layer
produced a delta(13)C versus delta(18)O slope of
3.9, indicating incomplete oxygen isotope buffering
of the HCO3- reservoir during calcite precipitation.
Both modern and Holocene speleothem calcite from
Barbados, sampled temporally along the growth axis,
shows similar positive delta(13)C versus delta(18)O
slopes. These results, along with the spatial
variations in glass plate calcite carbon and oxygen
isotope compositions, suggest that the isotopic
composition of the Holocene speleothems is in part
controlled by non-equilibrium isotope effects. In
addition, there is a correlation between stalactite
length and oxygen and carbon isotope ratios of
calcite precipitated on the corresponding stalagmite
and glass plate, which may be due to C-13 and O-18
enrichment of the HCO3- reservoir during CO,
degassing-calcite precipitation along the
overhanging stalactite. We compiled 165 published
speleothem stable isotope records with a global
distribution and found that most of these records
show a positive covariation between delta(13)C and
delta(18)O values. Speleothem stable isotope records
may be influenced by kinetic isotope effects such
that temperature-controlled equilibrium
fractionation models alone cannot directly explain
the significance of the variations in these
records. Advancing the interpretation of these
records requires the calibration of cave
environmental conditions with the nonequilibrium
isotope effects that cause delta(13)C and delta(18)O
covariations in speleothems.},

   abstract = {This paper describes the initial work toward the
production of monthly global (land and ocean)
analyses of precipitation for an extended period
from 1948 to the present. Called the precipitation
reconstruction (PREC), the global analyses are
defined by interpolation of gauge observations over
land (PREC/L) and by EOF reconstruction of
historical observations over ocean (PREC/O). This
paper documents the creation of the land component
of the analyses (PREC/L) on a 2.5degrees
latitude/longitude grid for 1948-2000. These
analyses are derived from gauge observations from
over 17 000 stations collected in the Global
Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), version 2,
and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System (CAMS)
datasets. To determine the most suitable objective
analysis procedure for gridding, the analyses
generated by four published objective analysis
techniques [those of Cressman, Barnes, and Shepard,
and the optimal interpolation (OI) method of Gandin]
were compared. The evaluation demonstrated two
crucial points: 1) better results are obtained when
interpolating anomalies rather than the
precipitation totals, and 2) the OI analysis
procedure provided the most accurate and stable
analyses among the four algorithms that were
tested. Based on these results, the OI technique was
used to create monthly gridded analyses of
precipitation over the global land areas for the
53-yr period from 1948 to 2000. In addition, some
diagnostic investigations of the seasonal and
interannual variability of large-scale precipitation
over the global land areas are presented. The mean
distribution and annual cycle of precipitation
observed in the PREC/L showed good agreement with
those in several published gauge-based datasets, and
the anomaly patterns associated with ENSO resemble
those found in previous studies. The gauge-based
dataset (PREC/L) will be updated on a
quasi-real-time basis and is available online
(ftp.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/precip/50-yr).},

the world and this has been a major challenge in
catchments such as the Murray-Darling Basin where
management has focused on increasing agricultural

over-optimistic assessments of available water have
resulted in over-allocation and increasing
ecological decline, which has been severely
exacerbated by record-breaking drought. In recent
years, governments have agreed to radical policies
such as the National Water Initiative 2004 and
allocated substantial funds in
response. Implementation is in gridlock, however, as
the socio-economic implications have become
clearer. Most debate is focused on the draft
Murray-Darling Basin Plan due for release in
mid-2010 before finalization in 2011. It will be the
first Basin-wide plan and is intended to deal with
inequities across borders and risks such as climate
change and drought. Climate change scenarios for
2030 foresee a range of potential surface water
availability outcomes, ranging from a 7% increase
to a 37% decrease, yet greater water scarcity is
being experienced in the current (2002+) drought
with inflows reduced by 70% or more in extreme
years. Contradictory policies are hindering the more
open adaptation required to manage a drier future.},

parts of the main river itself contained only a
fraction of their normal volumes of water, and lakes
were drying up. The consequences for local people,
animals and the forest itself are impossible to

analyses indicate that the drought was manifested as
weak peak river season during autumn to winter as a
consequence of a weak summertime season in
southwestern Amazonia; the winter season was also
accompanied by rainfall that sometimes reached 25%
of the climatic value, being anomalously warm and
dry and helping in the propagation of
fires. Analyses of climatic and hydrological records
in Amazonia suggest a broad consensus that the 2005
drought was linked not to El Nino as with most
previous droughts in the Amazon, but to warming sea
surface temperatures in the tropical North Atlantic

now being considered by water resource management is
extended hydrologic records from tree-ring

by water managers in both quantitative and
qualitative ways, and how tree-ring data are
interpreted in the context of organization mandates

collectively define and examine research and

the potential benefits of reflexive interactions of

in the past, suggests that climate responds to solar
activity. The response mechanisms are thought to be
some combination of direct surface heating, indirect
processes involving UV radiation and the
stratosphere, and modulation of internal climate
system oscillations. A quantitative physical
description is, as yet, lacking to explain the
empirical evidence in terms of the known magnitude
of solar radiative output changes and of climate
sensitivity to these changes. Reproducing
solar-induced decadal climate change requires faster
and larger responses than general circulation models
allow. Nor is the indirect climatic impact of
solar-induced stratospheric change adequately
understood, in part because of uncertainties in the
vertical coupling of the stratosphere and
troposphere. Accounting for solar effects on
pre-industrial surface temperatures requires larger
irradiance variations than present in the
contemporary database, but evidence for significant
secular irradiance change is ambiguous. Essential
for future progress are reliable, extended
observations of the solar radiative output changes
that produce climate forcing. Twenty-five years
after the beginning of continuous monitoring of the
Sun's total radiative output, the Solar Radiation
and Climate Experiment (SORCE) commences a new
generation of solar irradiance measurements with
much expanded capabilities. Relative to historical
solar observations SORCE monitors both total and
spectral irradiance with significantly reduced
uncertainty and increased repeatability, especially
on long time scales. Spectral coverage expands
beyond UV wavelengths to encompass the visible and
near-IR regions that dominate the Sun's radiative
output. The space-based irradiance record, augmented
now with the spectrum of the changes, facilitates
improved characterization of magnetic sources of
irradiance variability, and the detection of
additional mechanisms. This understanding provides a
scientific basis for estimating past and future
irradiance variations, needed for detecting and
predicting climate change.},

The first harmonic is associated with maximum global AAM in winter (December– January–February) and minimum in summer, but the second harmonic is important enough to produce a distinct secondary midwinter minimum. Locally, the second harmonic has largest amplitude in the Tropics and subtropics of the upper troposphere. At present, little is known concerning the fundamental cause of this semiannual variation. The problem is investigated here by focusing on the upper-tropospheric winds, whose angular momentum is an excellent proxy of global AAM. The annual variation of the rotational part of these winds (the part that contributes to the global AAM) is diagnosed in a nonlinear upper-tropospheric vorticity-equation model with specified horizontal wind divergence and transient-eddy forcing.

The effects included are long wave radiation by water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone and the absorption of solar radiation by these three gases. The absorptivities of these gases are determined based upon the recent results of laboratory experiments and those of theoretical computations. The effects of clouds are not included. By use of this scheme the radiative equilibrium temperature is computed for various latitudes and seasons as asymptotic solutions of an initial value problem. To a certain degree the radiative equilibrium solutions reveal some of the typical characteristics of stratospheric temperature and tropopause height variations. Radiative heat budgets of the atmosphere are also computed and compared with the results of the computations of radiative equilibrium. This comparison helpful for understanding the role of radiative processes and also suggests the kinds of effect we should expect from other thermal processes in the atmosphere.},

is an important component of climate and ecological
models. Prior phenological efforts using the
advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) as
a proxy of vegetation dynamics have often simulated
spring events only or failed to simulate interannual
variability. Our aim is to address these
shortcomings and to use the AVHRR to develop
prognostic models for interannual land surface
phenology and, critically, to test whether or not
the developed models are superior to use of
climatological phenology values from the
AVHRR. Using datasets for the conterminous United
States, we first filtered data to select regions and
plant functional types for which the best-possible
remotely sensed signal could be obtained. We then
used a generalized linear model approach to model
the relationship between an integrative productivity
index and estimates of the start of season (SOS) and
end of season (EOS) derived from the AVHRR, yielding
models capable of prognostically predicting SOS/EOS
events independently of satellite data. Mean
absolute errors between the model-predicted and
AVHRR-observed SOS/EOS ranged from 5.1 to 20.3
days. SOS errors were uniformly lower than EOS
errors. SOS models for the deciduous broadleaf
forest and grassland plant functional types produced
lower errors than use of the climatological SOS
values while all other models produced errors higher
than those obtained from the climatological
dates. Based on this criterion for success, we
suggest that the AVHRR may not be appropriate for
further development of prognostic land surface
phenology models. However, an intercomparison of
phenological dates from an independent spring index
model, our model predictions, and the AVHRR
observations indicated that interannual predictions
from our models may be superior to the satellite
data upon which they are based, implying that a
further comparison between models based on the AVHRR

Greenland and Antarctica. The soil moisture fields
are derived from a simulation of the terrestrial
hydrologic cycle driven by a hybrid
reanalysis-observation forcing dataset. Drought is
described in terms of various statistics that
summarize drought duration, intensity, and
severity. There is an overall small wetting trend in
global soil moisture, forced by increasing
precipitation, which is weighted by positive soil
moisture trends over the Western Hemisphere and
especially in North America. Regional variation is
nevertheless apparent, and significant drying over
West Africa, as driven by decreasing Sahel
precipitation, stands out. Elsewhere, Europe appears
to have not experienced significant changes in soil
moisture, a trait shared by Southeast and southern
Asia. Trends in drought duration, intensity, and
severity are predominantly decreasing, but
statistically significant changes are limited in
areal extent, of the order of 1.0%-7.0% globally,
depending on the variable and drought threshold, and
are generally less than 10% of continental
areas. Concurrent changes in drought spatial extent
are evident, with a global decreasing trend of
between -0.021% and -0.035% yr(-1). Regionally,
drought spatial extent over Africa has increased and
is dominated by large increases over West
Africa. Northern and East Asia show positive trends,
and central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau show
decreasing trends. In South Asia all trends are
insignificant. Drought extent over Australia has
decreased. Over the Americas, trends are uniformly
negative and mostly significant. Within the
long-term trends there are considerable interannual
and decadal variations in soil moisture and drought
characteristics for most regions, which impact the
robustness of the trends. Analysis of detrended and
smoothed soil moisture time series reveals that the
leading modes of variability are associated with sea
surface temperatures, primarily in the equatorial
Pacific and secondarily in the North
Atlantic. Despite the overall wetting trend there is
a switch since the 1970s to a drying trend, globally
and in many regions, especially in high northern
latitudes. This is shown to be caused, in part, by
concurrent increasing temperatures. Although drought
is driven primarily by variability in precipitation,
projected continuation of temperature increases

potential for enhanced drought occurrence.},

   abstract = {For the first time a record of total solar
irradiance covering 9300 years is presented, which
covers almost the entire Holocene. This
reconstruction is based on a recently
observationally derived relationship between total
solar irradiance and the open solar magnetic
field. Here we show that the open solar magnetic
field can be obtained from the cosmogenic
radionuclide Be-10 measured in ice cores. Thus,
Be-10 allows to reconstruct total solar irradiance
much further back than the existing record of the
sunspot number which is usually used to reconstruct
total solar irradiance. The resulting increase in
solar-cycle averaged TSI from the Maunder Minimum to
the present amounts to (0.9 +/- 0.4) Wm(-2). In
combination with climate models, our reconstruction
offers the possibility to test the claimed links
between climate and TSI forcing. Citation:

   abstract = {We present a simple, efficient, process-based
forward model of tree-ring growth, called
Vaganov#Shashkin-Lite (VS-Lite), that requires as
inputs only latitude and monthly temperature and
precipitation. Simulations of six bristlecone pine
ring-width chronologies demonstrate the
interpretability of model output as an accurate
representation of the climatic controls on
growth. Ensemble simulations by VS-Lite of two
networks of North American ring-width chronologies
correlate with observations at higher significance
levels on average than simulations formed by
regression of ring width on the principal components
of the same monthly climate data. VS-Lite retains
more skill outside of calibration intervals than
does the principal components regression
approach. It captures the dominant low- and
high-frequency spatiotemporal ring-width signals in
the network with an inhomogeneous, multivariate
relationship to climate. Because continuous
meteorological data are most widely available at
monthly temporal resolution, our model extends the
set of sites at which forward-modeling studies are
possible. Other potential uses of VS-Lite include
generation of synthetic ring-width series for
pseudo-proxy studies, as a data level model in data
assimilation-based climate reconstructions, and for
bias estimation in actual ring-width index series.},

In this study, heading or flowering dates of winter wheat cultivar Kharkof are examined from 70 years of data at six locations in the U.S. Great Plains. Results indicate a consistent trend of earlier heading or flowering dates across all sites, but rates of the trend differ (from 0.8 to 1.8 days per 10-year). Because the heading or flowering date is governed primarily by temperatures, the earlier heading or flowering dates indicate warming temperatures in the spring. Further examinations reveal increase in spring daily minimum temperatures. Findings of this study add a diverse species to the plant community for detecting the “fingerprint” of regional and global climate change.},

   abstract = {This article describes a unique field experiment on Severe Thunderstorms Observations and Regional Modeling (STORM) jointly undertaken by eight South Asian countries. Several pilot field experiments have been conducted so far, and the results are analyzed. The field experiments will continue through 2016. The STORM programme was originally conceived for understanding the Severe Thunderstorms known as Nor'westers that affect West Bengal and the Northeastern parts of India during the pre- monsoon season. The Nor'westers cause loss of human lives and damage to properties worth millions of Dollars annually. Since the neighbouring south Asian countries are also affected by thunderstorms, the STORM programme is expanded to cover the South Asian countries under the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). It covers all the SAARC countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) in 3 phases. Some of the science plans, viz., monitoring life cycle of Nor'westers/ severe thunderstorms, their three dimensional structure, to understand the interrelationship among dynamics, cloud microphysics and electrical properties in the thunderstorm environment are new to the severe weather research. This paper describes the general setting of the field experiment and discusses preliminary results based on the pilot field data. Typical lengths of the squall lines, 2 their intensity, and speed of movements, cloud top temperatures, and their heights are discussed based on the pilot field data. The SAARC STORM programme will complement the Severe Weather Forecast Demonstration Project (SWFDP) of WMO. It would also generate large-scale interest for fuelling research among the scientific community, and broaden the perspectives of operational meteorologists and researchers.},

NCEP–DOE AMIP-II reanalysis covers the “20-year” satellite period of 1979 to the present and uses an updated forecast model, updated data assimilation system, improved diagnostic outputs, and fixes for the known processing problems of the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis. Only minor differences are found in the primary analysis variables such as free atmospheric geopotential height and winds in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, while significant improvements upon NCEP-NCAR reanalysis are made in land surface parameters and land-ocean fluxes. This analysis can be used as a supplement to the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis especially where the original analysis has problems. The differences between the two analyses also provide a measure of uncertainty in current analyses.},

The interface represents a sloping inversion layer coupling the two layers. The shape of the interface can be approximated by a cubic polynomial, and the interfacial coupling condition yields a set of algebraic equations that quantify the scale and intensity of the dammed flow as functions of the external parameters characterizing the environmental conditions. It is found that the cold dome shrinks as the Froude number increases or, to a minor degree, as the Ekman number decreases or/and the upstream inflow veers from northeasterly to southeasterly (with respect to a longitudinal mountain to the west).

   abstract = {Abstract The geostrophic adjustment process for a rotating, stratified atmosphere in the presence of an orographic barrier may be manifest as a phenomenon known as “cold-air damming” (CAD). The degree of blocking by an orographic barrier, and therefore CAD intensity, is related to the static stability of the upstream air mass. When precipitation falls into dry near-surface air, differential evaporational cooling can increase static stability, and strengthen or initiate CAD. The sheltering effect of clouds can also maintain surface-based stability. Therefore, the ability of numerical forecast models to accurately predict CAD requires adequate representation of cloud and precipitation processes.

The climatology reveals cold-air damming is a year-round phenomenon in the southern Appalachians with the most frequent, prolonged and intense events occurring in winter (particularly December and March) when three-five events per month can be expected. Cold-air damming is least frequent and intense in July. The synoptic case study reveals that cold-air damming is critically dependent upon the configuration of the synoptic-scale flow. The cold dome can be identified by a “U” shaped ridge (trough) in the sea level isobar (thermal) patterns and the 930-mb height (temperature) fields representative of conditions at the base of the inversion overlying the cold dome. Differential horizontal and vertical thermal advection, as well as adiabatic and evaporative cooling, are r...},

Though surface temperatures were initially below freezing in most of this region, objective guidance indicated that large-scale warm would render the atmosphere conducive to rain. Warm advection did occur above about 900 mb, but below this level warm advection was prevented by a cold ~ shaped ridge of high pressure which became entrenched along the east slopes. Temperature in the lowest 0.5–1 km remained below freezing and an ice storm resulted. This case study documents the evolution of the wedge ridge and the temperature and wind fields associated with it. Comparisons are made between the evolution of these fields within the quasi-stationary wedge ridge (a weather regime known as cold-air damming and their evolution during the preceding period, when the pressure ridge was progressing eastward across the Midwest The processes controlling the charges of temperature in these regi...},

However, through hypothesis testing, it was found that some interregional variability exists in the magnitude of various sounding parameters that the authors felt characterized the important aspects of the thermodynamic profile of freezing-rain environments. This variability seems to be related not only to local effects resulting from terrain variations and nearby water sources, but also from regional differences in synoptic-scale atmospheric environments favorable for freezing rain.

Cold air damming did not occur and the purpose of the case study is to diagnose a nonevent so that processes associated with cold air damming can be better isolated. An important finding is that the configuration of the antecedent synoptic-scale flow is crucial in determining whether cold air damming will evolve and be sustained. In the 7–9 March 1986 case a surface anticyclone moved steadily southeastward from west of the Great Lakes to the Middle Atlantic coast and offshore as part of a progressive westerly flow regime aloft.

A widespread arctic air outbreak followed in early April, resulting in extensive agricultural losses over much of the south-central and southeastern US. This 'false spring' event also resulted in widespread damage to newly grown tissues of native deciduous forest species, shown by previous researchers to have had measurable effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. The current study reconstructed the historical occurrence of false springs over most of the southeastern quarter of the conterminous US (32–39°N; 75–98°W) from 1901 to 2007 using daily maximum and minimum temperature records from 176 stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network database, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations. A false spring index was derived that examined the timing of the start of the growing season (SGS), or leaf emergence, relative to the timing of a potentially damaging last hard freeze (minimum temperature ≤ −  2.2 °C). SGS was modeled for the domain by combining EVI data with ground-based temperature 'degree day' calculations reflecting the rate of springtime warming. No significant area-wide, long-term SGS trend was found; however, over much of a contiguous region stretching from Mississippi eastward to the Carolinas, the timing of the last hard freeze was found to occur significantly later, this change occurring along with increased frequency of false springs. Earlier last hard freeze dates and decreased frequency of false springs were found over much of the northwestern part of the study region, including Arkansas and southern Missouri.},

Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of speciesÆ ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins.

Dozens of studies have shown that flowering times for many spring-flowering plants have become earlier as a result of recent climate change, but it is uncertain if flowering times will continue to advance as temperatures rise. Here, we used long-term flowering records initiated by Henry David Thoreau in 1852 and Aldo Leopold in 1935 to investigate this question. Our analyses demonstrate that record-breaking spring temperatures in 2010 and 2012 in Massachusetts, USA, and 2012 in Wisconsin, USA, resulted in the earliest flowering times in recorded history for dozens of spring-flowering plants of the eastern United States. These dramatic advances in spring flowering were successfully predicted by historical relationships between flowering and spring temperature spanning up to 161 years of ecological change. These results demonstrate that numerous temperate plant species have yet to show obvious signs of physiological constraints on phenological advancement in the face of climate change.},

Specifically, the use of vegetation index time series has pushed forward the monitoring of large-scale vegetation phenology. Most of these studies derive key phenological metrics from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series on a per-pixel basis. This paper demonstrates an approach to analyze synoptic spatiotemporal phenological patterns over large areas, rather than per pixel. The selected approach involves data mining using a self-organizing map (SOM) and Sammon's projection. To illustrate our approach, we trained a SOM using 13 years of ten-day NDVI composites from the Système Pour l'Observation de la Terre-VEGETATION over the Kruger National Park, South Africa. This resulted in a topologically ordered set of phenological synoptic states. The Sammon's projection was then used to create a simplified representation of the trained SOM that reflects the similarities among the synoptic states. Subsequently, we depicted phenological trajectories for each vegetation season to show how phenological development changes between years. This time series data mining approach provides a holistic characterization of the main regional phenological dynamics and effectively summarizes the information present in the time series, thus facilitating further interpretation.},

Laboratory biomass combustion experiments showed that methyl bromide was emitted in the smoke from various fuels tested. Methyl bromide was also found in smoke plumes from wildfires in savannas, chaparral, and boreal forest. Global emissions of methyl bromide from biomass burning are estimated to be in the range of 10 to 50 gigagrams per year, which is comparable to the amount produced by ocean emission and pesticide use and represents a major contribution ( approximately 30 percent) to the stratospheric bromine budget.},

These coloured CH3Br tracers\nare then combined in various ways to create one base-line emission\nscenario and five further plausible scenarios. The additional emission\nscenarios are specifically designed to test whether the geographical\ndistribution and seasonal cycles of additional vegetation and/or\nincreased biomass burning emissions are consistent with atmospheric\nobservations of methyl bromide mixing ratios. Due to an imbalance in our\ncurrent understanding of the methyl bromide budget, simulated CH3Br\nmixing ratios from the base-line emission scenario are significantly\nlower than atmospheric measurements. Both the inclusion of a vegetation\nsource in the tropics and a double strength biomass burning source\nsubstantially improve the agreement between model simulations and\natmospheric measurements compared with the base-line emission scenario.\nWhile measurement data provides useful information on global fluxes and\nregional CH3Br seasonal cycles, small differences between the simulated\nseasonal cycles of different emission scenarios makes it difficult to\ndistinguish between the relative likelihoods of model scenarios\ncontaining a tropical vegetation source or an increased biomass burning\nsource. Further measurements performed in continental mid-to-high\nnorthern latitudes, central-southern Africa and South America would be\nof particular benefit in future attempts to constrain the location and\nmagnitude of the natural terrestrial sources of methyl bromide.},

   abstract = {Over the past 30 years, methyl bromide (MBr), a broad spectrum fumigant, has been used extensively for soilborne disease and pest control in the production of many fruit, vegetable, turf, and nursery crops. Recently, agricultural emissions of MBr were implicated as a potentially significant contributor to stratospheric ozone depletion. As a precautionary measure for global ozone protection, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has enforced federal legislation which mandates a complete phase-out of MBr use within the United States by 1 January 2001. Thus, new cost effective, environmentally compatible strategies for control of nematodes and other soilborne pests and pathogens must be developed and tested in a relatively short time to avoid significant losses in crop productivity. The extent to which certain agricultural industries that are now heavily reliant on MBr are affected will depend on the development of sustainable, integrated tactics to pest control, such as combinations of cultural, chemical, and biological tactics. New muhidisciplinary research and extension programs must be developed to address and overcome major constraints and incompatibilities that have prevented such tactics from being widely adopted.},

Results are compared to the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40). Three aspects have been considered: the influence of the interannual SST variations on the climatological mean state, the response to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and the influence on systematic temperature changes. The strongest influence of SST variations has been found for the warm ENSO events considered. Namely, it has been found that the large-scale pattern associated with the extratropical tropospheric response to the ENSO phenomenon during northern winter enhances the forcing and the vertical propagation into the stratosphere of the quasi-stationary planetary waves emerging from the trop...},

Two 160-yr simulations are conducted: one with surface boundary conditions fixed at late twentieth-century values and the other with identical conditions except for Arctic sea ice, which is prescribed at late twenty-first-century values. Their difference isolates the impact of future Arctic sea ice loss upon the atmosphere. The tropospheric circulation response to the imposed ice loss resembles the negative phase of the northern annular mode, with the largest amplitude in winter, while the less well-known stratospheric response transitions from a slight weakening of the polar vortex in winter to a strengthening of the vortex in spring. The lack of a significant winter stratospheric circulation response is shown to be a consequence of largely cancelling effects from sea ice loss in the Atlantic and Pacific s...},

The numerical experiments suggest that the current sea ice conditions force a remote atmospheric response in late winter that favors cold land surface temperatures over midlatitudes, as has been observed in recent years. Anomalous Rossby waves forced by the sea ice anomalies penetrate into the stratosphere in February and weaken the stratospheric polar vortex, resulting in negative anomalies of the northern annular mode (NAM) that propagate downward during the following weeks, especially over the North Pacific. The seasonality of the response is attributed to timing of the phasing between the forced and climatological waves.

Through model experimentation, the first step in this chain is examined by quantifying contributions of various physical factors to October–December (OND) mean Arctic tropospheric warming since 1979. The results indicate that the main factors responsible for Arctic tropospheric warming are recent decadal fluctuations and long-term changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), both located outside the Arctic.

   abstract = {The Arctic region has warmed more than twice as fast as the global average [mdash] a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. The rapid Arctic warming has contributed to dramatic melting of Arctic sea ice and spring snow cover, at a pace greater than that simulated by climate models. These profound changes to the Arctic system have coincided with a period of ostensibly more frequent extreme weather events across the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, including severe winters. The possibility of a link between Arctic change and mid-latitude weather has spurred research activities that reveal three potential dynamical pathways linking Arctic amplification to mid-latitude weather: changes in storm tracks, the jet stream, and planetary waves and their associated energy propagation. Through changes in these key atmospheric features, it is possible, in principle, for sea ice and snow cover to jointly influence mid-latitude weather. However, because of incomplete knowledge of how high-latitude climate change influences these phenomena, combined with sparse and short data records, and imperfect models, large uncertainties regarding the magnitude of such an influence remain. We conclude that improved process understanding, sustained and additional Arctic observations, and better coordinated modelling studies will be needed to advance our understanding of the influences on mid-latitude weather and extreme events.},

Experiments were carried out using the NCAR atmospheric general circulation model with specified sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice anomalies confined to the North Atlantic sector. The spatial pattern of the anomalous forcing was chosen to be realistic in that it corresponds to the recent 40-yr trend in SST and sea ice, but the anomaly amplitude was exaggerated in order to make the response statistically more robust. The wintertime response to both types of forcing resembles the NAO to first order. Even for an exaggerated amplitude, the atmospheric response to the SST anomaly is quite weak compared to the observed positive trend in the NAO, but has the same sign, indicative of a weak ...},

   abstract = {The rise in Arctic near-surface air temperatures has been almost twice as large as the global average in recent decades-a feature known as 'Arctic amplification'. Increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases have driven Arctic and global average warming; however, the underlying causes of Arctic amplification remain uncertain. The roles of reductions in snow and sea ice cover and changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation, cloud cover and water vapour are still matters of debate. A better understanding of the processes responsible for the recent amplified warming is essential for assessing the likelihood, and impacts, of future rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss. Here we show that the Arctic warming is strongest at the surface during most of the year and is primarily consistent with reductions in sea ice cover. Changes in cloud cover, in contrast, have not contributed strongly to recent warming. Increases in atmospheric water vapour content, partly in response to reduced sea ice cover, may have enhanced warming in the lower part of the atmosphere during summer and early autumn. We conclude that diminishing sea ice has had a leading role in recent Arctic temperature amplification. The findings reinforce suggestions that strong positive ice-temperature feedbacks have emerged in the Arctic, increasing the chances of further rapid warming and sea ice loss, and will probably affect polar ecosystems, ice-sheet mass balance and human activities in the Arctic.},

   abstract = {Over the past half century, the Arctic has warmed at about twice the global rate. The reduction of sea ice and snow cover has contributed to the high-latitude warming, as the maximum of the amplification during autumn is a fingerprint of the ice-albedo feedback. There is evidence that atmospheric water vapor, a greenhouse gas, has increased in the Arctic over the past several decades. Ocean heat fluxes into the Arctic from the North Atlantic and North Pacific have also contributed to the Arctic warming through a reduction of sea ice. Observational and modeling studies suggest that reduced sea ice cover and a warmer Arctic in autumn may affect the middle latitudes by weakening the west-to-east wind speeds in the upper atmosphere, by increasing the frequency of wintertime blocking events that in turn lead to persistence or slower propagation of anomalous temperatures in middle latitudes, and by increasing continental snow cover that can in turn influence the atmospheric circulation. While these effects on middle latitudes have been suggested by some analyses, natural variability has thus far precluded a conclusive demonstration of an impact of the Arctic on mid-latitude weather and climate.},

Tracking seasonal transitions in a consistent manner across space and through time requires indices that can be used for monitoring and managing biophysical and ecological systems during the coming decades. Here a new gridded dataset of spring indices is described and used to understand interannual, decadal, and secular trends across the coterminous US. This dataset is derived from daily interpolated meteorological data, and results are compared with historical station data to ensure the trends and variations are robust. Regional trends in the first leaf index range from –0.8 to –1.6 days per decade, while first bloom index trends are between –0.4 and –1.2 for most regions. However, these trends are modulated by interannual to multidecadal variations, which are substantial throughout the regions considered here. These findings emphasize...},

   abstract = {AbstractSpatial and temporal patterns of variability in spring onset are identified across western North America using a spring index (SI) model based on weather station minimum and maximum temperatures (Tmin and Tmax, respectively). Principal component analysis shows that two significant and independent patterns explain roughly half of the total variance in the timing of spring onset from 1920 to 2005. However, these patterns of spring onset do not appear to be linear responses to the primary modes of variability in the Northern Hemisphere: the Pacific–North American pattern (PNA) and the northern annular mode (NAM). Instead, over the period when reanalysis data and the spring index model overlap (1950–2005), the patterns of spring onset are local responses to the state of both the PNA and NAM, which together modulate the onset date of spring by 10–20 days on interannual time scales. They do so by controlling the number and intensity of warm days. There is also a regionwide trend in spring advancement of...},

@book{Jacob1999,
   abstract = {Atmospheric chemistry is one of the fastest growing fields in the earth sciences. Until now, however, there has been no book designed to help students capture the essence of the subject in a brief course of study. Daniel Jacob, a leading researcher and teacher in the field, addresses that problem by presenting the first textbook on atmospheric chemistry for a one-semester course. Based on the approach he developed in his class at Harvard, Jacob introduces students in clear and concise chapters to the fundamentals as well as the latest ideas and findings in the field. Jacob's aim is to show students how to use basic principles of physics and chemistry to describe a complex system such as the atmosphere. He also seeks to give students an overview of the current state of research and the work that led to this point. Jacob begins with atmospheric structure, design of simple models, atmospheric transport, and the continuity equation, and continues with geochemical cycles, the greenhouse effect, aerosols, stratospheric ozone, the oxidizing power of the atmosphere, smog, and acid rain. Each chapter concludes with a problem set based on recent scientific literature. This is a novel approach to problem-set writing, and one that successfully introduces students to the prevailing issues. This is a major contribution to a growing area of study and will be welcomed enthusiastically by students and teachers alike.},

   abstract = {Atmospheric methyl bromide (CH3Br) and methyl chloride (CH3Cl), compounds that are involved in stratospheric ozone depletion, originate from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Current estimates of CH3Br and CH3Cl emissions from oceanic sources, terrestrial plants and fungi, biomass burning and anthropogenic inputs do not balance their losses owing to oxidation by hydroxyl radicals, oceanic degradation, and consumption in soils, suggesting that additional natural terrestrial sources may be important. Here we show that CH3Br and CH3Cl are released to the atmosphere from all vegetation zones of two coastal salt marshes. We see very large fluxes of CH3Br and CH3Cl per unit area: up to 42 and 570 micromol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The fluxes show large diurnal, seasonal and spatial variabilities, but there is a strong correlation between the fluxes of CH3Br and those of CH3Cl, with an average molar flux ratio of roughly 1:20. If our measurements are typical of salt marshes globally, they suggest that such ecosystems, even though they constitute less than 0.1% of the global surface area, may produce roughly 10% of the total fluxes of atmospheric CH3Br and CH3Cl.},

Observations by Lazrus et. al.

The authors' systems theory approach looks holistically at all that happens on Earth and the interactions of all that is here—such as the effect of weather on land, the effect of erosion on the ocean, the chemical changes that occur—and emphasizes that these processes do not happen in a vacuum. An emphasis on global change addresses such modern issues as global warming, ozone depletion, and biodiversity loss.A variety of boxed inserts address topical issues related to the material presented, giving readers appealing visual and highlighted aids.

   abstract = {The Earth's climate is changing rapidly as a result of anthropogenic carbon emissions, and damaging impacts are expected to increase with warming. To prevent these and limit long-term global surface warming to, for example, 2 °C, a level of stabilization or of peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations needs to be set. Climate sensitivity, the global equilibrium surface warming after a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration, can help with the translation of atmospheric CO2 levels to warming. Various observations favour a climate sensitivity value of about 3 °C, with a likely range of about 2–4.5 °C. However, the physics of the response and uncertainties in forcing lead to fundamental difficulties in ruling out higher values. The quest to determine climate sensitivity has now been going on for decades, with disturbingly little progress in narrowing the large uncertainty range. However, in the process, fascinating new insights into the climate system and into policy aspects regarding mitigation have been gained. The well-constrained lower limit of climate sensitivity and the transient rate of warming already provide useful information for policy makers. But the upper limit of climate sensitivity will be more difficult to quantify.},

But it remains difficult to assess the likelihood of future changes in the thermohaline circulation, mainly owing to poorly constrained model parameterizations and uncertainties in the response of the climate system to greenhouse warming. Analyses of past abrupt climate changes help to solve these problems. Data and models both suggest that abrupt climate change during the last glaciation originated through changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation in response to small changes in the hydrological cycle. Atmospheric and oceanic responses to these changes were then transmitted globally through a number of feedbacks. The palaeoclimate data and the model results also indicate that the stability of the thermohaline circulation depends on the mean climate state.},

   abstract = {Present estimates of the future oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 and calculations of CO2-emission scenarios1 are based on the assumption that the natural carbon cycle is in steady state. But it iswell known from palaeoclimate records2, 3, 4, 5 and modelling studies6, 7, 8, 9 that the climate system has more than one equilibrium state, and that perturbations can trigger transitions between them. Anticipated future changes in today's climate system due to human activities have the potential to weaken the thermohaline circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean10, 11, 12, which would greatly modify estimates of future oceanic CO2 uptake13. Here we use a simple coupled atmosphere–ocean climate model to show that the Atlantic thermohaline circulation is not only sensitive to the final atmospheric CO2 concentration attained, but also depends on the rate of change of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. A modelled increase to 750 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.) CO2 within 100 years (corresponding approximately to a continuation of today's growth rate) leads to a permanent shut-down of the thermohaline circulation. If the final atmospheric concentration of 750 p.p.m.v. CO2 is attained more slowly, the thermohaline circulation simply slows down. The reason for this rate-sensitive response of the climate system lies with the transfer of buoyancy in the form of heat and fresh water from the uppermost layers of the ocean into the deep waters below. This sensitivity of the simulated thermohaline circulation to the rate ofchange of atmospheric CO2 concentration has potentially important implications for the choice of future CO2-emission scenarios1.},

Ocean carbon-cycle models used in calculating these scenarios assume that oceanic circulation and biology remain unchanged through time. Here we examine the importance of this assumption by using a coupled atmosphere–ocean model of global warming5 for the period 1765 to 2065. We find a large potential modification to the ocean carbon sink in a vast region of the Southern Ocean where increased rainfall leads to surface freshening and increased stratification6. The increased stratification reduces the downward flux of carbon and the loss of heat to the atmosphere, both of which decrease the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 relative to a constant-climate control scenario. Changes in the formation, transport and cycling of biological material may counteract the reduced uptake, but the response of the biological community to the climate change is difficult to predict on present understanding. Our simulation suggests that such physical and biological changes might already be occurring, and that they could substantially affect the ocean carbon sink over the next few decades.},

The latter coefficient, which is of the order of 70 ly day−1 (°C)−1, varies with latitude by as much as 20%. It is suggested that the use of the above relation as a flux-type thermal boundary condition would allow for large-scale thermal coupling of ocean and atmosphere.

The estimated increase of observed global ocean heat content (over the depth range from 0 to 3000 meters) between the 1950s and 1990s is at least one order of magnitude larger than the increase in heat content of any other component. Simulation results using an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model that includes estimates of the radiative effects of observed temporal variations in greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols, solar irradiance, and volcanic aerosols over the past century agree with our observation-based estimate of the increase in ocean heat content.

In addition to the direct effects on climate--for example, on the frequency of heatwaves--this increase in surface temperatures has important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability--predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions--are likely to be severe.},

   abstract = {The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a naturally occurring fluctuation that originates in the tropical Pacific region and affects ecosystems, agriculture, freshwater supplies, hurricanes and other severe weather events worldwide. Under the influence of global warming, the mean climate of the Pacific region will probably undergo significant changes. The tropical easterly trade winds are expected to weaken; surface ocean temperatures are expected to warm fastest near the equator and more slowly farther away; the equatorial thermocline that marks the transition between the wind-mixed upper ocean and deeper layers is expected to shoal; and the temperature gradients across the thermocline are expected to become steeper. Year-to-year ENSO variability is controlled by a delicate balance of amplifying and damping feedbacks, and one or more of the physical processes that are responsible for determining the characteristics of ENSO will probably be modified by climate change. Therefore, despite considerable progress in our understanding of the impact of climate change on many of the processes that contribute to El Niño variability, it is not yet possible to say whether ENSO activity will be enhanced or damped, or if the frequency of events will change.},

   abstract = {Some of the most species-rich plant communities occur on ancient, strongly weathered soils, whereas those on recently developed soils tend to be less diverse. Mechanisms underlying this well-known pattern, however, remain unresolved. Here, we present a conceptual model describing alternative mechanisms by which pedogenesis (the process of soil formation) might drive plant diversity. We suggest that long-term soil chronosequences offer great, yet largely untapped, potential as 'natural experiments' to determine edaphic controls over plant diversity. Finally, we discuss how our conceptual model can be evaluated quantitatively using structural equation modeling to advance multivariate theories about the determinants of local plant diversity. This should help us to understand broader-scale diversity patterns, such as the latitudinal gradient of plant diversity.},

   abstract = {Possible future changes in Arctic sea ice cover and thickness, and consequent changes in the ice-albedo feedback, represent one of the largest uncertainties in the prediction of future temperature rise. Knowledge of the natural variability of sea ice thickness is therefore critical for its representation in global climate models. Numerical simulations suggest that Arctic ice thickness varies primarily on decadal timescales owing to changes in wind and ocean stresses on the ice, but observations have been unable to provide a synoptic view of sea ice thickness, which is required to validate the model results. Here we use an eight-year time-series of Arctic ice thickness, derived from satellite altimeter measurements of ice freeboard, to determine the mean thickness field and its variability from 65 degrees N to 81.5 degrees N. Our data reveal a high-frequency interannual variability in mean Arctic ice thickness that is dominated by changes in the amount of summer melt, rather than by changes in circulation. Our results suggest that a continued increase in melt season length would lead to further thinning of Arctic sea ice.},

Sea ice variability is quantified based on the leading empirical orthogonal function of sea ice concentration over the North Atlantic [the Greenland Sea ice dipole (GSD)], which, in its positive polarity, has anomalously high sea ice concentrations in the Labrador Sea region to the southwest of Greenland and low sea ice concentrations in the Barents Sea region to the northeast of Greenland. In weekly data for December through April, the VAR indicates that NAO index (N) anomalies cause like-signed anomalies of the standardized GSD index (G), and that G anomalies in turn cause oppositely signed anomalies of N. This negative feedback process operates explicitly on lags of up to four weeks in the VAR but can generate more persistent effects because o...},

   abstract = {Satellite and aircraft observations have revealed that remarkable changes in the Earth's polar ice cover have occurred in the last decade. The impacts of these changes, which include dramatic ice loss from ice sheets and rapid declines in Arctic sea ice, could be quite large in terms of sea level rise and global climate. NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), currently planned for launch in 2015, is specifically intended to quantify the amount of change in ice sheets and sea ice and provide key insights into their behavior. It will achieve these objectives through the use of precise laser measurements of surface elevation, building on the groundbreaking capabilities of its predecessor, the Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). In particular, ICESat-2 will measure the temporal and spatial character of ice sheet elevation change to enable assessment of ice sheet mass balance and examination of the underlying mechanisms that control it. The precision of ICESat-2's elevation measurement will also allow for accurate measurements of sea ice freeboard height, from which sea ice thickness and its temporal changes can be estimated. ICESat-2 will provide important information on other components of the Earth System as well, most notably large-scale vegetation biomass estimates through the measurement of vegetation canopy height. When combined with the original ICESat observations, ICESat-2 will provide ice change measurements across more than a 15-year time span. Its significantly improved laser system will also provide observations with much greater spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and accuracy than has ever been possible before.},

   abstract = {The decline of Arctic sea ice has been documented in over 30 y of satellite passive microwave observations. The resulting darkening of the Arctic and its amplification of global warming was hypothesized almost 50 y ago but has yet to be verified with direct observations. This study uses satellite radiation budget measurements along with satellite microwave sea ice data to document the Arctic-wide decrease in planetary albedo and its amplifying effect on the warming. The analysis reveals a striking relationship between planetary albedo and sea ice cover, quantities inferred from two independent satellite instruments. We find that the Arctic planetary albedo has decreased from 0.52 to 0.48 between 1979 and 2011, corresponding to an additional 6.4 ± 0.9 W/m(2) of solar energy input into the Arctic Ocean region since 1979. Averaged over the globe, this albedo decrease corresponds to a forcing that is 25% as large as that due to the change in CO2 during this period, considerably larger than expectations from models and other less direct recent estimates. Changes in cloudiness appear to play a negligible role in observed Arctic darkening, thus reducing the possibility of Arctic cloud albedo feedbacks mitigating future Arctic warming.},

We provide a synthesis of research on Arctic amplification, starting with a historical context and then addressing recent insights into processes and key impacts, based on analysis of the instrumental record, modeling studies, and paleoclimate reconstructions. Arctic amplification is now recognized as an inherent characteristic of the global climate system, with multiple intertwined causes operating on a spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. These include, but are not limited to, changes in sea ice extent that impact heat fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere, atmospheric and oceanic heat transports, cloud cover and water vapor that alter the longwave radiation flux to the surface, soot on snow and heightened black carbon aerosol concentrations. Strong warming over the Arctic Ocean during the past decade in autumn and winter, clearly associated with reduced sea ice extent, is but the most recent manifestation of the phenomenon. Indeed, periods of Arctic amplification are evident from analysis of both warm and cool periods over at least the past three million years. Arctic amplification being observed today is expected to become stronger in coming decades, invoking changes in atmospheric circulation, vegetation and the carbon cycle, with impacts both within and beyond the Arctic.},

   abstract = {This paper describes the CryoSat satellite mission, due for launch in 2005, whose aim is to accurately determine the trends in Earth’s continental and marine ice fields. The paper’s purpose is to provide scientific users of the CryoSat data with a description of the design and operation of the SIRAL radar and the CryoSat platform, the data products, and the expected error budget. The ‘low-resolution mode’ (LRM), ‘synthetic aperture mode’ (SARM) and “synthetic aperture interferometric mode’ (SARInM) of the SIRAL radar are described, together with its system parameters, its antenna gain pattern and interferometer phase difference pattern, and its calibration modes. The orbit is described, together with the platform attitude and altitude control law and control systems, and the expected pointing and altitude knowledge. The geographical masks that are used to determine acquisitions in the three SIRAL modes are described. The SIRAL data products, and the processing applied to produce them, are described. Level 1b, level 2 and higher-level products are described in turn, with a particular emphasis on the new procedures applied to the SARInM and SARM processing over ice surfaces. The beam forming and multi-looking is summarised, and a description is given of the behaviour of the SARM and SARInM echoes over idealised surfaces. These inform descriptions of the elevation retrievals of the level 2 processing, including the SARInM retrieval of interferometric phase. The combination of these data, through cross-over analysis over continental ice sheets, and through averaging over sea-ice, to determine areal averages of ice sheet elevation change or sea-ice thickness, is described. The error budget in these higher-level products is described, together with its breakdown into errors arising from the instrument and errors arising from the retrievals. The importance of the co-variance of these errors in determining the final error is stressed. The description of the errors also includes a summary of the experiments required following the launch to validate the CryoSat mission data. An estimate of the mission performance over ice surfaces is made at various spatial scales, and it is concluded that even the relatively short, three-year duration of the CryoSat mission will allow it to make an important scientific contribution, particularly when combined with results from earlier satellite missions.},

   abstract = {We present our estimates of the thickness and volume of the Arctic Ocean ice cover from CryoSat-2 data acquired between October 2010 and May 2014. Average ice thickness and draft differences are within 0.16 m of measurements from other sources (moorings, submarine, electromagnetic sensors, IceBridge). The choice of parameters that affect the conversion of ice freeboard to thickness is discussed. Estimates between 2011 and 2013 suggest moderate decreases in volume followed by a notable increase of more than 2500 km(3) (or 0.34 m of thickness over the basin) in 2014, which could be attributed to not only a cooler summer in 2013 but also to large-scale ice convergence just west of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago due to wind-driven onshore drift. Variability of volume and thickness in the multiyear ice zone underscores the importance of dynamics in maintaining the thickness of the Arctic ice cover. Volume estimates are compared with those from ICESat as well as the trends in ice thickness derived from submarine ice draft between 1980 and 2004. The combined ICESat and CryoSat-2 record yields reduced trends in volume loss compared with the 5 year ICESat record, which was weighted by the record-setting ice extent after the summer of 2007.},

   abstract = {Soils are subject to varying degrees of direct or indirect human disturbance, constituting a major global change driver. Factoring out natural from direct and indirect human influence is not always straightforward, but some human activities have clear impacts. These include land use change, land management, and land degradation (erosion, compaction, sealing and salinization). The intensity of land use also exerts a great impact on soils, and soils are also subject to indirect impacts arising from human activity, such as acid deposition (sulphur and nitrogen) and heavy metal pollution. In this critical review, we report the state-of-the-art understanding of these global change pressures on soils, identify knowledge gaps and research challenges, and highlight actions and policies to minimise adverse environmental impacts arising from these global change drivers. Soils are central to considerations of what constitutes sustainable intensification. Therefore, ensuring that vulnerable and high environmental value soils are considered when protecting important habitats and ecosystems, will help to reduce the pressure on land from global change drivers. To ensure that soils are protected as part of wider environmental efforts, a global soil resilience programme should be considered, to monitor, recover or sustain soil fertility and function, and to enhance the ecosystem services provided by soils. Soils cannot, and should not, be considered in isolation of the ecosystems that they underpin and vice versa. The role of soils in supporting ecosystems and natural capital needs greater recognition. The lasting legacy of the International Year of Soils in 2015 should be to put soils at the centre of policy supporting environmental protection and sustainable development.

Parallel experiments with different ocean model configurations (full-depth, slab, and no interactive ocean) allow the roles of dynamical and thermodynamic ocean feedbacks to be isolated. In the absence of ocean coupling, the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss is confined to north of 30°N, consisting of a weakening and equatorward shift of the westerlies accompanied by lower tropospheric warming and enhanced precipitation at high latitudes. With ocean feedbacks, the response expands to cover the whole globe and exhibits a high degree of equatorial symmetry: the entire troposphere warms, the global hydrological cycle strengthens, and the intertropical convergence zones shift equatorward. Ocean dynamics are fundamental to producing this equatorially symmetric pattern...},

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

Interglacial times with SSTs equal to or exceeding that of the Holocene contain peak abundances in the pollen of redwood, the distinctive component of the temperate rainforest of the northwest coast of California. In the region now dominated by the California Current, SSTs warmed 10,000 to 15,000 years in advance of deglaciation at each of the past five glacial maxima. SSTs did not rise in advance of deglaciation south of the modern California Current front. Glacial warming along the California margin therefore is a regional signal of the weakening of the California Current during times when large ice sheets reorganized wind systems over the North Pacific. Both the timing and magnitude of the SST estimates suggest that the Devils Hole (Nevada) calcite record represents regional but not global paleotemperatures, and hence does not pose a fundamental challenge to the orbital ("Milankovitch") theory of the Ice Ages.},

   abstract = {Among the least understood interactions between physics and biology in the oceans are those that take place on the decadal scale. But this temporal scale is important because some of the greatest ecological events take place on this time scale. More than 50 years of measurement in the California Current System have revealed significant ecosystem changes, including a large, decadal decline in zooplankton biomass, along with a rise in upper-ocean temperature. The temperature change was a relatively abrupt shift around 1976-77, concurrent with other basin-wide changes associated with an intensification of the Aleutian Low-pressure system. This intensification generates temperature anomalies in the ocean by altering the patterns of net surface-heat fluxes, turbulent mixing, and horizontal transport. Changes in the mean abundance of zooplankton in the southern California Current have been attributed to variations in the strength of coastal upwelling, variations in the horizontal transport of nutrient-rich water from the north, or increased stratification due to warming, all of which could be affected by fluctuations in the Aleutian Low. Here we show that a deepening of the thermocline accompanied the warming and increased the stratification of the water column, leading to a decrease in the supply of plant nutrients to the upper layers. This is the most likely mechanism for the observed plankton decline, and subsequent ecosystem changes. A global change in upper-ocean heat content, accompanied by an increase in stratification and mixed-layer deepening relative to the critical depth for net production, could lead to a widespread decline in plankton abundance.},

An overall warming trend of 1.3°C in the ocean surface, a deepening in the depth of the mean thermocline (18 m), and increased stratification between 1950 and 1999 are found to be primarily forced by large-scale decadal fluctuations in surface heat fluxes combined with horizontal advection by the mean currents. After 1998 the surface heat fluxes suggest the beginning of a period of cooling, consistent with colder observed ocean temperatures.

   abstract = {The response of marine and terrestrial environments to global changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentrations will likely be governed by both responses to direct environmental forcing and responses to Earth-system feedbacks induced by that forcing. It has been proposed that anthropogenic greenhouse forcing will intensify coastal upwelling in eastern boundary current regions [Bakun, A. (1990) Science 247, 198-201]. Focusing on the California Current, we show that biophysical land-cover-atmosphere feedbacks induced by CO(2) radiative forcing enhance the radiative effects of CO(2) on land-sea thermal contrast, resulting in changes in eastern boundary current total seasonal upwelling and upwelling seasonality. Specifically, relative to CO(2) radiative forcing, land-cover-atmosphere feedbacks lead to a stronger increase in peak- and late-season near-shore upwelling in the northern limb of the California Current and a stronger decrease in peak- and late-season near-shore upwelling in the southern limb. Such changes will impact both marine and terrestrial communities [Bakun, A. (1990) Science 247, 198-201; Soto, C. G. (2001) Rev. Fish Biol. Fish. 11, 181-195; and Agostini, V. N. & Bakun, A. (2002) Fish. Oceanogr. 11, 129-142], and these and other Earth-system feedbacks should be expected to play a substantial role in shaping the response of eastern boundary current regions to CO(2) radiative forcing.},

   abstract = {In 1990, Andrew Bakun proposed that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations would force intensification of upwelling-favorable winds in eastern boundary current systems that contribute substantial services to society. Because there is considerable disagreement about whether contemporary wind trends support Bakun's hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature on upwelling-favorable wind intensification. The preponderance of published analyses suggests that winds have intensified in the California, Benguela, and Humboldt upwelling systems and weakened in the Iberian system over time scales ranging up to 60 years; wind change is equivocal in the Canary system. Stronger intensification signals are observed at higher latitudes, consistent with the warming pattern associated with climate change. Overall, reported changes in coastal winds, although subtle and spatially variable, support Bakun's hypothesis of upwelling intensification in eastern boundary current systems.},

Nutrients fuel the growth of phytoplankton, the base of a very productive coastal marine ecosystem [Pauly D, Christensen V (1995) Nature 374:255-257]. Because nutrient supply and phytoplankton biomass in shelf waters are highly sensitive to variation in upwelling-driven circulation, shifts in the timing and strength of upwelling may alter basic nutrient and carbon fluxes through marine food webs. We show how a 1-month delay in the 2005 spring transition to upwelling-favorable wind stress in the northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem resulted in numerous anomalies: warm water, low nutrient levels, low primary productivity, and an unprecedented low recruitment of rocky intertidal organisms. The delay was associated with 20- to 40-day wind oscillations accompanying a southward shift of the jet stream. Early in the upwelling season (May-July) off Oregon, the cumulative upwelling-favorable wind stress was the lowest in 20 years, nearshore surface waters averaged 2 degrees C warmer than normal, surf-zone chlorophyll-a and nutrients were 50% and 30% less than normal, respectively, and densities of recruits of mussels and barnacles were reduced by 83% and 66%, respectively. Delayed early-season upwelling and stronger late-season upwelling are consistent with predictions of the influence of global warming on coastal upwelling regions.},

   abstract = {We summarize 50 years of physical oceanographic data in the southern portion of the California Current System (CCS) based on the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) hydrographic record, 1950–1999. The long-term mean water property and circulation patterns are described, and the local signature of the large-scale 1976–1977 North Pacific climate regime shift is characterized. Changes associated with the climate shift include (1) significant warming in the upper 200–400m of the water column, a decrease in salinity in near-surface coastal waters, and an increase in salinity in subsurface offshore waters; (2) deeper density surfaces and increased stratification throughout the region, particularly within the Southern California Bight; (3) a subtle reorganization of the geostrophic flow structure, including an offshore shift of the California Current and increased nearshore poleward flow; and (4) a cross-shore dichotomy, with the nearshore regime changes occurring primarily during the upwelling season and the offshore variability being of lower frequency than nearer the coast. Changes in the vertical structure of the water column are of particular significance, as they have likely rendered upwelling less biologically effective. This is evident in the temperature and salinity changes, which were greatest (warming and freshening) just above the peak stability changes. There is evidence to suggest that another North Pacific-wide regime shift occurred following the 1997–1998 El Niño event, and large ecosystem changes are anticipated. The CalCOFI record is ideally suited for revealing the mechanisms of interdecadal physical–biological interactions in the coastal ocean.},

The weekly product has been available since 1993 and is widely used for weather and climate monitoring and forecasting. Errors in the satellite bias correction and the sea ice to SST conversion algorithm are discussed, and then an improved version of the OI analysis is developed. The changes result in a modest reduction in the satellite bias that leaves small global residual biases of roughly −0.03°C. The major improvement in the analysis occurs at high latitudes due to the new sea ice algorithm where local differences between the old and new analysis can exceed 1°C. Comparisons with other SST products are needed to determine the consistency of the OI. These comparisons show that the differences among products occur on large time- and space scales wit...},

We describe a new technique designed to process radar echograms from the University of Kansas snow radar to estimate snow depth. We combine IceBridge laser altimetry with radar-derived snow depths to determine sea ice thickness. Results are validated through comparison with direct measurements of snow and ice thickness collected in situ at the Danish GreenArc 2009 sea ice camp located on fast ice north of Greenland. The IceBridge instrument suite provides accurate measurements of snow and ice thickness, particularly over level ice. Mean IceBridge snow and ice thickness agree with in situ measurements to within ~ 0.01 and ~ 0.05 m, respectively, while modal snow and ice thickness estimates agree to within 0.02 and 0.10 m, respectively. IceBridge snow depths were correlated with in situ measurements (R = 0.7, for an averaging length of 55 m). The uncertainty associated with the derived IceBridge sea ice thickness estimates is 0.40 m. The results demonstrate the retrieval of both first-year and multiyear ice thickness from IceBridge data. The airborne data were however compromised in heavily ridged ice where snow depth, and hence ice thickness, could not be measured. Techniques developed as part of this study will be used for routine processing of IceBridge retrievals over Arctic sea ice. The limitations of the GreenArc study are discussed, and recommendations for future validation of airborne measurements via field activities are provided.},

However, the underlying cause of this increased surface melting and how it relates to cryospheric changes across the Arctic remain unclear. Here we show that an important contributing factor is the decreasing Arctic sea ice. Reduced summer sea ice favors stronger and more frequent occurrences of blocking-high pressure events over Greenland. Blocking highs enhance the transport of warm, moist air over Greenland, which increases downwelling infrared radiation, contributes to increased extreme heat events, and accounts for the majority of the observed warming trends. These findings are supported by analyses of observations and reanalysis data, as well as by independent atmospheric model simulations using a state-of-the-art atmospheric model that is forced by varying only the sea ice conditions. Reduced sea ice conditions in the model favor more extensive Greenland surface melting. We find that a positive feedback betwe...},

The initial adjustment of the atmospheric circulation is characterized by an out-of-phase relationship between geopotential height anomalies in the lower and upper troposphere localized to the vicinity of the forcing. This initial baroclinic response reaches a maximum amplitude in ∼5–10 days, and persists for 2–3 weeks. Diagnostic results with a linear primitive equation model indicate that this initial response is forced by diabatic heating anomalies in the lower troposphere associated with surface heat flux anomalies generated by the imposed thermal forcing.

   abstract = {The stratospheric response to the observed Arctic sea ice retreat is analysed based on European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) Re-Analysis Interim (ERA-Interim) atmospheric data from 19792012. It is shown that changes in August/September sea ice concentration impact on tropospheric and stratospheric geopotential heights in the following winter. During low ice phases a negative tropospheric Arctic Oscillation pattern is found, which is connected to a weakened stratospheric polar vortex and warmer stratospheric temperatures. Furthermore, the analysis reveals enhanced upward EP fluxes due to planetary waves for low ice conditions. Strong stratospheric anomalies in the Atlantic/European region are associated with a weaker polar vortex. Low ice periods are connected with additional tropospheric wave energy excitation in the Pacific/North America region and influence the stratosphere through three-dimensional planetary wave propagation.

   abstract = {AbstractReduction of the Arctic sea ice cover can affect the atmospheric circulation and thus impact the climate beyond the Arctic. The atmospheric response may, however, vary with the geographical location of sea ice loss. The atmospheric sensitivity to the location of sea ice loss is studied using a general circulation model in a configuration that allows combination of a prescribed sea ice cover and an active mixed layer ocean. This hybrid setup makes it possible to simulate the isolated impact of sea ice loss and provides a more complete response compared to experiments with fixed sea surface temperatures. Three investigated sea ice scenarios with ice loss in different regions all exhibit substantial near-surface warming, which peaks over the area of ice loss. The maximum warming is found during winter, delayed compared to the maximum sea ice reduction. The wintertime response of the midlatitude atmospheric circulation shows a nonuniform sensitivity to the location of sea ice reduction. While all thre...},

In operational forecasts since 1999, snow cover has been used for seven winters, and sea level pressure anomalies for three winters. Presented are skill scores for these seven real-time forecasts and also for 33 winter hindcasts (1972/73–2004/05). The model demonstrates positive skill over much of the eastern United States and northern Eurasia—regions that have eluded skillful predictions among the existing major seasonal forecast centers. Comparison with three leading dynamical forecast systems shows that the statistical model produces superior skill for the same regions. Despite the increasing complexity of the dynamical models, they continue to derive their forecast skill predominantly from tropical atmosphere–ocean coupling, in particul...},

The total response is partioned into a portion that projects onto the leading mode of internal variability (the indirect response) and a portion that is the residual from that projection (the direct response). This empirical decomposition yields physically meaningful patterns whose distinctive horizontal and vertical structures imply different governing mechanisms. The indirect response, which dominates the total geopotential height response, is hemispheric in scale with resemblance to the North Atlantic Oscillation or Northern Hemisphere annular mode, and equivalent barotropic in the vertical from the surface to the tropopaus...},

   abstract = {The most comprehensive large-scale characterization of the global sea ice cover so far has been provided by satellite passive microwave data. Accurate retrieval of ice concentrations from these data is important because of the sensitivity of surface flux (e.g., heat, salt, and water) calculations to small changes in the amount of open water (leads and polynyas) within the polar ice packs. Two algorithms that have been used for deriving ice concentrations from multichannel data are compared. One is the NASA Team algorithm and the other is the Bootstrap algorithm, both of which were developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The two algorithms use different channel combinations, reference brightness temperatures, weather filters, and techniques. Analyses are made to evaluate the sensitivity of algorithm results to variations of emissivity and temperature with space and time. To assess the difference in the performance of the two algorithms, analyses were performed with data from both hemispheres and for all seasons. The results show only small differences in the central Arctic in winter but larger disagreements in the seasonal regions and in summer. In some areas in the Antarctic, the Bootstrap technique shows ice concentrations higher than those of the Team algorithm by as much as 25%; whereas, in other areas, it shows ice concentrations lower by as much as 30%. The differences in the results are caused by temperature effects, emissivity effects, and tie point differences. The Team and the Bootstrap results were compared with available Landsat, advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. AVHRR, Landsat, and SAR data sets all yield higher concentrations than the passive microwave algorithms. Inconsistencies among results suggest the need for further validation studies.},

Daily, monthly and annual Arctic sea-ice concentration, area and extent were calculated by the algorithms using daily microwave brightness temperatures from SMMR, SSM/I, and SSMIS for the period 1979-2012. The differences between the 11 sea-ice concentration estimates-structural uncertainties-were quantified and analyzed spatially and seasonally. The algorithms differ in annual sea-ice area by 0.0-1.3 million km2 and in extent by 0.0-0.6 million km2. Linear trends for 34- and 21-year periods were calculated and compared for sea-ice concentration, area and extent. Low-frequency algorithms obtained annual Arctic sea-ice area decrease of 0.534-0.573 million km2 per decade (0.439-0.491 million km2 per decade for the extent) over the period 1979 to 2012, and a decrease of 0.866-0.975 million km2 per decade (0.767-0.812 million km2 per decade for the extent) for the 1992-2012 period. High-frequency algorithms obtained a decrease of 0.766-0.978 million km2 per decade in the area and 0.758-0.814 million km2 per decade in the extent over the period 1992-2012. Results for all the algorithms have close agreement on the strength of the negative trend in Arctic sea-ice area and extent, but are individually biased from the mean. The algorithms' ensemble mean and standard deviation in sea-ice concentration, describing part of the uncertainty, are presented to provide users with more insight into the uncertainties and potential biases of sea-ice concentration data.},

As determined from an analysis of 17 submarine cruises, the overall mean thickness of Arctic sea ice above 65° N, including both deformed and undeformed ice, is 2.9 m with a standard deviation of 1.8 m. The overall seasonal mean ranges from approximately 2.4 m in spring to 3.3 m in summer. Local mean ice drafts ranged from less than 1 m near the marginal ice zone to greater than 7 m to the north of the Canadian Archipelago. Histograms of sea ice draft reflect a bimodal distribution in winter and spring, an effect of the presence of thin first year ice.

   abstract = {The use of altimeter data in the polar regions has previously been limited by the presence of permanent and seasonal ice cover. Changes in the radar echo shape received by the altimeter over sea ice, as compared with the open ocean, cause problems in the on-board estimates of surface height, making the data unusable. The majority of noise on the signal can be reduced by retracking the full waveform data set (WAP). Careful quality control is applied to ensure that only those return echoes from which accurate height measurements can be obtained are retained. Consideration of possible backscattering mechanisms from ice and water, and comparisons with imagery, suggest that the specular waveforms typically found in altimeter data over sea ice originate from regions of open water or new thin ice exposed within the altimeter footprint. However, diffuse waveforms similar to those found in ice free seas have been observed in areas of consolidated ice, and may be used to measure ice freeboard. Until recently, even retracked heights contained substantial residual errors due to the interaction of the on-board tracking system with the complex return echoes over sea ice. Software simulation of the tracking system has led to the development of new ground processing algorithms, which further reduce the short wavelength (~26 km) noise, from 30-50 cm to around 7 cm. This provides, for the first time in ice covered seas, the capability for accurate mean sea surface generation, measurement of tidal and oceanographic signals and determination of sea ice freeboard. The authors present the results of comparisons of sea surface height variability from ERS-2 radar altimetry in the Arctic with the output from a high resolution Arctic Ocean circulation model},

Time-series of elevation changes will enable determination of the present-day mass balance of the ice sheets, study of associations between observed ice changes and polar climate, and estimation of the present and future contributions of the ice sheets to global sea level rise. Other scientific objectives of ICESat include: global measurements of cloud heights and the vertical structure of clouds and aerosols; precise measurements of land topography and vegetation canopy heights; and measurements of sea ice roughness, sea ice thickness, ocean surface elevations, and surface reflectivity. The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on ICESat has a 1064 nm laser channel for surface altimetry and dense cloud heights and a 532 nm lidar channel for the vertical distribution of clouds and aerosols. The predicted accuracy for the surface-elevation measurements is 15 cm, averaged over 60 m diameter laser footprints spaced at 172 m along-track.

The on-board GPS receiver will enable radial orbit determinations to better than 5 cm, and star-trackers will enable footprints to be located to 6 m horizontally. The spacecraft attitude will be controlled to point the laser beam to within±35 m of reference surface tracks at high latitudes.

Although the POIM aims at modeling the global ocean and sea ice system, the focus of this study is on the presentation, implementation, and evaluation of the TED sea ice model in a generalized coordinate system. The TED sea ice model is a dynamic thermodynamic model that also explicitly simulates sea ice ridging. Using a viscous plastic rheology, the TED model is formulated such that all the metric terms in generalized curvilinear coordinates are retained.

   abstract = {Abstract The theory of sea ice thickness distribution developed by Thorndike et al. has been extended to include sea ice enthalpy distribution. The extended theory conserves both ice mass and thermal energy, in the form of the heat stored in the ice, by jointly solving a thickness-distribution equation and an enthalpy-distribution equation. Both equations have been implemented in a one-dimensional dynamic thermodynamic sea-ice model with 12 ice thickness categories following the numerical procedure of Hibler. The implementation of the enthalpy-distribution equation allows the sea-ice model to account for any changes in the ice thermal energy induced by sea ice processes. As a result, the model is able to conserve not only the ice mass but also its thermal energy in the presence of ice advection, growth, melting, and ridging. Conserving ice thermal energy in a thickness-distribution sea ice model improves the prediction of ice growth, summer ice melt in particular, and therefore ice thickness. Inability to...},

Simulations of the energy exchange processes in models would benefit if the ice concentration were represented more accurately. Reanalysis simulations that use historical wind and temperature fields may develop erroneous ice concentration estimates; these can be corrected by using observed ice concentration fields. The ice concentration assimilation presented here is a new method based on nudging the model ice concentration toward the observed concentration in a manner that emphasizes the ice extent and minimizes the effect of observational errors in the interior of the pack. The nudging weight is a nonlinear function of the difference between the model and the observed ice concentration.

A way forward is through further investigation of atmospheric dynamic mechanisms. During several exceptionally warm Arctic winters since 2007, sea ice loss in the Barents and Kara Seas initiated eastward-propagating wave trains of high and low pressure. Anomalous high pressure east of the Ural Mountains advected Arctic air over central and eastern Asia, resulting in persistent cold spells. Blocking near Greenland related to low-level temperature anomalies led to northerly flow into eastern North America, inducing persistent cold periods. Potential Arctic connections in Europe are less clear. Variability in the North Pacific can reinforce downstream Arctic changes, and Arctic amplification...},

General circulation models (GCMs) show that this trend is related to several factors, including North Atlantic SSTs, greenhouse gas/ozone-induced stratospheric cooling, and warming of the Indo-Pacific warm pool. Over the last approximately two decades, however, the AO has been decreasing, with 2009/10 featuring the most negative AO since 1900. Observational and idealized modeling studies suggest that snow cover, particularly over Eurasia, may be important. An observed snow–AO mechanism also exists, involving the vertical propagation of a Rossby wave train into the stratosphere, which induces a negative AO response that couples to the troposphere. Similar to other GCMs, the authors show that transient sim...},

Compositing analysis of stratospheric warming events identifies regional tropospheric precursors, which precede stratospheric warmings.

Prior to vortex displacements the main anomaly sea level pressure center of the tropospheric precursor is located across northwest Eurasia and is associated with the Siberian high.

The computed wave structures in the meridional section show good agreement with the observed state for the component of zonal wavenumber 1. For wavenumber 2, the computed amplitude is too small to compare with the observed. Wave energy density attains a maximum in the lower and middle stratosphere at high altitudes, where strong upward transfer of wave energy appears. A region of small latitudinal gradient of potential vorticity of the basic state is found above the tropospheric jet, which acts as a barrier for wave propagation and confines wave energy to the polar region.

Here we demonstrate that the decrease in autumn Arctic sea ice area is linked to changes in the winter Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation that have some resemblance to the negative phase of the winter Arctic oscillation. However, the atmospheric circulation change linked to the reduction of sea ice shows much broader meridional meanders in midlatitudes and clearly different interannual variability than the classical Arctic oscillation. This circulation change results in more frequent episodes of blocking patterns that lead to increased cold surges over large parts of northern continents. Moreover, the increase in atmospheric water vapor content in the Arctic region during late autumn and winter driven locally by the reduction of sea ice provides enhanced moisture sources, supporting increased heavy snowfall in Europe during early winter and the northeastern and midwestern United States during winter. We conclude that the recent decline of Arctic sea ice has played a critical role in recent cold and snowy winters.},

This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957–96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided b...},

Here, two sea ice thickness datasets as possible candidates for forecast initialization were investigated: the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS). Using Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data, it was shown that the PIOMAS dataset had a more realistic representation of sea ice thickness than CFSR. Subsequently, both March CFSR and PIOMAS sea ice thicknesses were used to initialize hindcasts using the Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), model. A second set of model runs was also done in which the original model physics were modified to more physically reasonable settings—namely, increasing the number of marine stratus clouds in the Arctic region and enabling realist...},

The CFSR was designed and executed as a global, high-resolution coupled atmosphere–ocean–land surface–sea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over this period. The current CFSR will be extended as an operational, real-time product into the future. New features of the CFSR include 1) coupling of the atmosphere and ocean during the generation of the 6-h guess field, 2) an interactive sea ice model, and 3) assimilation of satellite radiances by the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) scheme over the entire period. The CFSR global atmosphere resolution is ~38 km (T382) with 64 levels extending from the surface to 0.26 hPa. The global ocean's latitudinal spacing is 0.25° at the equator, extending to a global 0.5° beyond the tropics, with 40 levels to a depth of 4737 m.

In this experiment two ensembles of single-year model integrations are performed starting on 1 April, the approximate start of the ice melt season. By perturbing the initial conditions of sea ice thickness (SIT), declines in both sea ice concentration and SIT, which result in sea ice distributions that are similar to the recent sea ice minima of 2007 and 2012, are induced. In the ice loss regions there are strong (~3 K) local increases in sea surface temperature (SST); additionally, there are remote increases in SST in the central North Pacific and subpolar gyre in the North Atlantic. Over the central Arctic there are increases in surface air temperature (SAT) of ~8 K due to increases in ocean–atmosphere heat fluxes. There are increases in SAT over continental North America that are in good agreement with recent changes as seen by reanalysis data. It is estimated th...},

   abstract = {The National Snow and Ice Data Center's (NSIDC) Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) comprises three equal-area projections, combined with an infinite number of possible grid definitions. The EASE-Grid is based on a philosophy of digital mapping and gridding definitions developed at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The original, 25 kilometer grids were defined for data products generated by the NOAA/NASA Level 3 Passive Microwave Pathfinder Projects, which include gridded passive microwave brightness temperatures and related geophysical products derived from the brightness temperatures. However, the grids have been adopted by a number of other projects, including the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Polar Pathfinders, the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia (AARI) Sea Ice data, and NSIDC's EASE-Grid versions of the Global Land Cover Classification (GLCC) data and the International Permafrost Association Permafrost and Ground Ice Map. The gridding philosophy used to implement a library of software routines is based on the assumption that a gridded data set is completely defined by two abstractions, the map projection and an overlaid lattice of grid points, often referred to as "cells." The software may be used to define all standard projections, and convert gridded data between them. However, this presentation will be restricted to an overview of the family of specific projections and grids that we have called the NSIDC EASE-Grid, or simply EASE-Grid. The discussion will include how to define a map projection and grid definition in general, and our reasons for choosing equal-area projections and a spherical Earth model for our target applications in particular. It will include some examples of applications and an intercomparison between EASE-Grid data sets.},

Conceptually easy to understand, EASE-Grid suffers from limitations that make it impossible to format in the widely popular GeoTIFF convention without reprojection. Importing EASE-Grid data into standard mapping software packages is nontrivial and error-prone. This article defines a standard for an improved EASE-Grid 2.0 definition, addressing how the changes rectify issues with the original grid definition. Data distributed using the EASE-Grid 2.0 standard will be easier for users to import into standard software packages and will minimize common reprojection errors that users had encountered with the original EASE-Grid definition.},

The models were forced by historical emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for the 1850–2100 time period. For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The high...},

   abstract = {Future intensification of Amazon drought resulting from climate change may cause increased fire activity, tree mortality, and emissions of carbon to the atmosphere across large areas of Amazonia. To provide a basis for addressing these issues, we examine properties of recent and future meteorological droughts in the Amazon in 35 climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). We find that the CMIP5 climate models, as a group, simulate important properties of historical meteorological droughts in the Amazon. In addition, this group of models reproduces observed relationships between Amazon precipitation and regional sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans. Assuming the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario for future drivers of climate change, the models project increases in the frequency and geographic extent of meteorological drought in the eastern Amazon, and the opposite in the West. For the region as a whole, the CMIP5 models suggest that the area affected by mild and severe meteorological drought will nearly double and triple, respectively, by 2100. Extremes of wetness are also projected to increase after 2040. Specifically, the frequency of periods of unusual wetness and the area affected by unusual wetness are projected to increase after 2040 in the Amazon as a whole, including in locations where annual mean precipitation is projected to decrease. Our analyses suggest that continued emissions of greenhouse gases will increase the likelihood of extreme events that have been shown to alter and degrade Amazonian forests.},

   abstract = {<p>Sea ice thickness is a fundamental climate state variable that provides an integrated measure of changes in the high-latitude energy balance. However, observations of mean ice thickness have been sparse in time and space, making the construction of observation-based time series difficult. Moreover, different groups use a variety of methods and processing procedures to measure ice thickness, and each observational source likely has different and poorly characterized measurement and sampling errors. Observational sources used in this study include upward-looking sonars mounted on submarines or moorings, electromagnetic sensors on helicopters or aircraft, and lidar or radar altimeters on airplanes or satellites. Here we use a curve-fitting approach to determine the large-scale spatial and temporal variability of the ice thickness as well as the mean differences between the observation systems, using over 3000 estimates of the ice thickness. The thickness estimates are measured over spatial scales of approximately 50 km or time scales of 1 month, and the primary time period analyzed is 2000–2012 when the modern mix of observations is available. Good agreement is found between five of the systems, within 0.15 m, while systematic differences of up to 0.5 m are found for three others compared to the five. The trend in annual mean ice thickness over the Arctic Basin is −0.58 ± 0.07 m decade<sup>−1</sup> over the period 2000–2012. Applying our method to the period 1975–2012 for the central Arctic Basin where we have sufficient data (the SCICEX box), we find that the annual mean ice thickness has decreased from 3.59 m in 1975 to 1.25 m in 2012, a 65% reduction. This is nearly double the 36% decline reported by an earlier study. These results provide additional direct observational evidence of substantial sea ice losses found in model analyses.</p>},

   abstract = {Projections of Arctic sea ice thickness (SIT) have the potential to inform stakeholders about accessibility to the region, but are currently rather uncertain. The latest suite of CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs) produce a wide range of simulated SIT in the historical period (1979–2014) and exhibit various biases when compared with the Pan-Arctic Ice–Ocean Modelling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) sea ice reanalysis. We present a new method to constrain such GCM simulations of SIT via a statistical bias correction technique. The bias correction successfully constrains the spatial SIT distribution and temporal variability in the CMIP5 projections whilst retaining the climatic fluctuations from individual ensemble members. The bias correction acts to reduce the spread in projections of SIT and reveals the significant contributions of climate internal variability in the first half of the century and of scenario uncertainty from the mid-century onwards. The projected date of ice-free conditions in the Arctic under the RCP8.5 high emission scenario occurs in the 2050s, which is a decade earlier than without the bias correction, with potentially significant implications for stakeholders in the Arctic such as the shipping industry. The bias correction methodology developed could be similarly applied to other variables to reduce spread in climate projections more generally.},

   abstract = {<p>Arctic sea ice thickness distributions from models participating in the World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are evaluated against observations from submarines, aircraft and satellites. While it is encouraging that the mean thickness distributions from the models are in general agreement with observations, the spatial patterns of sea ice thickness are poorly represented in most models. The poor spatial representation of thickness patterns is associated with a failure of models to represent details of the mean atmospheric circulation pattern that governs the transport and spatial distribution of sea ice. The climate models as a whole also tend to underestimate the rate of ice volume loss from 1979 to 2013, though the multimodel ensemble mean trend remains within the uncertainty of that from the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System. Although large uncertainties in observational products complicate model evaluations, these results raise concerns regarding the ability of CMIP5 models to realistically represent the processes driving the decline of Arctic sea ice and to project the timing of when a seasonally ice-free Arctic may become a reality.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Sea ice volume has decreased in the last decades, evoked by changes in sea ice area and thickness. Estimates of sea ice area and thickness rely on a number of geophysical parameters which introduce large uncertainties. To quantify these uncertainties we use freeboard retrievals from ICESat and investigate different assumptions about snow depth, sea ice density and area. We find that uncertainties in ice area are of minor importance for the estimates of sea ice volume during the cold season in the Arctic basin. The choice of mean ice density used when converting sea ice freeboard into thickness mainly influences the resulting mean sea ice thickness, while snow depth on top of the ice is the main driver for the year-to-year variability, particularly in late winter. The absolute uncertainty in the mean sea ice thickness is 0.28 m in February/March and 0.21 m in October/November. The uncertainty in snow depth contributes up to 70% of the total uncertainty and the ice density 30–35%, with higher values in October/November. We find large uncertainties in the total sea ice volume and trend. The mean total sea ice volume is 10 120 ± 1280 km<sup>3</sup> in October/November and 13 250 ± 1860 km<sup>3</sup> in February/March for the time period 2005–2007. Based on these uncertainties we obtain trends in sea ice volume of &minus;1450 ± 530 km<sup>3</sup> a<sup>&minus;1</sup> in October/November and &minus;880 ± 260 km<sup>3</sup> a<sup>&minus;1</sup> in February/March over the ICESat period (2003–2008). Our results indicate that, taking into account the uncertainties, the decline in sea ice volume in the Arctic between the ICESat (2003–2008) and CryoSat-2 (2010–2012) periods may have been less dramatic than reported in previous studies. However, more work and validation is required to quantify these changes and analyse possible unresolved biases in the freeboard retrievals.</p>},

   abstract = {AbstractThe future change of September Arctic sea-ice volume, simulated by 30 state-of-the-art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), is examined, which depends on both ice extent and ice thickness. In comparison with the September sea-ice extent, the September sea-ice volume has larger spread in the historical simulation but faster convergence in the projection simulation, especially in the context of increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This indicates that the ice volume might be more sensitive to external forcings than the ice extent. Using the averaged projection of those climate models from the 30 CMIP5 models that can better reflect the ‘observed’ sea-ice volume climatology and variability, it is shown that the September sea ice volume will decrease to ~3000 km3 in the early 2060s, and then level off under a medium-mitigation scenario. However, it will drop to ~3000 km3 in the early 2040s and reach a near-zero ice volume in the mid-2070s under a high-emission ...},

The satellite products are based on three different retrieval methods: an energy budget approach, measurements of ice freeboard, and the relationship between passive microwave brightness temperatures and thin ice thickness. Inter-comparisons are done for the periods of overlap from 2003 to 2013. Results show that ICESat sea ice is thicker than APP-x and PIOMAS overall, particularly along the north coast of Greenland and Canadian Archipelago. The relative differences of APP-x and PIOMAS with ICESat are −0.48 m and −0.31 m, respectively. APP-x underestimates thickness relative to CryoSat-2, with a mean difference of −0.19 m. The biases for APP-x, PIOMAS, and CryoSat-2 relative to IceBridge thicknesses are 0.18 m, 0.18 m, and 0.29 m. The mean difference between SMOS and CryoSat-2 for 0~1 m thick ice is 0.13 m in March and −0.24 m in October. All satellite-retrieved ice thickness products and PIOMAS overestimate the thickness of thin ice (1 m or less) compared to IceBridge for which SMOS has the smallest bias (0.26 m). The spatial correlation between the datasets indicates that APP-x and PIOMAS are the most similar, followed by APP-x and CryoSat-2.},

Although it is possible to calculate Arctic sea ice thickness using measurements acquired by CryoSat-2, the latency of the final release data set is typically 1 month due to the time required to determine precise satellite orbits. We use a new fast-delivery CryoSat-2 data set based on preliminary orbits to compute Arctic sea ice thickness in near real time (NRT), and analyse this data for one sea ice growth season from October 2014 to April 2015. We show that this NRT sea-ice-thickness product is of comparable accuracy to that produced using the final release CryoSat-2 data, with a mean thickness difference of 0.9 cm, demonstrating that the satellite orbit is not a critical factor in determining sea ice freeboard. In addition, the CryoSat-2 fast-delivery product also provides measurements of Arctic sea ice thickness within 3 days of acquisition by the satellite, and a measurement is delivered, on average, within 14, 7 and 6 km of each location in the Arctic every 2, 14 and 28 days respectively. The CryoSat-2 NRT sea-ice-thickness data set provides an additional constraint for short-term and seasonal predictions of changes in the Arctic ice cover and could support industries such as tourism and transport through assimilation in operational models.</p>},

   abstract = {Abstract The minimum of Arctic sea ice extent in the summer of 2007 was unprecedented in the historical record. A coupled ice–ocean model is used to determine the state of the ice and ocean over the past 29 yr to investigate the causes of this ice extent minimum within a historical perspective. It is found that even though the 2007 ice extent was strongly anomalous, the loss in total ice mass was not. Rather, the 2007 ice mass loss is largely consistent with a steady decrease in ice thickness that began in 1987. Since then, the simulated mean September ice thickness within the Arctic Ocean has declined from 3.7 to 2.6 m at a rate of −0.57 m decade−1. Both the area coverage of thin ice at the beginning of the melt season and the total volume of ice lost in the summer have been steadily increasing. The combined impact of these two trends caused a large reduction in the September mean ice concentration in the Arctic Ocean. This created conditions during the summer of 2007 that allowed persistent winds to pus...},

   abstract = {As a first step in investigating the effects of sea ice changes on the climate sensitivity to doubled atmospheric CO2, the authors use a standard simple sea ice model while varying the sea ice distributions and thicknesses in the control run. Thinner ice amplifies the atmospheric temperature sensitivity in these experiments by about 15% (to a warming of 4.8°C), because it is easier for the thinner ice to be removed as the climate warms. Thus, its impact on sensitivity is similar to that of greater sea ice extent in the control run, which provides more opportunity for sea ice reduction. An experiment with sea ice not allowed to change between the control and doubled CO2 simulations illustrates that the total effect of sea ice on surface air temperature changes, including cloud cover and water vapor feedbacks that arise in response to sea ice variations, amounts to 37% of the temperature sensitivity to the CO2 doubling, accounting for 1.56°C of the 4.17°C global warming.

The dipole anomaly corresponds to the second-leading mode of EOF of monthly mean sea level pressure (SLP) north of 70°N during the winter season (October–March) and accounts for 13% of the variance. One of its two anomalous centers is stably occupied between the Kara Sea and Laptev Sea; the other is situated from the Canadian Archipelago through Greenland extending southeastward to the Nordic seas. The dipole anomaly differs from one described in other papers that can be attributed to an eastward shift of the center of action of the North Atlantic Oscillation.

This paper discusses the Connection Machine implementation of the model and its performance, as well as major changes that were made in the algorithms and numerical methods. In order to increase the parallel efficiency, we reformulated the barotropic equations to solve for the surface-pressure field rather than the volume-transport streamfunction. In addition to being more efficient, this method has several other advantages over the streamfunction formulation: (1) any number of islands can be included in the computational grid at no extra cost; (2) the model can handle steep gradients in the bottom topography; and (3) the free-surface height is a prognostic variable, which simplifies assimilation of altimetric data into the model. We have also developed a new parallelizable preconditioning method for the solution of the elliptic equation for the surface-pressure field. In order to use a standard conjugate gradient algorithm, an approximate-factorization technique is used to split off the Coriolis terms and obtain a symmetric operator. We then apply a symmetric local approximate-inverse operator as a preconditioning matrix, which is very effective in accelerating convergence to a solution.},

In this study sea ice thickness variability is characterized in fully coupled GCMs and sea ice–ocean-only models (IOMs) that are forced with an estimate of observations derived from atmospheric reanalysis and satellite measurements. Overall, variance in sea ice thickness is greatest along Arctic Ocean coastlines. Sea ice thickness anomalies have a typical time scale of about 6–20 months, a time scale that lengthens about a season when accounting for ice transport, and a typical length scale of about 500–1000 km. The range of these scales across GCMs implies that an estimate of the number of thickness monitoring locations needed to characterize the full Arctic basin sea ice thickness variability field is model dependent and would vary between 3 and 14.

   abstract = {Satellite observations reveal a substantial decline in September Arctic sea ice extent since 1979, which has played a leading role in the observed recent Arctic surface warming and has often been attributed, in large part, to the increase in greenhouse gases. However, the most rapid decline occurred during the recent global warming hiatus period. Previous studies are often focused on a single mechanism for changes and variations of summer Arctic sea ice extent, and many are based on short observational records. The key players for summer Arctic sea ice extent variability at multidecadal/centennial time scales and their contributions to the observed summer Arctic sea ice decline are not well understood. Here a multiple regression model is developed for the first time, to the author's knowledge, to provide a framework to quantify the contributions of three key predictors (Atlantic/Pacific heat transport into the Arctic, and Arctic Dipole) to the internal low-frequency variability of Summer Arctic sea ice extent, using a 3,600-y-long control climate model simulation. The results suggest that changes in these key predictors could have contributed substantially to the observed summer Arctic sea ice decline. If the ocean heat transport into the Arctic were to weaken in the near future due to internal variability, there might be a hiatus in the decline of September Arctic sea ice. The modeling results also suggest that at multidecadal/centennial time scales, variations in the atmosphere heat transport across the Arctic Circle are forced by anticorrelated variations in the Atlantic heat transport into the Arctic.},

   abstract = {Month-by-month ranking of 37years (1979–2015) of satellite-derived sea-ice extents in the Arctic and Antarctic reveals interesting new details in the overall trends toward decreasing sea-ice coverage in the Arctic and increasing sea-ice coverage in the Antarctic. The Arctic decreases are so definitive that there has not been a monthly record high in Arctic sea-ice extents in any month since 1986, a time period during which there have been 75 monthly record lows. The Antarctic, with the opposite but weaker trend toward increased ice extents, experienced monthly record lows in 5months of 1986, then 6 later monthly record lows scattered through the dataset, with the last two occurring in 2006, versus 45 record highs since 1986. However, in the last three years of the 1979–2015 dataset, the downward trends in Arctic sea-ice extents eased up, with no new record lows in any month of 2013 or 2014 and only one record low in 2015, while the upward trends in Antarctic ice extents notably strengthened, with new record high ice extents in 4months (August–November) of 2013, in 6months (April–September) of 2014, and in 3months (January, April, and May) of 2015. Globally, there have been only 3 monthly record highs since 1986 (only one since 1988), whereas there have been 43 record lows, although the last record lows (in the 1979–2015 dataset) occurred in 2012.},

   abstract = {Abstract Recent observations of summer Arctic sea ice over the satellite era show that record or near-record lows for the ice extent occurred in the years 2002–05. To determine the physical processes contributing to these changes in the Arctic pack ice, model results from a regional coupled ice–ocean model have been analyzed. Since 1988 the thickness of the simulated basinwide ice thinned by 1.31 m or 43%. The thinning is greatest along the coast in the sector from the Chukchi Sea to the Beaufort Sea to Greenland. It is hypothesized that the thinning since 1988 is due to preconditioning, a trigger, and positive feedbacks: 1) the fall, winter, and spring air temperatures over the Arctic Ocean have gradually increased over the last 50 yr, leading to reduced thickness of first-year ice at the start of summer; 2) a temporary shift, starting in 1989, of two principal climate indexes (the Arctic Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) caused a flushing of some of the older, thicker ice out of the basin and...},

The dominant mode of winter (January–March) sea ice variability exhibits out-of-phase fluctuations between the western and eastern North Atlantic, together with a weaker dipole in the North Pacific. The time series of this mode has a high winter-to-winter autocorrelation (0.69) and is dominated by decadal-scale variations and a longer-term trend of diminishing ice cover east of Greenland and increasing ice cover west of Greenland. Associated with the dominant pattern of winter sea ice variability are large-scale changes in SAT and SLP that closely resemble the North Atlantic oscillation. The associated SAT and surface sensible and latent heat flux anomalies are largest over the portions of the marginal sea ice zone in which the tr...},

   abstract = {<p>In the context of quantifying Arctic ice-volume decrease at global scale, the CryoSat-2 satellite was launched in 2010 and is equipped with the <i>K</i><sub>u</sub> band synthetic aperture radar altimeter SIRAL (Synthetic Aperture Interferometric Radar Altimeter), which we use to derive sea-ice freeboard defined as the height of the ice surface above the sea level. Accurate CryoSat-2 range measurements over open water and the ice surface of the order of centimetres are necessary to achieve the required accuracy of the freeboard-to-thickness conversion. Besides uncertainties of the actual sea-surface height and limited knowledge of ice and snow properties, the composition of radar backscatter and therefore the interpretation of radar echoes is crucial. This has consequences in the selection of retracker algorithms which are used to track the main scattering horizon and assign a range estimate to each CryoSat-2 measurement. In this study we apply a retracker algorithm with thresholds of 40, 50 and 80% of the first maximum of radar echo power, spanning the range of values used in the current literature. By using the selected retrackers and additionally results from airborne validation measurements, we evaluate the uncertainties of sea-ice freeboard and higher-level products that arise from the choice of the retracker threshold only, independent of the uncertainties related to snow and ice properties. Our study shows that the choice of retracker thresholds does have a significant impact on magnitudes of estimates of sea-ice freeboard and thickness, but that the spatial distributions of these parameters are less affected. Specifically we find mean radar freeboard values of 0.121 m (0.265 m) for the 40% threshold, 0.086 m (0.203 m) for the 50% threshold and 0.024 m (0.092 m) for the 80% threshold, considering first-year ice (multiyear ice) in March 2013. We show that the main source of freeboard and thickness uncertainty results from the choice of the retracker and the unknown penetration of the radar pulse into the snow layer in conjunction with surface roughness effects. These uncertainties can cause a freeboard bias of roughly 0.06–0.12 m. Furthermore we obtain a significant rise of 0.02–0.15 m of freeboard from March 2013 to November 2013 in the area for multiyear sea ice north of Greenland and Canada. Since this is unlikely, it gives rise to the assumption that applying different retracker thresholds depending on seasonal properties of the snow load is necessary in the future.</p>},

The skill of several predictors of the pan-Arctic sea ice area was quantified: the sea ice area itself, the pan-Arctic sea ice volume, and some areal predictors built from the subgrid ice thickness distribution (ITD). Sea ice area provides a potential predictability of about 3 months, which is consistent with previous studies using model and observation data. Sea ice volume predictive skill for winter sea ice area prediction is weak. Nevertheless, there is a higher potential to predict the September ice area with the June volume anomaly than with the June area anomaly. Using ITD-based predictors, two “regimes” of predictability were highlighted. The first one, a “persistence regime,” applies to winter/early spring sea ice seasonal predictability.

   abstract = {<p>An observation product for thin sea ice thickness (SMOS-Ice) is derived from the brightness temperature data of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. This product is available in near-real time, at daily frequency, during the cold season. In this study, we investigate the benefit of assimilating SMOS-Ice into the TOPAZ coupled ocean and sea ice forecasting system, which is the Arctic component of the Copernicus marine environment monitoring services. The TOPAZ system assimilates sea surface temperature (SST), altimetry data, temperature and salinity profiles, ice concentration, and ice drift with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The conditions for assimilation of sea ice thickness thinner than 0.4 m are favorable, as observations are reliable below this threshold and their probability distribution is comparable to that of the model. Two parallel Observing System Experiments (OSE) have been performed in March and November 2014, in which the thicknesses from SMOS-Ice (thinner than 0.4 m) are assimilated in addition to the standard observational data sets. It is found that the root mean square difference (RMSD) of thin sea ice thickness is reduced by 11 % in March and 22 % in November compared to the daily thin ice thicknesses of SMOS-Ice, which suggests that SMOS-Ice has a larger impact during the beginning of the cold season. Validation against independent observations of ice thickness from buoys and ice draft from moorings indicates that there are no degradations in the pack ice but there are some improvements near the ice edge close to where the SMOS-Ice has been assimilated. Assimilation of SMOS-Ice yields a slight improvement for ice concentration and degrades neither SST nor sea level anomaly. Analysis of the degrees of freedom for signal (DFS) indicates that the SMOS-Ice has a comparatively small impact but it has a significant contribution in constraining the system (&amp;gt; 20 % of the impact of all ice and ocean observations) near the ice edge. The areas of largest impact are the Kara Sea, Canadian Archipelago, Baffin Bay, Beaufort Sea and Greenland Sea. This study suggests that the SMOS-Ice is a good complementary data set that can be safely included in the TOPAZ system.</p>},

   abstract = {Due to its persistence on seasonal timescales, Arctic sea-ice thickness (SIT) is a potential source of predictability for summer sea-ice extent (SIE). New satellite observations of SIT represent an opportunity to harness this potential predictability via improved thickness initialization in seasonal forecast systems. In this work, the evolution of Arctic sea-ice volume anomalies is studied using a 700-year control integration and a suite of initialized ensemble forecasts from a fully-coupled global climate model. Our analysis is focused on the September sea-ice zone, as this is the region where thickness anomalies have the potential to impact the SIE minimum. The primary finding of this paper is that, in addition to a general decay with time, sea-ice volume anomalies display a summer enhancement, in which anomalies tend to grow between the months of May and July. This summer enhancement is relatively symmetric for positive and negative volume anomalies and peaks in July regardless of the initial m...},

It is found that the vertical structure of the warming associated with moist intrusions is bottom amplified, corresponding to a transition of local conditions from a “cold clear” state with a strong inversion to a “warm opaque” state with a weaker inversion. In the marginal sea ice zone of the Barents Sea, the passage of an intrusion also causes a retreat of the ice margin, which persists for many days after the intrusion has passed. The authors find that there is a positive trend in the number of intrusion events crossing 70°N during December and January that can explain roughly 45% of the surface air temperature and 30% of the sea ice concentration trends observed in the Barents Sea during the past two decades.},

We find that the models’ total zonally-integrated northward moisture flux agrees reasonably well with the reanalysis, but with large compensating regional biases. Specifically, the models systematically underpredict the moisture flux in the Atlantic sector and overpredict it in the Pacific sector. The biases are predominantly due to misrepresentation of extreme moisture flux events, which are know to exert a significant control on Arctic climate. Biases in these high-intensity fluxes are almost entirely contributed by biases in the meridional velocity, suggesting a link with biases in storm track activity at lower latitudes. We assess the extent to which the deficit of moisture intrusions in the Atlantic sector and excess in the Pacific sector may account for biases in the climate of the respective sectors.

   abstract = {Rapid Arctic warming and sea-ice reduction in the Arctic Ocean are widely attributed to anthropogenic climate change. The Arctic warming exceeds the global average warming because of feedbacks that include sea-ice reduction and other dynamical and radiative feedbacks. We find that the most prominent annual mean surface and tropospheric warming in the Arctic since 1979 has occurred in northeastern Canada and Greenland. In this region, much of the year-to-year temperature variability is associated with the leading mode of large-scale circulation variability in the North Atlantic, namely, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Here we show that the recent warming in this region is strongly associated with a negative trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation, which is a response to anomalous Rossby wave-train activity originating in the tropical Pacific. Atmospheric model experiments forced by prescribed tropical sea surface temperatures simulate the observed circulation changes and associated tropospheric and surface warming over northeastern Canada and Greenland. Experiments from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (ref. 16) models with prescribed anthropogenic forcing show no similar circulation changes related to the North Atlantic Oscillation or associated tropospheric warming. This suggests that a substantial portion of recent warming in the northeastern Canada and Greenland sector of the Arctic arises from unforced natural variability.},

The response of Arctic sea ice to these atmospheric changes has been studied with a thickness distribution sea-ice model coupled to an ocean model. During a period of high NAO, 1989–96, the model shows a substantial reduction of ice advection into the eastern Arctic from the Canada Basin, and an increase of ice export through Fram Strait, both of which tend to deplete thick ice in the eastern Arctic Ocean and enhance it in the western Arctic, in an uneven dipolar pattern we call the East–West Arctic Anomaly Pattern (EWAAP). From the period 1979–88 with a lower-NAO index to the period 1988–96 with a high-NAO index, the simulated ice volume in the eastern Arctic drops by about a quarter, while that in the western Arctic increases by ...},

Polar climate change provides new opportunities, such as shorter shipping routes between Europe and East Asia, but also new risks such as the potential for industrial accidents or emergencies in ice-covered seas. Here, it is argued that environmental prediction systems for the polar regions are less developed than elsewhere. There are many reasons for this situation, including the polar regions being (historically) lower priority, with fewer in situ observations, and with numerous local physical processes that are less well represented by models. By contrasting the relative importance of different physical processes in polar and lower latitudes, the need for a dedicated polar prediction effort is illustrated. Research priorities are identified that will help to advance environmental polar prediction capabilities. Examples include an improvement of the p...},

Statistical analyses of observations show that enhanced poleward moisture transport from the North Pacific to the Arctic Ocean contributed to the accelerated SIA decrease during the most recent period. As a consequence, specific humidity in the Arctic Pacific sector significantly increased along with an increase of downward longwave radiation beginning in 2002, which led to a significant acceleration in the decline of SIA in the Arctic Pacific sector. The resulting sea ice loss lead to increased evaporation in the Arctic Ocean resulting in a further increase of the specific humidity in mid-to-late fall, thus acting as a positive feedback to the sea ice loss. The overall set of processes is also found in a long control simulation of a coupled climate model.},

These leads can be observed in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images under predominantly clear sky conditions. Sea ice concentrations (SIC) derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) using the Bootstrap (BST) algorithm fail to show the lead occurrences, as is visible in the MODIS images. In contrast, SIC derived from AMSR2 using the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study (ARTIST) sea ice algorithm (ASI) reveal the lead structure, due to the higher spatial resolution possible when using 89-GHz channel data. The ASI SIC are calculated from brightness temperatures interpolated on three different grids with resolutions of 3.125 km (ASI-3k), 6.25 km (ASI-6k) and 12.5 km (ASI-12k) to investigate the effect of the spatial resolution. Single-swath data is used to study the effect of temporal sampling in comparison to daily averages. For a region of interest in the Beaufort Sea, BST and ASI-3k show area-averaged SIC of 97%±0.7% and 93%±7.0%, respectively. For ASI-6k, the area-averaged SIC are similar to ASI-3k, while ASI-12k data show more agreement with BST. Visual comparison with MODIS True Color imagery exhibits good agreement with ASI-3k. In particular, ASI-3k are able to reproduce lead structure and size in the sea ice cover, which are not or are less visible in the other SIC data. The results will be valuable for selecting a SIC data product for studies of the interaction between ocean, ice, and atmosphere in the polar regions.},

The data show a 3-hPa decrease in decadal mean SLP over the central Arctic Ocean between 1979–88 and 1989–98. This decrease in SLP drives a cyclonic trend in SIM, which resembles the structure of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Regression maps of SIM during the wintertime (January–March) AO index show 1) an increase in ice advection away from the coast of the East Siberian and Laptev Seas, which should have the effect of producing more new thin ice in the coastal flaw leads; 2) a decrease in ice advection from the western Arctic into the eastern Arctic; and 3) a slight increase in ice advection out of the Arctic through Fram Strait. Taken together, these changes suggest that at least part of the thinning of sea ice recently observed ov...},

   abstract = {<p>Sea ice concentration has been retrieved in polar regions with satellite microwave radiometers for over 30 years. However, the question remains as to what is an optimal sea ice concentration retrieval method for climate monitoring. This paper presents some of the key results of an extensive algorithm inter-comparison and evaluation experiment. The skills of 30 sea ice algorithms were evaluated systematically over low and high sea ice concentrations. Evaluation criteria included standard deviation relative to independent validation data, performance in the presence of thin ice and melt ponds, and sensitivity to error sources with seasonal to inter-annual variations and potential climatic trends, such as atmospheric water vapour and water-surface roughening by wind. A selection of 13 algorithms is shown in the article to demonstrate the results. Based on the findings, a hybrid approach is suggested to retrieve sea ice concentration globally for climate monitoring purposes. This approach consists of a combination of two algorithms plus dynamic tie points implementation and atmospheric correction of input brightness temperatures. The method minimizes inter-sensor calibration discrepancies and sensitivity to the mentioned error sources.</p>},

Ice and water observations are obtained from a set of SAR images by thresholding ice and water probabilities calculated using a supervised maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). These ice and water observations are then assimilated in combination with ice concentration from passive microwave imagery for the purpose of estimating sea ice concentration. Due to the fact that the observations are binary, consisting of zeros and ones, while the state vector is a continuous variable (ice concentration), the forward model used to map the state vector to the observation space requires special consideration. Both linear and non-linear forward models were investigated. In both cases, the assimilation of SAR data was able to produce ice concentration analyses in closer agreement with image analysis charts than when assimilating passive microwave data only.

   abstract = {<p>A new long-term data record of Fram Strait sea ice area export from 1935 to 2014 is developed using a combination of satellite radar images and station observations of surface pressure across Fram Strait. This data record shows that the long-term annual mean export is about 880?000?km<sup>2</sup>, representing 10?% of the sea-ice-covered area inside the basin. The time series has large interannual and multi-decadal variability but no long-term trend. However, during the last decades, the amount of ice exported has increased, with several years having annual ice exports that exceeded 1?million?km<sup>2</sup>. This increase is a result of faster southward ice drift speeds due to stronger southward geostrophic winds, largely explained by increasing surface pressure over Greenland. Evaluating the trend onwards from 1979 reveals an increase in annual ice export of about +6?% per decade, with spring and summer showing larger changes in ice export (+11?% per decade) compared to autumn and winter (+2.6?% per decade). Increased ice export during winter will generally result in new ice growth and contributes to thinning inside the Arctic Basin. Increased ice export during summer or spring will, in contrast, contribute directly to open water further north and a reduced summer sea ice extent through the ice?albedo feedback. Relatively low spring and summer export from 1950 to 1970 is thus consistent with a higher mid-September sea ice extent for these years. Our results are not sensitive to long-term change in Fram Strait sea ice concentration. We find a general moderate influence between export anomalies and the following September sea ice extent, explaining 18?% of the variance between 1935 and 2014, but with higher values since 2004.</p>},

Temperature has been observed almost continuously in Svalbard since 1898, although at different sites. It has therefore been possible to create one composite series for Svalbard Airport covering the period 1898–2012, and this valuable new record is presented here. The series reveals large temperature variability on Spitsbergen, with the early 20th century warming as one striking feature: an abrupt change from the cold 1910s to the local maxima of the 1930s and 1950s. With the inclusion of the new data it is possible to show that the 1910s were colder than the years at the start of the series.

State-of-the-art climate models, by contrast, typically simulate a moderate decrease in both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice covers. However, in each hemisphere there is a small subset of model simulations that have sea ice trends similar to the observations. Based on this, a number of recent studies have suggested that the models are consistent with the observations in each hemisphere when simulated internal climate variability is taken into account. Here we examine sea ice changes during 1979-2013 in simulations from the most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) as well as the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), drawing on previous work that found a close relationship in climate models between global-mean surface temperature and sea ice extent.

During the Arctic winter, a variation of downward longwave radiation (DLR) is fundamental in modulating Arctic surface temperature. In the warm Arctic winter, DLR and precipitable water (PW) are increasing over the entire Arctic; however, the major drivers for such increases differ regionally. In areas such as the northern Greenland Sea, increasing DLR and PW are caused mainly by convergence of atmospheric energy transport from lower latitudes. In regions of maximum sea-ice retreat (e.g., northern Barents–Kara seas), continued sea-ice melting from previous seasons drive the DLR and PW increases, consistent with the positive ice-insulation feedback. Distinct local feedbacks between open-water and ice-retreat regions were further compared. In open-water regions, a reduced ocean–atmosphere temperat...},

One of the benefits hoped to achieve over GEMPAK is to make it easier to use these routines for any meteorological Python application; this means making it easy to pull out the LCL calculation and just use that, or re-use the Skew-T with your own data code. MetPy also prides itself on being well-documented and well-tested, so that on-going maintenance is easily manageable.

The intended audience is that of GEMPAK: researchers, educators, and any one wanting to script up weather analysis. It doesn't even have to be scripting; all python meteorology tools are hoped to be able to benefit from MetPy.

   abstract = {Abstract Submarine measurements of sea ice draft show that the ice has thinned in some parts of the Arctic Ocean at a remarkably high rate over the past few decades. The spatial pattern indicates that the thinning was a strong function of ice thickness, with the greatest thinning occurring where the ice was initially thickest. A similar relationship between sea ice thinning and the initial thickness is reproduced individually by three global climate models in response to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the models' atmosphere. All three models have weak trends in their surface winds and one model lacks ice dynamics altogether, implying that trends in the atmosphere or ice circulation are not necessary to produce a relatively high rate of thinning over the central Arctic or a thickness change that increases with the initial thickness. A general theory is developed to describe the thinning of sea ice subjected to climate perturbations, and it is found that the leading component of the thickness depende...},

   abstract = {Climate change is amplified in the Arctic region. Arctic amplification has been found in past warm 1 and glacial 2 periods, as well as in historical observations 3,4 and climate model experiments 5,6 . Feedback eeects associated with tem-perature, water vapour and clouds have been suggested to contribute to amplified warming in the Arctic, but the surface albedo feedback—the increase in surface absorption of solar radiation when snow and ice retreat—is often cited as the main contributor 7–10 . However, Arctic amplification is also found in models without changes in snow and ice cover 11,12 . Here we analyse climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archive to quantify the contributions of the various feedbacks. We find that in the simulations, the largest contribution to Arctic amplification comes from a temperature feedbacks: as the surface warms, more energy is radiated back to space in low latitudes, compared with the Arctic. This eeect can be attributed to both the diierent vertical structure of the warming in high and low latitudes, and a smaller increase in emitted blackbody radiation per unit warming at colder temperatures. We find that the surface albedo feedback is the second main contributor to Arctic amplification and that other contributions are substantially smaller or even oppose Arctic amplification. A quantitative understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying Arctic amplification is key to developing confidence in and constraining model projections of Arctic climate change, and to focusing research efforts and model–data comparisons on the most important processes. It is well established that Arctic amplification is in part caused by the surface albedo feedback 5,11,13 . Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fourth assessment report stated that it was not clear whether the surface albedo feedback was the main cause of Arctic amplification 14 , many recent studies indicate or assume that surface albedo feedback is the main cause 7–10 . However, Arctic amplification does occur in models without surface albedo feedback 11,12 and Arctic amplification in coupled climate models (Fig. 1) has been shown to be primarily caused by feedbacks acting on terrestrial longwave radiation 15 . The latter implies that the surface albedo feedback, which changes the absorption of solar shortwave radiation, can play only a secondary role in causing Arctic amplification. Important contributions to Arctic amplification have been suggested to result from the water vapour feedback caused by the greenhouse effect of additional water vapour 12 , the cloud feedback due to changes in the effect of clouds on the Earth's radiative balance 16 and the lapse-rate feedback associated with the vertical structure of warming 5,17 . Changes in atmospheric 18 and oceanic heat transport 6,19,20 are also thought to contribute to Arctic amplification. The direct impact of rising temperatures on outgoing longwave radiation at the top of atmosphere (TOA; temperature feedback) can be decomposed into a contribution from vertically uniform warming of the surface and troposphere (Planck feedback) and a contribution from tropospheric warming that deviates from the vertically uniform profile (lapse-rate feedback). The lapse-rate feedback connected to the vertical structure of atmospheric warming is known to contribute to stronger Arctic than tropical warming 5,17 . In the tropics, air parcels rising in deep convective clouds create a tight coupling between surface and upper-tropospheric temperatures. In a warming climate, these air parcels release more latent heat, steepening the moist adiabatic lapse rate and thus causing greater warming in the upper troposphere than at the surface. Under this top-heavy warming profile, a smaller increase in surface temperatures is required to offset a given TOA imbalance. In the Arctic, cold dense air close to the surface is hardly mixed with the lighter air aloft, leaving radiation as the primary coupling mechanism. Radiative coupling does not impose a certain lapse rate and surface-based warming remains confined to the lowermost parts of the atmosphere. Under this bottom-heavy warming profile, a larger increase in surface temperatures is required to offset a given TOA imbalance. The lapse-rate feedback is therefore negative in the tropics and positive in the Arctic. The Planck feedback is generally overlooked as a contributor to Arctic amplification, even though the underlying physics is well established 21 . The longwave radiation (R) emitted by the Earth's surface rises with temperature (T) following R = σ T 4 , where is the surface emissivity close to unity and σ the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. Thus, a given increase in emitted radiation requires a larger temperature increase at colder background temperatures. For example, at 30 • C, an external forcing of 1 W m −2 can be balanced by a 0.16 • C warming, whereas at −30 • C a 0.31 • C warming is required to balance the same forcing. As the Arctic is colder than the tropics, the Planck feedback in itself causes Arctic amplification. The local temperature change required to offset the radiative imbalance caused by a given forcing or feedback corresponds to that mechanism's warming contribution. We assess indi-vidual contributions to Arctic amplification as the difference between contributions to Arctic and tropical warming (Fig. 2). Beyond the simple example quoted above, and accounting for the effects of atmosphere and clouds, the radiative flux change at the surface and TOA associated to a known surface temperature change can be computed from radiative kernels 22 . We here invert the kernel method to compute the local warming contributions of the feedbacks. The contribution of the Planck feedback's spatial structure to the spatial structure of warming is estimated as the difference between the warm-ing response for a globally averaged and for the local Planck feedback (Methods).},

AA is found to promote regionally varying ridging aloft (500 hPa) with strong seasonal differences reflecting the location of the strongest surface thermal forcing. During winter, maximum increases in future geopotential heights are centered over the Arctic Ocean, in conjunction with sea ice loss, but minimum height increases (troughing) occur to the south, over the continental United States.

A highly uncertain area of scientific research, however, is whether such Arctic change has a tangible effect on weather and climate at lower latitudes. There is emerging evidence that the geographical location of sea ice loss is critically important in determining the large-scale atmospheric circulation response and associated midlatitude impacts. However, such regional dependencies have not been explored in a thorough and systematic manner. To make progress on this issue, this study analyzes ensemble simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model prescribed with sea ice loss separately in nine regions of the Arctic, to elucidate the distinct responses to regional sea ice loss. The results suggest that in some regions, sea ice loss triggers large-scale dynamical responses, whereas in other regions sea ice loss induces only local thermodynamical changes.

Although these cold winters are thought to be partly driven by dramatic losses of Arctic sea-ice, the mechanism that links sea-ice loss to cold winters remains a subject of debate. Here, by conducting observational analyses and model experiments, we show how Arctic sea-ice loss and cold winters in extra-polar regions are dynamically connected through the polar stratosphere. We find that decreased sea-ice cover during early winter months (November– December), especially over the Barents–Kara seas, enhances the upward propagation of planetary-scale waves with wavenumbers of 1 and 2, subsequently weakening the strato-spheric polar vortex in mid-winter (January–February). The weakened polar vortex preferentially induces a negative phase of Arctic Oscillation at the surface, resulting in low temperatures in mid-latitudes.},

This EOF analysis captures a strong linkage between the vertical component of lower-stratospheric wave activity over Eurasia and the subsequent development of hemisphere-wide surface circulation anomalies, which are strongly related to the Arctic Oscillation. Wintertime stratosphere–troposphere events picked out by this diagnostic often have a precursor in autumn: years with large October snow extent over Eurasia feature strong wintertime upward-propagating planetary wave pulses, a weaker wintertime polar vortex, and high geopotential heights in the wintertime polar troposphere.

   abstract = {Internal variability in the climate system gives rise to large uncertainty in projections of future climate. The uncertainty in future climate due to internal climate variability can be estimated from large ensembles of climate change simulations in which the experiment setup is the same from one ensemble member to the next but for small perturbations in the initial atmospheric state. However, large ensembles are invariably computationally expensive and susceptible to model bias.Here the authors outline an alternative approach for assessing the role of internal variability in future climate based on a simple analytic model and the statistics of the unforced climate variability. The analytic model is derived from the standard error of the regression and assumes that the statistics of the internal variability are roughly Gaussian and stationary in time. When applied to the statistics of an unforced control simulation, the analytic model provides a remarkably robust estimate of the uncertainty in fut...},

The CMIP5 models are also used to detect anthropogenic components of the observed trends, by assessing alternative hypotheses based on scenarios driven with either anthropogenic plus natural forcings combined, or with natural forcings only. Modeled variability is assessed via inspection of control run time series, standard deviation maps, spectral analyses, and low-frequency variance consistency tests.

   abstract = {This paper addresses the specter of a September ice-free Arctic in the 21st century using newly available simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). We find that large spread in the projected timing of the September ice-free Arctic in 30 CMIP5 models is associated at least as much with different atmospheric model components as with initial conditions. Here we reduce the spread in the timing of an ice-free state using two different approaches for the 30 CMIP5 models: (i) model selection based on the ability to reproduce the observed sea ice climatology and variability since 1979 and (ii) constrained estimation based on the strong and persistent relationship between present and future sea ice conditions. Results from the two approaches show good agreement. Under a high-emission scenario both approaches project that September ice extent will drop to ∼1.7 million km(2) in the mid 2040s and reach the ice-free state (defined as 1 million km(2)) in 2054-2058. Under a medium-mitigation scenario, both approaches project a decrease to ∼1.7 million km(2) in the early 2060s, followed by a leveling off in the ice extent.},

   abstract = {Seasonal transitions from winter to spring impact a wide variety of ecological and physical systems. While the effects of early springs across North America are widely documented, changes in their frequency and likelihood under the combined influences of climate change and natural variability are poorly understood. Extremely early springs, such as March 2012, can lead to severe economical losses and agricultural damage when these are followed by hard freeze events. Here we use the new Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble project and Extended Spring Indices to simulate historical and future spring onsets across the United States and in the particular the Great Lakes region. We found a marked increase in the frequency of March 2012-like springs by midcentury in addition to an overall trend towards earlier spring onsets, which nearly doubles that of observational records. However, changes in the date of last freeze do not occur at the same rate, therefore, causing a potential increase in the threat of plant tissue damage. Although large-scale climate modes, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, have previously dominated decadal to multidecadal spring onset trends, our results indicate a decreased role in natural climate variability and hence a greater forced response by the end of the century for modulating trends. Without a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, our study suggests that years like 2012 in the US could become normal by mid-century.},

These variables play important roles in the distribution and annual balance of sea ice volume within the basin. While it is not expected that uninitialized simulations agree completely with observations, these assessments serve to summarize ensemble behavior, as baselines for measuring improvements, and to evaluate reliability of CMIP3 simulations (and potentially CMIP5) for projection of decline rates of Arctic sea ice coverage. We find the model‐data differences and intermodel scatter in summarizing statistics are large. In a majority of model fields the mean high‐pressure pattern in the southern Beaufort is significantly displaced toward the central Arctic Basin, leading to difficulties in reproducing the mean spatial patterns of sea ice circulation, thickness, and ice export. Thus, even though the CMIP3 multimodel data set agrees that increased greenhouse gas concentrations will result in reductions of Arctic sea ice area and volume, these comparisons suggest considerable uncertainties in the projected rates of sea ice decline.},

There were 31 stations, with lifetimes of 1–7 yr. Analyses are performed here for the 37 years 1954–91, during which time at least one station was always reporting. Snow depth at the stakes was sometimes higher than on the lines, and sometimes lower, but no systematic trend of snow depth was detected as a function of distance from the station along the 1000-m lines that would indicate an influence of the station. To determine the seasonal progression of snow depth for each year at each station, priority was given to snow lines if available; otherwise the fixed stakes were used, with an offset applied if necessary.

A one-dimensional experiment is conducted to evaluate the skill of the nudging method. The mixed layer model (MLM) used in the experiment is a second-order turbulence closure model that has a strong nonlinearity. The skill of the nudging method is compared with that of an ensemble Kalman filter, which is a statistically optimal method for nonlinear dynamic models.

   abstract = {Arctic summer sea ice extent exhibits substantial interannual variability, as is highlighted by the remarkable recovery in sea ice extent in 2013 following the record minimum in the summer of 2012. Here, we explore the mechanism via which Arctic Oscillation (AO)-induced ice thickness changes impact summer sea ice, using observations and reanalysis data. A positive AO weakens the basin-scale anticyclonic sea ice drift and decreases the winter ice thickness by 15cm and 10cm in the Eurasian and the Pacific sectors of the Arctic respectively. Three reanalysis datasets show that the upward surface heat fluxes are reduced over wide areas of the Arctic, suppressing the ice growth during the positive AO winters. The winter dynamic and thermodynamic thinning preconditions the ice for enhanced radiative forcing via the ice-albedo feedback in late spring–summer, leading to an additional 10 cm of thinning over the Pacific sector of the Arctic. Because of these winter AO-induced dynamic and thermodynamics effe...},

   abstract = {A suite of historical atmospheric model simulations is described that uses a hierarchy of global boundary forcings designed to inform research on the detection and attribution of weather and climate-related extremes. In addition to experiments forced by actual variations in sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, and atmospheric chemical composition (so-called Factual experiments); additional (Counterfactual) experiments are conducted in which the boundary forcings are adjusted by removing estimates of long-term climate change. A third suite of experiments are identical to the Factual runs except that sea ice concentrations are set to climatological conditions (Clim-Polar experiments). These were used to investigate the cause for extremely warm Arctic surface temperature during 2016. Much of the magnitude of surface temperature anomalies averaged poleward of 65°N in 2016 (3.2 ± 0.6 °C above a 1980–89 reference) is shown to have been forced by observed global boundary conditions. The Factual experiments reveal that at least three quarters of the magnitude of 2016 annual mean Arctic warmth was forced, with considerable sensitivity to assumptions of sea ice thickness change. Results also indicate that 30–40% of the overall forced Arctic warming signal in 2016 originated from drivers outside of the Arctic. Despite such remote effects, the experiments reveal that the extreme magnitude of the 2016 Arctic warmth could not have occurred without consideration of the Arctic sea ice loss. We find a near-zero probability for Arctic surface temperature to be as warm as occurred in 2016 under late-19th century boundary conditions, and also under 2016 boundary conditions that do not include the depleted Arctic sea ice. Results from the atmospheric model experiments are reconciled with coupled climate model simulations which lead to a conclusion that about 60% of the 2016 Arctic warmth was likely attributable to human-induced climate change.},

For the nonorographic wave sources, a frontal system and convective GW source parameterization are used. These parameterizations link GW generation to tropospheric quantities calculated by the GCM and provide a model-consistent GW representation. With the new GW source parameterization, a reasonable middle atmospheric circulation can be obtained and the middle atmospheric circulation is better in several respects than that generated by a typical GW source specification.

The remote influence of Siberian snow anomalies is found to be weak in the models, especially in the stratosphere where the “Holton–Tan” effect of the QBO dominates the simulated snow influence on the polar vortex. At the surface, discrepancies between composite analyses from observations and model results question the causal relationship between snow and the atmospheric circulation, suggesting that the atmosphere might have driven snow anomalies rather than the other way around. When both forcings are combined, the simulations suggest destructive interference between the response to positive snow anomalies and easterly QBO (and vice versa), at odds with the hypothesis that the s...},

   abstract = {The decline of Arctic sea ice is an integral part of anthropogenic climate change. Sea-ice loss is already having a significant impact on Arctic communities and ecosystems. Its role as a cause of climate changes outside of the Arctic has also attracted much scientific interest. Evidence is mounting that Arctic sea-ice loss can affect weather and climate throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The remote impacts of Arctic sea-ice loss can only be properly represented using models that simulate interactions among the ocean, sea ice, land and atmosphere. A synthesis of six such experiments with different models shows consistent hemispheric-wide atmospheric warming, strongest in the mid-to-high-latitude lower troposphere; an intensification of the wintertime Aleutian Low and, in most cases, the Siberian High; a weakening of the Icelandic Low; and a reduction in strength and southward shift of the mid-latitude westerly winds in winter. The atmospheric circulation response seems to be sensitive to the magnitude and geographic pattern of sea-ice loss and, in some cases, to the background climate state. However, it is unclear whether current-generation climate models respond too weakly to sea-ice change. We advocate for coordinated experiments that use different models and observational constraints to quantify the climate response to Arctic sea-ice loss.},

At present, summer sea ice variability and change dominate in the perennial ice covered Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, and Kara seas, with the East Siberian Sea explaining the largest fraction of September ice loss (22%). Winter variability and change occur in the seasonally ice covered seas further south; the Barents Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, Greenland Sea, and Baffin Bay, with the Barents Sea carrying the largest fraction of loss in March (27%). The distinct regions of summer and winter sea ice variability and loss have generally been consistent si...},

The response to projected sea ice thickness loss indicates substantial surface warming over the Arctic Ocean and up to 1° C of cooling in Eurasia. While the dynamic circulation response from sea ice thickness loss is smaller in magnitude, it has a similar spatial anomaly pattern as that due to sea ice concentration loss. This pattern resembles the negative phase of the Northern Annular Mode. The simulations reveal that sea ice thickness loss enhances the thermodynamic and large‐scale circulation response from sea ice anomalies.

Yet large year-to-year fluctuations are also present in the September SIE and the mechanisms for this variability are still not clear. Here we address this issue by examining the preconditions in meteorological fields in the previous spring and summer from observations and a large ensemble of historical climate model simulations. The focus of this study is on the impact of anomalous moisture transport into the Arctic and the associated surface energy fluxes on the September SIE. We find that the below-normal September SIE is associated with enhanced moisture transport into the Arctic in spring, which induces downward thermal radiation at the surface. However, in summer, the anomalous moisture transport over the Arctic is divergent due to an anticyclonic atmospheric flow pattern and the ice albedo feedback plays a leading role in sea ice loss.},

Analyzing 50 winters using NCEP/NCAR (National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research) reanalysis data we derive probability density functions (PDFs) of positive vertical wave number as a function of zonal and meridional wave numbers. We contrast this quantity with classical climatological means of the vertical wave number. Introducing a membership value function (MVF) based on fuzzy logic, we objectively generate a modified set of PDFs (mPDFs) and demonstrate their superior performance compared to the climatological mean of vertical wave number and the original PDFs. We argue that mPDFs allow an even better understanding of how background conditions impact wave propagation in a climatological sense. As expected, probabilities are decreasing with increasing zonal wave numbers. In addition we discuss the meridional wave number dependency of the PDFs which is usually neglected, highlighting the contribution of meridional wave numbers 2 and 3 in the stratosphere. We also describe how mPDFs change in response to strong vortex regime (SVR) and weak vortex regime (WVR) conditions, with increased probabilities of the wave propagation during WVR than SVR in the stratosphere. We conclude that the mPDFs are a convenient way to summarize climatological information about planetary wave propagation in reanalysis and climate model data.</p>},

Among other factors, wintertime atmospheric circulation has been shown to be predictive of summertime Arctic sea ice extent. Specifically, many studies have shown that the interannual variability of summertime Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) is anti-correlated with the leading mode of extratropical atmospheric variability, the Arctic Oscillation (AO), in the preceding winter. Given this relationship, the potential predictive role of stratospheric circulation extremes and stratosphere-troposphere coupling in linking the AO and Arctic SIE variability is examined. It is shown that extremes in the stratospheric circulation during the winter season, namely stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) and strong polar vortex (SPV) events, are associated with significant anomalies in sea ice concentration in the Barents Sea in spring and along the...},

To accomplish this a new, objective identification algorithm is developed. This algorithm identifies sudden warmings based on the zonal mean zonal wind at 60°N and 10 hPa, and classifies them into events that do and do not split the stratospheric polar vortex. Major midwinter stratospheric sudden warmings are found to occur with a frequency of approximately six events per decade, and 46% of warming events lead to a splitting of the stratospheric polar vortex.

   abstract = {Previous studies have extensively investigated the impact of Arctic sea ice anomalies on the midlatitude circulation and associated surface climate in winter. However, there is an ongoing scientific debate regarding whether and how sea ice retreat results in the observed cold anomaly over the adjacent continents. We present a robust “cold Siberia” pattern in the winter following sea ice loss over the Barents-Kara seas in late autumn in an advanced atmospheric general circulation model, with a well-resolved stratosphere. Additional targeted experiments reveal that the stratospheric response to sea ice forcing is crucial in the development of cold conditions over Siberia, indicating the dominant role of the stratospheric pathway compared with the direct response within the troposphere. In particular, the downward influence of the stratospheric circulation anomaly significantly intensifies the ridge near the Ural Mountains and the trough over East Asia. The persistently intensified ridge and trough favor more frequent cold air outbreaks and colder winters over Siberia. This finding has important implications for improving seasonal climate prediction of midlatitude cold events. The results also suggest that the model performance in representing the stratosphere-troposphere coupling could be an important source of the discrepancy between recent studies.},

Correlation with the tropics was strongest when 40-mb equatorial winds were used to define the tropical QBO. Easterly phase at 40 mb implied a weaker than normal polar night jet and warmer than normal polar temperature and vice versa. An opposite relationship was obtained using 10-mb equatorial winds.

Despite climate modelling advances, models remain challenged to reproduce the proposed sequence of processes by which snow cover can influence the atmosphere, calling into question the robustness of this coupling. Here, we summarize the current level of understanding of snow–atmosphere coupling, and the implications of this interaction under future climate change. Projected patterns of snow-cover variability and altered stratospheric conditions suggest a need for new model experiments to isolate the effect of projected changes in snow on the atmosphere.},

   abstract = {<p>Persistent episodes of extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere summer have been associated with high-amplitude quasi-stationary atmospheric Rossby waves, with zonal wave numbers 6 to 8 resulting from the phenomenon of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA). A fingerprint for the occurrence of QRA can be defined in terms of the zonally averaged surface temperature field. Examining state-of-the-art [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)] climate model projections, we find that QRA events are likely to increase by ~50% this century under business-as-usual carbon emissions, but there is considerable variation among climate models. Some predict a near tripling of QRA events by the end of the century, while others predict a potential decrease. Models with amplified Arctic warming yield the most pronounced increase in QRA events. The projections are strongly dependent on assumptions regarding the nature of changes in radiative forcing associated with anthropogenic aerosols over the next century. One implication of our findings is that a reduction in midlatitude aerosol loading could actually lead to Arctic de-amplification this century, ameliorating potential increases in persistent extreme weather events.</p>},

To understand better the atmospheric changes that may have occurred in response to Arctic sea ice loss, this study presents results from atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments in which the only time-varying forcings prescribed were observed variations in Arctic sea ice and accompanying changes in Arctic sea surface temperatures from 1979 to 2009. Two independent AGCMs are utilized in order to assess the robustness of the response across different models. The results suggest that the atmospheric impacts of Arctic sea ice loss have been manifested most strongly within the maritime and coastal Arctic and in the lowermost atmosphere. Sea ice loss has driven increased energy transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere, enhanced warming and moistening of the lower troposphere, decreased the strength of the surface temperature inversion, and increased lower-tropospheric thickness; all of these chan...},

   abstract = {The ongoing loss of Arctic sea-ice cover has implications for the wider climate system. The detection and importance of the atmospheric impacts of sea-ice loss depends, in part, on the relative magnitudes of the sea-ice forced change compared to natural atmospheric internal variability (AIV). This study analyses large ensembles of two independent atmospheric general circulation models in order to separate the forced response to historical Arctic sea-ice loss (1979–2009) from AIV, and to quantify signal-to-noise ratios. We also present results from a simulation with the sea-ice forcing roughly doubled in magnitude. In proximity to regions of sea-ice loss, we identify statistically significant near-surface atmospheric warming and precipitation increases, in autumn and winter in both models. In winter, both models exhibit a significant lowering of sea level pressure and geopotential height over the Arctic. All of these responses are broadly similar, but strengthened and/or more geographically extensive, when the sea-ice forcing is doubled in magnitude. Signal-to-noise ratios differ considerably between variables and locations. The temperature and precipitation responses are significantly easier to detect (higher signal-to-noise ratio) than the sea level pressure or geopotential height responses. Equally, the local response (i.e., in the vicinity of sea-ice loss) is easier to detect than the mid-latitude or upper-level responses. Based on our estimates of signal-to-noise, we conjecture that the local near-surface temperature and precipitation responses to past Arctic sea-ice loss exceed AIV and are detectable in observed records, but that the potential atmospheric circulation, upper-level and remote responses may be partially or wholly masked by AIV.},

   abstract = {The surface temperature response to greenhouse gas forcing displays a characteristic pattern of polar-amplified warming1–5, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. However, the causes of this polar amplification are still debated. Some studies highlight the importance of surface-albedo feedback6–8, while others find larger contributions from longwave feedbacks4,9,10, with changes in atmospheric and oceanic heat transport also thought to play a role11–16. Here, we determine the causes of polar amplification using climate model simulations in which CO2 forcing is prescribed in distinct geographical regions, with the linear sum of climate responses to regional forcings replicating the response to global forcing. The degree of polar amplification depends strongly on the location of CO2 forcing. In particular, polar amplification is found to be dominated by forcing in the polar regions, specifically through positive local lapse-rate feedback, with ice-albedo and Planck feedbacks playing subsidiary roles. Extra-polar forcing is further shown to be conducive to polar warming, but given that it induces a largely uniform warming pattern through enhanced poleward heat transport, it contributes little to polar amplification. Therefore, understanding polar amplification requires primarily a better insight into local forcing and feedbacks rather than extra-polar processes.},

This is illustrated by application to a simple theoretical model of a forced Rossby wave train and to a Northern Hemisphere winter climatology. Results of the latter procedure suggest that the major forcing of the stationary wave field derives from the orographic effects of the Tibetan plateau and from nonorographic effects (diabatic heating and/or interaction with transient eddies) in the western North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans and Siberia. No evidence is found in the data for wave trains of tropical origin; forcing by the orographic effects of the Rocky mountains seems to be of secondary importance.},

   abstract = {One of the outstanding questions regarding the observed relationship between October Eurasian snow cover anomalies and the boreal winter northern annular mode (NAM) is what causes the multiple-week lag between positive Eurasian snow cover anomalies in October and the associated peak in Rossby wave activity flux from the troposphere to the stratosphere in December. This study explores the following hypothesis about this lag: in order to achieve amplification of the wave activity, the vertically propagating Rossby wave train associated with the snow cover anomaly must reinforce the climatological stationary wave, which corresponds to constructive linear interference between the anomalous wave and the climatological wave. It is shown that the lag in peak wave activity flux arises because the Rossby wave train associated with the snow cover is in quadrature or out of phase with the climatological stationary wave from October to mid-November. Beginning in mid-November the associated wave anomaly migrates into a position that is in phase with the climatological wave, leading to constructive interference and anomalously positive upward wave activity fluxes until mid-January. Climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) do not capture this behavior. This linear interference effect is not only associated with stratospheric variability related to Eurasian snow cover anomalies but is a general feature of Northern Hemisphere troposphere–stratosphere interactions and, in particular, dominated the negative NAM events of the fall–winter of 2009/10.},

Time-slice model runs with historic sea ice concentrations are compared to runs with future concentrations, from the late twenty-first century, in each hemisphere separately. As for the Arctic, results indicate that Antarctic sea ice loss will act to shift the tropospheric jet equatorward, an internal negative feedback to the poleward shift associated with increased greenhouse gases. Also, the tropospheric response to Antarctic sea ice loss is found to be somewhat weaker, more vertically confined, and less seasonally varying than in the case of Arctic sea ice loss.

The composite difference of the atmospheric state between QBO-E and QBO-W is found to closely resemble the structure of the northern annular mode, the leading empirical orthogonal function of stratospheric variability, including its wave components. Studies of dynamical systems indicate that many different forcings could give rise to this response, and therefore this composite difference does not provide much information about the forcing mechanism. It is argued that the full transient response of a system to an applied forcing is likely to be much more informative about the dynamics of the forcing mechanism, especially the response on time scales shorter than the dynamical time scale, which is about a week for vortex variability.

   abstract = {In sharp contrast to the decreasing sea ice coverage of the Arctic, in the Antarctic the sea ice cover has, on average, expanded since the late 1970s. More specifically, satellite passive-microwave data for the period November 1978–December 2010 reveal an overall positive trend in ice extents of 17 100 &plusmn; 2300 km2 yr−1. Much of the increase, at 13 700 &plusmn; 1500 km2 yr−1, has occurred in the region of the Ross Sea, with lesser contributions from the Weddell Sea and Indian Ocean. One region, that of the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas, has (like the Arctic) instead experienced significant sea ice decreases, with an overall ice extent trend of −8200 &plusmn; 1200 km2 yr−1. When examined through the annual cycle over the 32-yr period 1979–2010, the Southern Hemisphere sea ice cover as a whole experienced positive ice extent trends in every month, ranging in magnitude from a low of 9100 &plusmn; 6300 km2 yr−1 in February to a high of 24 700 &plusmn; 10 000 km2 yr−1 in May. The Ross Sea and Indian Ocean also had positive trends in each month, while the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas had negative trends in each month, and the Weddell Sea and western Pacific Ocean had a mixture of positive and negative trends. Comparing ice-area results to ice-extent results, in each case the ice-area trend has the same sign as the ice-extent trend, but the magnitudes of the two trends differ, and in some cases these differences allow inferences about the corresponding changes in sea ice concentrations. The strong pattern of decreasing ice coverage in the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas region and increasing ice coverage in the Ross Sea region is suggestive of changes in atmospheric circulation. This is a key topic for future research.},

This disproportionate warming—known as Arctic amplification—has caused significant local changes to the Arctic system and more uncertain remote changes across the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Here, an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) is used to test the sensitivity of the atmospheric and surface response to Arctic sea ice loss to the phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), which varies on (multi-) decadal time scales. Four experiments are performed, combining low and high sea ice states with global sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies associated with opposite phases of the AMO. A trough–ridge–trough response to wintertime sea ice loss is seen in the Pacific–North American sector in the negative phase of the AMO.

   abstract = {Northern midlatitudes, over central Eurasia in particular, have experienced frequent severe winters in recent decades1–3. A remote influence of Arctic sea-ice loss has been suggested4–14; however, the importance of this connection remains controversial because of discrepancies among modelling and between modelling and observational studies15–17. Here, using a hybrid analysis of observations and multi-model large ensembles from seven atmospheric general circulation models, we examine the cause of these differences. While all models capture the observed structure of the forced surface temperature response to sea-ice loss in the Barents–Kara Seas—including Eurasian cooling—we show that its magnitude is systematically underestimated. Owing to the varying degrees of this underestimation of sea-ice-forced signal, the signal-to-noise ratio differs markedly. Correcting this underestimation reconciles the discrepancy between models and observations, leading to the conclusion that ~44% of the central Eurasian cooling trend for 1995–2014 is attributable to sea-ice loss in the Barents–Kara Seas. Our results strongly suggest that anthropogenic forcing has significantly amplified the probability of severe winter occurrence in central Eurasia via enhanced melting of the Barents–Kara sea ice. The difference in underestimation of signal-to-noise ratio between models therefore calls for careful experimental design and interpretation for regional climate change attribution.},

   abstract = {<p><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> The diminishing Arctic sea ice pack has been widely studied, but previous research has mostly focused on time-mean changes in sea ice rather than on short-term variations that also have important physical and societal consequences. In this study we test the hypothesis that future interannual Arctic sea ice area variability will increase by utilizing 40 independent simulations from the Community Earth System Model's Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) for the 1920–2100 period and augment this with simulations from 12 models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Both CESM-LE and CMIP5 models project that ice area variability will indeed grow substantially but not monotonically in every month. There is also a strong seasonal dependence in the magnitude and timing of future variability increases that is robust among CESM ensemble members. The variability generally correlates with the average ice retreat rate, before there is an eventual disappearance in both terms as the ice pack becomes seasonal in summer and autumn by late century. The peak in variability correlates best with the total area of ice between 0.2 and 0.6<span class="thinspace"></span>m monthly thickness, indicating that substantial future thinning of the ice pack is required before variability maximizes. Within this range, the most favorable thickness for high areal variability depends on the season, especially whether ice growth or ice retreat processes dominate. Our findings suggest that thermodynamic melting (top, bottom, lateral) and growth (frazil, congelation) processes are more important than dynamical mechanisms, namely ice export and ridging, in controlling ice area variability.</p>]]></p>},

It is shown that changes in August/September sea ice concentration impact on tropospheric and stratospheric geopotential heights in the following winter. During low ice phases a negative tropospheric Arctic Oscillation pattern is found, which is connected to a weakened stratospheric polar vortex and warmer stratospheric temperatures. Furthermore, the analysis reveals enhanced upward EP fluxes due to planetary waves for low ice conditions. Strong stratospheric anomalies in the Atlantic/European region are associated with a weaker polar vortex. Low ice periods are connected with additional tropospheric wave energy excitation in the Pacific/North America region and influence the stratosphere through three-dimensional planetary wave propagation.},

The theory makes it possible to discuss the latitudinal (y) and vertical (z) dependence of ∂ū/∂t qualitatively and calculate it directly from an approximate knowledge of the wave structure.

Autocorrelation analysis demonstrated that it was an important mode of interannual variability in the extratropical winter stratosphere. Correlation with the tropics was strongest when 40-mb equatorial winds were used to define the tropical QBO. Easterly phase at 40 mb implied a weaker than normal polar night jet and warmer than normal polar temperature and vice versa. An opposite relationship was obtained using 10-mb equatorial winds.

A wave geometry diagnostic for wave propagation characteristics that separates the index of refraction into vertical and meridional components is used to diagnose the occurrence of reflecting surfaces. For zonal wavenumber 1, this study suggests that there is one characteristic configuration of the stratospheric jet that reflects waves back into the troposphere—when the polar night jet peaks in the high-latitude midstratosphere.

   abstract = {The dynamical mechanisms through which stratospheric forcing can influence tropospheric annular modes are explored. A torque is applied to the stratosphere of an idealized general circulation model, and, under some circumstances, a robust tropospheric response is observed. These tropospheric responses, while initiated by stratospheric forcing, are maintained locally by interactions with transient eddies, and they closely resemble the intrinsic annular modes of the model. Manipulations of the model are consistent in showing that planetary waves, and not only the zonally symmetric secondary circulations induced by stratospheric forcing, are important for transmitting dynamical signals to the troposphere. Specifically, it is found that the tropospheric response is significantly reduced when planetary waves are suppressed in the stratosphere by additional damping or when the strength of the stratospheric jet is increased. Wave diagnoses indicate that the confinement of these waves within the troposph...},

In this paper, attention is drawn away from the stratosphere to demonstrate that the originating point of ESEs is located in the troposphere. First, it is shown that anomalously strong eddy heat fluxes at 100 hPa nearly always precede weak vortex events, and conversely, anomalously weak eddy heat fluxes precede strong vortex events, consistent with wave–mean flow interaction theory. This finding clarifies the dynamical nature of ESEs and suggests that a major source of stratospheric variability (and thus predictability) is located in the troposphere below and not in the stratosphere itself. Second, it is shown that the daily time series of eddy heat flux found at 100 hPa and integrated over the prior 40 days, exhibit a remarkably high anticorrelation (−0.8)...},

Here, the dynamics of this teleconnection are investigated using a 100-member ensemble of transient integrations of the GFDL atmospheric general circulation model (AM2). The model is perturbed with a simple persisted snow anomaly over Siberia and is integrated from October through December. Strong surface cooling occurs above the anomalous Siberian snow cover, which produces a tropospheric form stress anomaly associated with the vertical propagation of wave activity. This wave activity response drives wave–mean flow interaction in the lower stratosphere and subsequent downward propagation of a negative-phase northern annular mode response back into the troposphere. A wintertime coupled stratosphere–troposphere response to fall season snow forcing is also found to occur even when the snow forcing itself does not persist into...},

A pattern scaling approach is proposed in which the local multidecadal mean atmospheric response is assumed to be separately proportional to the total sea ice loss and to the total low-latitude ocean surface warming. The proposed approach estimates the response to Arctic sea ice loss with low-latitude ocean temperatures fixed and vice versa. The sea ice response includes a high northern latitude easterly zonal wind response, an equatorward shift of the eddy-driven jet, a weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex, an anticyclonic sea level pressure anomaly over coastal Eurasia, a cyclonic sea level pressure anomaly over the North Pacific, and increased wintertime precipitation over the west coast of North America.

The results highlight the contrasting spatial structures and partially compensating effects of thermodynamic and dynamic coupling. In combination, thermodynamic and dynamic coupling produce a response pattern that is largely symmetric about the equator, whereas thermodynamic coupling alone yields an antisymmetric response. The latter is characterized by an interhemispheric sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, with maximum warming at high northern latitudes decreasing toward the equator, which displaces the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and Hadley circulation northward.

This study explores the following hypothesis about this lag: in order to achieve amplification of the wave activity, the vertically propagating Rossby wave train associated with the snow cover anomaly must reinforce the climatological stationary wave, which corresponds to constructive linear interference between the anomalous wave and the climatological wave. It is shown that the lag in peak wave activity flux arises because the Rossby wave train associated with the snow cover is in quadrature or out of phase with the climatological stationary wave from October to mid-November.

   abstract = {Polar amplification – the phenomenon where external radiative forcing produces a larger change in surface temperature at high latitudes than the global average – is a key aspect of anthropogenic climate change, but its causes and consequences are not fully understood. The Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP) contribution to the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6; Eyring et al., 2016) seeks to improve our understanding of this phenomenon through a coordinated set of numerical model experiments documented here. In particular, PAMIP will address the following primary questions: (1) what are the relative roles of local sea ice and remote sea surface temperature changes in driving polar amplification? (2) How does the global climate system respond to changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice? These issues will be addressed with multi-model simulations that are forced with different combinations of sea ice and/or sea surface temperatures representing present-day, pre-industrial and future conditions. The use of three time periods allows the signals of interest to be diagnosed in multiple ways. Lower-priority tier experiments are proposed to investigate additional aspects and provide further understanding of the physical processes. These experiments will address the following specific questions: what role does ocean–atmosphere coupling play in the response to sea ice? How and why does the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice depend on the pattern of sea ice forcing? How and why does the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice depend on the model background state? What have been the roles of local sea ice and remote sea surface temperature in polar amplification, and the response to sea ice, over the recent period since 1979? How does the response to sea ice evolve on decadal and longer timescales? A key goal of PAMIP is to determine the real-world situation using imperfect climate models. Although the experiments proposed here form a coordinated set, we anticipate a large spread across models. However, this spread will be exploited by seeking “emergent constraints” in which model uncertainty may be reduced by using an observable quantity that physically explains the intermodel spread. In summary, PAMIP will improve our understanding of the physical processes that drive polar amplification and its global climate impacts, thereby reducing the uncertainties in future projections and predictions of climate change and variability. ]]>},

   abstract = {Recent observational and modeling studies have demonstrated a link between eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (TPO) warming associated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the negative phase of the wintertime northern annular mode (NAM). The TPO–NAM link involves a Rossby wave teleconnection from the tropics to the extratropics, and an increase in polar stratospheric wave driving that in turn induces a negative NAM anomaly in the stratosphere and troposphere. Previous work further suggests that tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) warming is associated with a positive NAM anomaly, which is of opposite sign to the TPO case. The TIO case is, however, difficult to interpret because the TPO and TIO warmings are not independent. To better understand the dynamics of tropical influences on the NAM, the current study investigates the NAM response to imposed TPO and TIO warmings in a general circulation model.

   abstract = {In North America and Asia, extreme cold weather characterized the winter of 2017–18. At the same time, the Pacific, the Bering Sea, and the Atlantic Arctic regions experienced anomalously low sea ice extent in the early winter. The jet stream dividing cold Arctic air from warm air deviated from normal zonal patterns northward into the ice-free areas north of the Bering Strait. Large southward jet stream pathways formed over Asia and America, allowing cold air to spread into Asia and the southern areas of North America. We hypothesise that the late autumn Bering Strait sea-ice anomaly and Pacific atmospheric rivers were partially responsible for the cold winter. We used data analyses and numerical experiments to test this hypothesis. We propose a positive feedback mechanism between the sea ice anomaly and atmospheric river activity, with anomalous south winds toward the sea ice anomaly potentially leading to more warm water injected by the wind-driven current through the Bering Strait. Our findings suggest that Poleward propagation of the atmospheric rivers made upper air warm, leading to their upgliding, which further heated the overlying air, causing poleward jet meanders. As a part of this response the jet stream meandered southward over Asia and North America, resulting in cold intrusions. We speculate that the positive feedback mechanism observed during the 2017–18 winter could recur in future years when the sea-ice reduction in the Pacific Arctic interacts with enhanced atmospheric river activity.},

   abstract = {Arctic warming was more pronounced than warming in midlatitudes in the last decades making this region a hotspot of climate change. Associated with this, a rapid decline of sea-ice extent and a decrease of its thickness has been observed. Sea-ice retreat allows for an increased transport of heat and momentum from the ocean up to the tropo- and stratosphere by enhanced upward propagation of planetary-scale atmospheric waves. In the upper atmosphere, these waves deposit the momentum transported, disturbing the stratospheric polar vortex, which can lead to a breakdown of this circulation with the potential to also significantly impact the troposphere in mid- to late-winter and early spring. Therefore, an accurate representation of stratospheric processes in climate models is necessary to improve the understanding of the impact of retreating sea ice on the atmospheric circulation. By modeling the atmospheric response to a prescribed decline in Arctic sea ice, we show that including interactive stratospheric ozone chemistry in atmospheric model calculations leads to an improvement in tropo-stratospheric interactions compared to simulations without interactive chemistry. This suggests that stratospheric ozone chemistry is important for the understanding of sea ice related impacts on atmospheric dynamics.},

   abstract = {Recent modeling studies have shown an important role for stratosphere-troposphere coupling in the large-scale atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss. Evidence is growing that the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO) can contribute to or even mitigate teleconnections from surface forcing. Here, the influence of QBO phase on the atmospheric response to projected Arctic sea ice loss is examined using an atmospheric general circulation model with a well-resolved stratosphere and a QBO prescribed from observations. The role of the QBO is determined by compositing seasons with easterly phase (QBO-E) separately from seasons with westerly phase (QBO-W). In response to the sea ice forcing in early winter, the polar vortex during QBO-E weakens with strong stratosphere-troposphere wave-1 coupling and a negative Northern Annular Mode-type response. At the surface, this results in more severe Siberian cold spells. For QBO-W, the polar vortex strengthens in response to the sea ice forcing},

@article{Scaife2018,
   abstract = {We review the growing evidence for a widespread inconsistency between the low strength of predictable signals in climate models and the relatively high level of agreement they exhibit with observed variability of the atmospheric circulation. This discrepancy is particularly evident in the climate variability of the Atlantic sector, where ensemble predictions using climate models generally show higher correlation with observed variability than with their own simulations, and higher correlations with observations than would be expected from their small signal-to-noise ratios, hence a ‘signal-to-noise paradox’. This unusual behaviour has been documented in multiple climate prediction systems and in the response to a number of different sources of climate variability. However, we also note that the total variance in the models is often close in magnitude to the observed variance, and so it is not a simple matter of models containing too much variability. Instead, the proportion of Atlantic climate variance that is predictable in climate models appears to be too weak in amplitude by a factor of two, or perhaps more. In this review, we provide a range of examples from existing studies to build the case for a problem that is common across different climate models, common to several different sources of climate variability and common across a range of timescales. We also discuss the wider implications of this intriguing paradox.},

   abstract = {Earth’s equator-to-pole temperature gradient drives westerly mid-latitude jet streams through thermal wind balance1. In the upper atmosphere, anthropogenic climate change is strengthening this meridional temperature gradient by cooling the polar lower stratosphere2,3 and warming the tropical upper troposphere4–6, acting to strengthen the upper-level jet stream7. In contrast, in the lower atmosphere, Arctic amplification of global warming is weakening the meridional temperature gradient8–10, acting to weaken the upper-level jet stream. Therefore, trends in the speed of the upper-level jet stream11–13 represent a closely balanced tug-of-war between two competing effects at different altitudes14. It is possible to isolate one of the competing effects by analysing the vertical shear—the change in wind speed with height—instead of the wind speed, but this approach has not previously been taken. Here we show that, although the zonal wind speed in the North Atlantic polar jet stream at 250 hectopascals has not changed since the start of the observational satellite era in 1979, the vertical shear has increased by 15 per cent (with a range of 11–17 per cent) according to three different reanalysis datasets15–17. We further show that this trend is attributable to the thermal wind response to the enhanced upper-level meridional temperature gradient. Our results indicate that climate change may be having a larger impact on the North Atlantic jet stream than previously thought. The increased vertical shear is consistent with the intensification of shear-driven clear-air turbulence expected from climate change18–20, which will affect aviation in the busy transatlantic flight corridor by creating a more turbulent flying environment for aircraft. We conclude that the effects of climate change and variability on the upper-level jet stream are being partly obscured by the traditional focus on wind speed rather than wind shear.},

   abstract = {Observations show that reduced regional sea-ice cover is coincident with cold mid-latitude winters on interannual timescales. However, it remains unclear whether these observed links are causal, and model experiments suggest that they might not be. Here we apply two independent approaches to infer causality from observations and climate models and to reconcile these sources of data. Models capture the observed correlations between reduced sea ice and cold mid-latitude winters, but only when reduced sea ice coincides with anomalous heat transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean, implying that the atmosphere is driving the loss. Causal inference from the physics-based approach is corroborated by a lead–lag analysis, showing that circulation-driven temperature anomalies precede, but do not follow, reduced sea ice. Furthermore, no mid-latitude cooling is found in modelling experiments with imposed future sea-ice loss. Our results show robust support for anomalous atmospheric circulation simultaneously driving cold mid-latitude winters and mild Arctic conditions, and reduced sea ice having a minimal influence on severe mid-latitude winters.},

Here we show using large ensembles of fully coupled, partially coupled and uncoupled model simulations that in northwest North America the winter cooling was primarily a remote response to climate fluctuations in the tropical Pacific.

A long persistence of extreme events often leads to societal impacts with warm-and-dry conditions severely affecting agriculture and consecutive days of heavy rainfall leading to flooding. Here we report systematic increases in the persistence of boreal summer weather in a multi-model analysis of a world 2 °C above pre-industrial compared to present-day climate. Averaged over the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude land area, the probability of warm periods lasting longer than two weeks is projected to increase by 4% (2–6% full uncertainty range) after removing seasonal-mean warming. Compound dry–warm persistence increases at a similar magnitude on average but regionally up to 20% (11–42%) in eastern North America. The probability of at least seven consecutive days of strong precipitation increases by 26% (15–37%) for the mid-latitudes. We present evidence that weakening storm track activity contributes to the projected increase in warm and dry persistence. These changes in persistence are largely avoided when warming is limited to 1.5 °C. In conjunction with the projected intensification of heat and rainfall extremes, an increase in persistence can substantially worsen the effects of future weather extremes.},

Data from multi-year sampling (i.e., 2014–2016) was renormalized to reflect 14C signatures of the 2015 calendar year. Spatial variability in Δ14C ranges from a maximum of 27.1 ± 0.4‰ (city of Petrópolis, a higher-elevation municipality) to a minimum of −43.6 ± 1.4‰ (i.e., approximately 27.6 ± 1 ppm of Cff — Santo Cristo, a district within the Rio de Janeiro city). Overall, higher Δ14C values correlate well with green habitats and high elevation areas, while lower values are associated with Cff emissions in densely populated areas with higher industrial and traffic footprints. Cff emissions are higher where local air circulation is poor, such as the area surrounding Guanabara Bay. Other areas with significantly higher Cff emissions were the Paraíba Valley and Mountain regions. These results may be explained by atmospheric transport of CO2 from neighboring states, such as São Paulo and Minas Gerais, and by the predominant west winds and the limited regional air flow created by large topographic features. Lower Cff emissions were observed in the Northwest and Lakes regions, which are dominated by agriculture and tourism activities. Our results highlight the potential of directly estimating Cff for studying urban landscapes in the southern region of Brazil through 14C time-integrated distribution mapping of ipê leaves. The method could also be used to augment greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory studies trends in partitioning Cff from CO2 of bio-template sustainable sources.},

Although there has been significant interest in the enhanced warming that is occurring at high northern latitudes, a process known as arctic amplification, remarkably little is known about these midwinter warming events at the pole including their frequency, duration and magnitude as well as the environmental conditions responsible for their occurrence. Here we use buoy and radiosonde data along with operational weather forecasts and atmospheric reanalyses to show that such events are associated with surface cyclones near the pole as well as a highly perturbed polar vortex. They occur once or twice each decade with the earliest identified event taking place in 1959. In addition, the warmest midwinter temperatures at the North Pole have been increasing at a rate that is twice as large as that for mean midwinter temperatures at the pole. It is argued that this enhanced trend is consistent with the loss of winter sea ice from the Nordic Seas that moves the reservoir of warm air over this region northwards making it easier for weather systems to transport this heat polewards.},

Temperature and humidity in the region was ~10°C (> 3σ above the 2003-14 mean) warmer and ~1.4 g kg-1 (> 4σ above the 2003-14 mean) wetter than normal during the peak of this event. This anomalous air mass resulted in a large and positive flux of energy into the surface via the residual of the surface energy balance (SEB), compared to the weakly negative SEB from the surface to the atmosphere expected for that time of year. The magnitude of the downwelling longwave radiation during the event was unprecedented compared to all other events detected by AIRS in December/January since 2003. An approximate budget scaling suggests that this anomalous SEB could have resulted in up to 10 cm of ice melt. Thinning of the ice pack in the region was supported by remotely sensed and modeled estimates of ice thickness change. Understanding the impact of this anomalous air mass on a thinner, weakened sea ice state is imperative for understanding future sea ice-atmosphere interactions in a warming Arctic.},

The period is marked by a strong synoptic pattern which produced melting temperatures in close proximity to the North Pole in late December and anomalous high pressure near the Taymyr Peninsula. Atmospheric teleconnections from the Atlantic contributed to warming over Eurasian high-latitude land surfaces, and El Niño-related teleconnections explain warming over southwestern Alaska and British Columbia, while warm anomalies over the central Arctic are associated with physical processes including the presence of enhanced atmospheric water vapor and an increased downwelling longwave radiative flux.

These measurements, which are available publicly, represent a comprehensive meteorological data set covering the seasonal transition in the Arctic Basin over the new, thinner sea ice regime. Winter was characterized by a succession of storms that produced short-lived (less than 48 h) temperature increases of 20 to 30 K at the surface. These storms were driven by the hemispheric scale circulation pattern with a large meridional component of the polar jet stream steering North Atlantic storms into the high Arctic. Nonstorm periods during winter were characterized by strong surface temperature inversions due to strong radiative cooling (“radiatively clear state”). The strength and depth of these inversions were similar to those during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) campaign. In contrast, atmospheric profiles during the “opaquely cloudy state” were different to those from SHEBA due to differences in the synoptic conditions and location within the ice pack. Storm events observed during spring/summer were the result of synoptic systems located in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Basin rather than passing directly over N-ICE2015. These synoptic systems were driven by a large-scale circulation pattern typical of recent years, with an Arctic Dipole pattern developing during June. Surface temperatures became near-constant 0°C on 1 June marking the beginning of summer. Atmospheric profiles during the spring and early summer show persistent lifted temperature and moisture inversions that are indicative of clouds and cloud processes.},

During this event, a strong intrusion of warm and moist air and an increase in downward longwave radiation, as well as a loss of sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas, were observed. Observational analyses revealed that the abrupt warming was triggered by the entry of a strong Atlantic windstorm into the Arctic in late December 2015, which brought enormous moist and warm air masses to the Arctic. Although the storm terminated at the eastern coast of Greenland in late December, it was followed by a prolonged blocking period in early 2016 that sustained the extreme Arctic warming. Numerical experiments indicate that the warming effect of sea ice loss and associated upward turbulent heat fluxes are relatively minor in this event. This result suggests the importance of the synoptically driven warm and moist air intrusion into the Arctic as a primary contributing factor of this extreme Arctic warming event.},

   abstract = {There were extensive regions of Arctic temperature extremes in January and February 2016 that continued into April. For January, the Arctic-wide averaged temperature anomaly was 2.0°C above the previous record of 3.0°C based on four reanalysis products. Midlatitude atmospheric circulation played a major role in producing such extreme temperatures. Extensive low geopotential heights at 700 hPa extended over the southeastern United States, across the Atlantic, and well into the Arctic. Low geopotential heights along the Aleutian Islands and a ridge along northwestern North America contributed southerly wind flow. These two regions of low geopotential height were seen as a major split in the tropospheric polar vortex over the Arctic. Warm air advection north of central Eurasia reinforced the ridge that split the flow near the North Pole. Winter 2015 and 2016 geopotential height fields represented an eastward shift in the longwave atmospheric circulation pattern compared to earlier in the decade (2010-13). Certainly Arctic amplification will continue, and 2016 shows that there can be major Arctic contributions from midlatitudes. Whether Arctic amplification feedbacks are accelerated by the combination of recent thinner, more mobile Arctic sea ice and occasional extreme atmospheric circulation events from midlatitudes is an interesting conjecture.},

It is found that the vertical structure of the warming associated with moist intrusions is bottom amplified, corresponding to a transition of local conditions from a "cold clear" state with a strong inversion to a "warm opaque" state with a weaker inversion. In the marginal sea ice zone of the Barents Sea, the passage of an intrusion also causes a retreat of the ice margin, which persists for many days after the intrusion has passed. The authors find that there is a positive trend in the number of intrusion events crossing 70°N during December and January that can explain roughly 45% of the surface air temperature and 30% of the sea ice concentration trends observed in the Barents Sea during the past two decades.},

   abstract = {The transport of moisture into the Arctic is tightly connected to midlatitude dynamics. We show that the bulk of the transient poleward moisture transport across 60°N is driven by extreme transport (fluxes greater than the 90th percentile) events. We demonstrate that these events are closely related to the two types of Rossby wave breaking (RWB)-anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) and cyclonic wave breaking (CWB). Using a RWB tracking algorithm, we determine that RWB can account for approximately 68% of the extreme poleward moisture transport by transients across 60°N in winter and 56% in summer. Additional analysis suggests that the seasonality of such RWB-related moisture transport is determined approximately equally by (1) the magnitude of transport (which is largely a function of the background moisture gradient) and (2) the frequency of RWB occurrence. The seasonality of RWB occurrence is, in turn, tied to the seasonal variation of the latitude of the jet streams-AWB-related (CWB-related) transport occurs more frequently when the jet is shifted poleward (equatorward). The interannual variability of RWB-related transport across 60°N in winter is shown to be strongly influenced by climate variability captured by the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In the positive (negative) phase of ENSO, AWB transports less (more) moisture through the Bering Strait and CWB transports more (less) through western Canada. In the positive (negative) phase of the NAO, AWB transports more (less) moisture through the Norwegian Sea and CWB transports less (more) along the west coast of Greenland. These results highlight that low-frequency climate variability outside of the polar regions can influence the Arctic water vapor by modulating extreme synoptic transport events.},

We note that the precise identification of the moisture sources for the Arctic depends both on the definition of the Arctic region itself and on the approach used to identify the sources, with the remote regions over the extratropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans being universally important, as are some continental areas over Siberia and North America. This review also reaffirms the absence of any clear agreement regarding the trends in atmospheric moisture transport to the Arctic, and highlights discrepancies between different data sets and approaches in the quantification of moisture transport, implying that its long-term impact on the intensification of the hydrological cycle in the Arctic remains unclear. We confirm the influence of the major modes of climate variability, planetary circulation patterns, and the changes in cyclonic activity in the variability of moisture transport to the Arctic. We reaffirm that the effect of moisture transport on the Arctic SIE through changes in humidity, cloud cover, and precipitation over the Arctic is a complex scientific problem that requires further detailed study over the decades to come, and we propose some important challenges for future research.

However, today the large government forecast centers almost exclusively rely on complex fully coupled dynamical forecast systems for their subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) predictions while statistical techniques are mostly neglected and those techniques still in use have not been updated in decades. In this Opinion Article, we argue that new statistical techniques mostly developed outside the field of climate science, collectively referred to as machine learning, can be adopted by climate forecasters to increase the accuracy of S2S predictions. We present an example of where unsupervised learning demonstrates higher accuracy in a seasonal prediction than the state-of-the-art dynamical systems. We also summarize some relevant machine learning methods that are most applicable to climate prediction. Finally, we show by comparing real-time dynamical model forecasts with observations from winter 2017/2018 that dynamical model forecasts are almost entirely insensitive to polar vortex (PV) variability and the impact on sensible weather. Instead, statistical forecasts more accurately predicted the resultant sensible weather from a mid-winter PV disruption than the dynamical forecasts. The important implication from the poor dynamical forecasts is that if Arctic change influences mid-latitude weather through PV variability, then the ability of dynamical models to demonstrate the existence of such a pathway is compromised. We conclude by suggesting that S2S prediction will be most beneficial to the public by incorporating mixed or a hybrid of dynamical forecasts and updated statistical techniques such as machine learning.

Here we explore the 2016 Arctic sea ice state in terms of its monthly sea ice cover, placing this in the context of the sea ice conditions observed since 2000. We demonstrate the sensitivity of monthly Arctic sea ice extent and area estimates, in terms of their magnitude and annual rankings, to the ice concentration input data (using two widely used datasets) and to the averaging methodology used to convert concentration to extent (daily or monthly extent calculations). We use estimates of sea ice area over sea ice extent to analyse the relative "compactness" of the Arctic sea ice cover, highlighting anomalously low compactness in the summer of 2016 which contributed to the higher-Than-expected September ice extent. Two cyclones that entered the Arctic Ocean during August appear to have driven this low-concentration/compactness ice cover but were not sufficient to cause more widespread melt-out and a new record-low September ice extent. We use concentration budgets to explore the regions and processes (thermodynamics/dynamics) contributing to the monthly 2016 extent/area estimates highlighting, amongst other things, rapid ice intensification across the central eastern Arctic through September. Two different products show significant early melt onset across the Arctic Ocean in 2016, including record-early melt onset in the North Atlantic sector of the Arctic. Our results also show record-late 2016 freeze-up in the central Arctic, North Atlantic and the Alaskan Arctic sector in particular, associated with strong sea surface temperature anomalies that appeared shortly after the 2016 minimum (October onwards). We explore the implications of this low summer ice compactness for seasonal forecasting, suggesting that sea ice area could be a more reliable metric to forecast in this more seasonal, "New Arctic", sea ice regime.},

   abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Rapid sea ice loss events (RILEs) in a mini-ensemble of regional Arctic coupled climate model scenario experiments are analyzed. Mechanisms of sudden ice loss are strongly related to atmospheric circulation conditions and preconditioning by sea ice thinning during the seasons and years before the event. Clustering of events in time suggests a strong control by large-scale atmospheric circulation. Anomalous atmospheric circulation is providing warm air anomalies of up to 5 K and is forcing ice flow, affecting winter ice growth. Even without a seasonal preconditioning during winter, ice drop events can be initiated by anomalous inflow of warm air during summer. It is shown that RILEs can be generated based on atmospheric circulation changes as a major driving force without major competing mechanisms, other than occasional longwave effects during spring and summer. Other anomalous seasonal radiative forcing or short-lived forcers (e.g., soot) play minor roles or no role at all in our model. RILEs initiated by ocean forcing do not occur in the model, although cannot be ruled out due to model limitations. Mechanisms found are qualitatively in line with observations of the 2007 RILE.</p>},

One event exhibits a decrease from 6 million km2 to 2 million km2 in a decade, reaching near ice-free September conditions by 2040. In the simulations, ice retreat accelerates as thinning increases the open water formation efficiency for a given melt rate and the ice-albedo feedback increases shortwave absorption. The retreat is abrupt when ocean heat transport to the Arctic is rapidly increasing. Analysis from multiple climate models and three forcing scenarios indicates that abrupt reductions occur in simulations from over 50% of the models and suggests that reductions in future greenhouse gas emissions moderate the likelihood of these events.

   abstract = {Recent observations and modelling studies suggest that the Arctic climate is undergoing important transition. One manifestation of this change is seen in the rapid sea-ice cover decrease as experienced in 2007 and 2012. Although most numerical climate models cannot adequately reproduce the recent changes, some models produce similar Rapid Ice Loss Events (RILEs) during the mid-21st-century. This study presents an analysis of four specific RILEs clustered around 2040 in three transient climate projections performed with the coupled Rossby Centre regional Atmosphere-Ocean model (RCAO). The analysis shows that long-term thinning causes increased vulnerability of the Arctic Ocean sea-ice cover. In the Atlantic sector, pre-conditioning (thinning of sea ice) combined with anomalous atmospheric and oceanic heat transport causes large ice loss, while in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean sea-ice albedo feedback appears important, particularly along the retreating sea-ice margin. Although maximum sea-ice loss occurs in the autumn, response in surface air temperature occurs in early winter, caused by strong increase in ocean-atmosphere surface energy fluxes, mainly the turbulent fluxes. Synchronicity of the events around 2040 in the projections is caused by a strong large-scale atmospheric circulation anomaly at the Atlantic lateral boundary of the regional model. The limited impact on land is caused by vertical propagation of the surface heat anomaly rather than horizontal, caused by the absence of low-level temperature inversion over the ocean. © 2013 J.-P.

According to the leading theory, ice-albedo feedback warms the Arctic Ocean during the summer, and the heat gained by the ocean is released during the winter, causing the cold-season warming. Screen and Simmonds (2010; SS10) concluded that the theory is correct by comparing trend patterns in surface air temperature (SAT), surface turbulence heat flux (HF), and net surface infrared radiation (IR). However, in this comparison, downward IR is more appropriate to use. By analyzing the same data used in SS10 using the surface energy budget, it is shown here that over most of the Arctic the skin temperature trend, which closely resembles the SAT trend, is largely accounted for by the downward IR, not the HF, trend.},

In polar regions, climate dynamics are controlled by both radiative and non-radiative interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, ice sheets and land surfaces. Precisely quantifying polar feedbacks is required for a process-oriented evaluation of climate models, a clear understanding of the processes responsible for polar climate changes, and a reduction in uncertainty associated with model projections. This quantification can be performed using a simple and consistent approach that is valid for a wide range of feedbacks, offering the opportunity for more systematic feedback analyses and a better understanding of polar climate changes.},

Associated anomalies in sensible and latent heat fluxes in autumn have increased Arctic atmospheric precipitable water and air temperatures, with the potential to impact autumn and winter cyclone activity. To examine if a connection exists between recent Arctic sea ice loss and cyclone activity, several cyclone metrics from 60° to 90°N are analyzed. Results show that following years with less September sea ice, there is a subsequent increase in moisture availability, regional baroclinicity, and changes in vertical stability that favor cyclogenesis. However, tracking of individual cyclones indicates no coherent increase in cyclone frequency or intensity associated with sea ice loss. Furthermore, no robust northward progression of extreme cyclones is observed.},

For example, East Asia has experienced several major cold events while the underlying temperature over the Arctic has risen steadily. To understand the influence of sea ice in the Barents Sea on atmospheric circulation during winter from a synoptic perspective, this study evaluated the downstream response in cyclone activities with respect to the underlying sea ice variability. The composite analysis, including all cyclone events over the Nordic seas, revealed that an anticyclonic anomaly prevailed along the Siberian coast during light ice years over the Barents Sea. This likely caused anomalous warm advection over the Barents Sea and cold advection over eastern Siberia. The difference in cyclone paths between heavy and light ice years was expressed as a warm-Arctic cold-Siberian (WACS) anomaly. The lower baroclinicity over the Barents Sea during the light ice years, which resulted from a weak gradient in sea surface temperature, prevented cyclones from traveling eastward. This could lead to fewer cyclones and hence to an anticyclonic anomaly over the Siberian coast. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {The salient features and drivers of wintertime warm and cold spells in the high Arctic are investigated. The analysis is based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis dataset. It is found that the warm spells are systematically associated with an intense sea level pressure and geopotential height anomaly dipole, displaying a low over the Arctic basin and a high over northern Eurasia. This configuration creates a natural pathway for extreme moisture influx episodes from the Atlantic sector into the Arctic (herein termed moisture intrusions). Anomalous cyclone frequency at the pole (largely attributable to local cyclogenesis) then favors a deep penetration of these intrusions across the Arctic basin. The large-scale circulation pattern associated with the warm spells further favors the advection of cold air across Siberia, leading to the so-called warm Arctic-cold Eurasia pattern previously discussed in the literature. On the contrary, cold Arctic extremes are associated with a severely reduced frequency of moisture intrusions and a persistent low pressure system over the pole. This effectively isolates the high latitudes from midlatitude air masses, favoring an intense radiative cooling of the polar region.},

This increased frequency of extreme cyclones is consistent with observed significant winter warming, indicating that the meridional heat and moisture transport they bring is a factor in rising temperatures in the region. The winter trend in extreme cyclones is dominated by a positive monthly trend of about 3-4 events/decade in November-December, due mainly to an increasing persistence of extreme cyclone events. A negative trend in January opposes this, while there is no significant trend in February. We relate the regional patterns of the trend in extreme cyclones to anomalously low sea-ice conditions in recent years, together with associated large-scale atmospheric circulation changes such as 'blockinglike' circulation patterns (e.g. Scandinavian blocking in December and Ural blocking during January-February).},

   abstract = {Rapid changes are occurring in the Arctic, including a reduction in sea ice thickness and coverage and a shift towards younger and thinner sea ice. Snow and sea ice models are often used to study these ongoing changes in the Arctic, and are typically forced by atmospheric reanalyses in absence of observations. ERA5 is a new global reanalysis that will replace the widely used ERA-Interim (ERA-I). In this study, we compare the 2&thinsp;m air temperature (T2M), snowfall (SF) and total precipitation (TP) from ERA-I and ERA5, and evaluate these products using buoy observations from Arctic sea ice for the years 2010 to 2016. We further assess how biases in reanalyses can influence the snow and sea ice evolution in the Arctic, when used to force a thermodynamic sea ice model. We find that ERA5 is generally warmer than ERA-I in winter and spring (0-1.2&thinsp;C), but colder than ERA-I in summer and autumn (0-0.6&thinsp;C) over Arctic sea ice. Both reanalyses have a warm bias over Arctic sea ice relative to buoy observations. The warm bias is smaller in the warm season, and larger in the cold season, especially when the T2M is below -25C in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors. Interestingly, the warm bias for ERA-I and new ERA5 is on average 3.4 and 5.4&thinsp;C (daily mean), respectively, when T2M is lower than -25C. The TP and SF along the buoy trajectories and over Arctic sea ice are consistently higher in ERA5 than in ERA-I. Over Arctic sea ice, the TP in ERA5 is typically less than 10&thinsp;mm snow water equivalent (SWE) greater than in ERA-I in any of the seasons, while the SF in ERA5 can be 50&thinsp;mm SWE higher than in ERA-I in a season. The largest increase in annual TP (40-100&thinsp;mm) and SF (100-200&thinsp;mm) in ERA5 occurs in the Atlantic sector. The SF to TP ratio is larger in ERA5 than in ERA-I, on average 0.6 for ERA-I and 0.8 for ERA5 along the buoy trajectories. Thus, the substantial anomalous Arctic rainfall in ERA-I is reduced in ERA5, especially in summer and autumn. Simulations with a 1-D thermodynamic sea ice model demonstrate that the warm bias in ERA5 acts to reduce thermodynamic ice growth. The higher precipitation and snowfall in ERA5 results in a thicker snowpack that allows less heat loss to the atmosphere. Thus, the larger winter warm bias and higher precipitation in ERA5, compared with ERA-I, result in thinner ice thickness at the end of the growth season when using ERA5; however the effect is small during the freezing period..},

Here we synthesise the interdisciplinary N-ICE2015 dataset, including independent observations of the atmosphere, snow, sea-ice, ocean, and ecosystem. We build upon recent results and illustrate the different mechanisms through which winter storms impact the coupled Arctic sea-ice system. These short-lived and episodic synoptic-scale events transport pulses of heat and moisture into the Arctic, which temporarily reduce radiative cooling and henceforth ice growth. Cumulative snowfall from each sequential storm deepens the snow pack and insulates the sea-ice, further inhibiting ice growth throughout the remaining winter season. Strong winds fracture the ice cover, enhance ocean-ice-atmosphere heat fluxes, and make the ice more susceptible to lateral melt. In conclusion, the legacy of Arctic winter storms for sea-ice and the ice-associated ecosystem in the Atlantic Sector lasts far beyond their short lifespan.},

The poleward transport of these warm airstreams occurred along an intense low-level jet between a series of cyclones and a quasi-stationary anticyclone. The complex 3-D configuration that enabled this transport was facilitated by continuous warm conveyor belt ascent into the upper part of the anticyclone. This study emphasizes the combined role of multiple transport processes and transient synoptic-scale dynamics for establishing an extreme Arctic warm event.},

We show that its magnitude was unprecedented and that it was associated with the transient response to the sudden stratospheric warming leading to anomalous warm southerly flow in north Greenland. Indeed, regional wind speeds and temperatures were the highest during February going back to the 1960s. There is evidence that the thinning sea ice has increased its wind-driven mobility. However, we show that the polynya would have developed under thicker ice conditions representative of the late 1970s and that even with the predicted trend toward thinner sea ice, it will only open during enhanced southerly flow.},

This paper briefly describes the S2S project in the context of extended range prediction of extreme events. We provide evidence that S2S forecasts have the potential to predict the onset, evolution and decay of some large-scale extreme events several weeks ahead. For instance, S2S models displayed skill to predict high probabilities of extreme 2-m temperature anomalies over Russia during the worst week of the 2010 Russian heat wave up to 3 weeks in advance. In other cases, like for tropical cyclone prediction, S2S models can produce useful information on the probability of the occurrence of tropical storms within sufficiently large areas through the prediction of large-scale predictors, such as the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO). In future, S2S forecasts of extreme events could be integrated into a “ready-set-go” framework between seasonal and medium range forecasts, by providing an early warning of an extreme event a few weeks in advance. Finally, S2S forecasts can also be used to investigate the causality of some extreme events and we show evidence that the cold March 2013 over western Europe and North Asia was linked to a MJO event propagating over the western Pacific.},

   abstract = {Robust projections and predictions of climate variability and change, particularly at regional scales, rely on the driving processes being represented with fidelity in model simulations. The role of enhanced horizontal resolution in improved process representation in all components of the climate system is of growing interest, particularly as some recent simulations suggest both the possibility of significant changes in large-scale aspects of circulation as well as improvements in small-scale processes and extremes. However, such high-resolution global simulations at climate timescales, with resolutions of at least 50 km in the atmosphere and 0.25° in the ocean, have been performed at relatively few research centres and generally without overall coordination, primarily due to their computational cost. Assessing the robustness of the response of simulated climate to model resolution requires a large multi-model ensemble using a coordinated set of experiments. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) is the ideal framework within which to conduct such a study, due to the strong link to models being developed for the CMIP DECK experiments and other model intercomparison projects (MIPs). Increases in high-performance computing (HPC) resources, as well as the revised experimental design for CMIP6, now enable a detailed investigation of the impact of increased resolution up to synoptic weather scales on the simulated mean climate and its variability. The High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) presented in this paper applies, for the first time, a multi-model approach to the systematic investigation of the impact of horizontal resolution. A coordinated set of experiments has been designed to assess both a standard and an enhanced horizontal-resolution simulation in the atmosphere and ocean. The set of HighResMIP experiments is divided into three tiers consisting of atmosphere-only and coupled runs and spanning the period 1950-2050, with the possibility of extending to 2100, together with some additional targeted experiments. This paper describes the experimental set-up of HighResMIP, the analysis plan, the connection with the other CMIP6 endorsed MIPs, as well as the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations. HighResMIP thereby focuses on one of the CMIP6 broad questions, "what are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?", but we also discuss how it addresses the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) grand challenges.},

It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850-near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: How does the Earth system respond to forcing What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

   abstract = {Detecting extreme events in large datasets is a major challenge in climate science research. Current algorithms for extreme event detection are build upon human expertise in defining events based on subjective thresholds of relevant physical variables. Often, multiple competing methods produce vastly different results on the same dataset. Accurate characterization of extreme events in climate simulations and observational data archives is critical for understanding the trends and potential impacts of such events in a climate change content. This study presents the first application of Deep Learning techniques as alternative methodology for climate extreme events detection. Deep neural networks are able to learn high-level representations of a broad class of patterns from labeled data. In this work, we developed deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification system and demonstrated the usefulness of Deep Learning technique for tackling climate pattern detection problems. Coupled with Bayesian based hyper-parameter optimization scheme, our deep CNN system achieves 89\%-99\% of accuracy in detecting extreme events (Tropical Cyclones, Atmospheric Rivers and Weather Fronts},

It has been suggested that these changes in environmental conditions have led to an increase in extreme cyclones in the region, therefore increasing this hazard. In this study, we investigate the response of Arctic synoptic scale cyclones to climate change in a large initial value ensemble of future climate projections with the CESM1-CAM5 climate model (CESM-LE). We find that the response of Arctic cyclones in these simulations varies with season, with significant reductions in cyclone dynamic intensity across the Arctic basin in winter, but with contrasting increases in summer intensity within the region known as the Arctic Ocean cyclone maximum. There is also a significant reduction in winter cyclogenesis events within the Greenland–Iceland–Norwegian sea region. We conclude that these differences in the response of cyclone intensity and cyclogenesis, with season, appear to be closely linked to changes in surface temperature gradients in the high latitudes, with Arctic poleward temperature gradients increasing in summer, but decreasing in winter.},

Robust, long-lead forecasts would therefore be valuable for managing policy responses. But despite decades of effort, forecasting ENSO events at lead times of more than one year remains problematic2. Here we show that a statistical forecast model employing a deep-learning approach produces skilful ENSO forecasts for lead times of up to one and a half years. To circumvent the limited amount of observation data, we use transfer learning to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) first on historical simulations3 and subsequently on reanalysis from 1871 to 1973. During the validation period from 1984 to 2017, the all-season correlation skill of the Nino3.4 index of the CNN model is much higher than those of current state-of-the-art dynamical forecast systems. The CNN model is also better at predicting the detailed zonal distribution of sea surface temperatures, overcoming a weakness of dynamical forecast models. A heat map analysis indicates that the CNN model predicts ENSO events using physically reasonable precursors. The CNN model is thus a powerful tool for both the prediction of ENSO events and for the analysis of their associated complex mechanisms.},

Expected consequences of increased Arctic warming include ongoing loss of land and sea ice, threats to wildlife and traditional human livelihoods, increased methane emissions, and extreme weather at lower latitudes. With low biodiversity, Antarctic ecosystems may be vulnerable to state shifts and species invasions.

Observational studies overwhelmingly support that AA is contributing to winter continental cooling. Although some model experiments support the observational evidence, most modelling results show little connection between AA and severe midlatitude weather or suggest the export of excess heating from the Arctic to lower latitudes. Divergent conclusions between model and observational studies, and even intramodel studies, continue to obfuscate a clear understanding of how AA is influencing midlatitude weather. Amplified warming in the Arctic has been linked to weather variability in the midlatitudes.

However, weather when considered globally is now in uncharted territory. Here we show that on the basis of a single day of globally observed temperature and moisture, we detect the fingerprint of externally driven climate change, and conclude that Earth as a whole is warming. Our detection approach invokes statistical learning and climate model simulations to encapsulate the relationship between spatial patterns of daily temperature and humidity, and key climate change metrics such as annual global mean temperature or Earth’s energy imbalance. Observations are projected onto this relationship to detect climate change. The fingerprint of climate change is detected from any single day in the observed global record since early 2012, and since 1999 on the basis of a year of data. Detection is robust even when ignoring the long-term global warming trend. This complements traditional climate change detection, but also opens broader perspectives for the communication of regional weather events, modifying the climate change narrative: while changes in weather locally are emerging over decades, global climate change is now detected instantaneously.},

   abstract = {This review addresses the causes of observed climate variations across the industrial period, from 1750 to present. It focuses on long-term changes, both in response to external forcing and to climate variability in the ocean and atmosphere. A synthesis of results from attribution studies based on palaeoclimatic reconstructions covering the recent few centuries to the 20th century, and instrumental data shows how greenhouse gases began to cause warming since the beginning of industrialization, causing trends that are attributable to greenhouse gases by 1900 in proxy-based temperature reconstructions. Their influence increased over time, dominating recent trends. However, other forcings have caused substantial deviations from this emerging greenhouse warming trend: volcanic eruptions have caused strong cooling following a period of unusually heavy activity, such as in the early 19th century; or warming during periods of low activity, such as in the early-to-mid 20th century. Anthropogenic aerosol forcing most likely masked some global greenhouse warming over the 20th century, especially since the accelerated increase in sulphate aerosol emissions starting around 1950. Based on modelling and attribution studies, aerosol forcing has also influenced regional temperatures, caused long-term changes in monsoons and imprinted on Atlantic variability. Multi-decadal variations in atmospheric modes can also cause long-term climate variability, as apparent for the example of the North Atlantic Oscillation, and have influenced Atlantic ocean variability. Long-term precipitation changes are more difficult to attribute to external forcing due to spatial sparseness of data and noisiness of precipitation changes, but the observed pattern of precipitation response to warming from station data supports climate model simulated changes and with it, predictions. The long-term warming has also led to significant differences in daily variability as, for example, visible in long European station data. Extreme events over the historical record provide valuable samples of possible extreme events and their mechanisms.},

Summer solar heat absorption by the surface waters has increased fivefold over the same time period, chiefly because of reduced sea ice coverage. It is shown that the solar heating, considered together with subduction rates of surface water in this region, is sufficient to account for the observed halocline warming. Heat absorption at the basin margins and its subsequent accumulation in the ocean interior, therefore, have consequences for Beaufort Gyre sea ice beyond the summer season.},

We here examine this question in reanalyses and state-of-the-art global climate models. In the Northern Hemisphere we find that the eddy heat flux has robustly weakened over the last four decades. We further show that this weakening emerged from the internal variability around the year 2000, and we attribute it to increasing greenhouse gases. In contrast, in the Southern Hemisphere we find that the eddy heat flux has robustly strengthened, and we link this strengthening to the recent multi-decadal cooling of Southern-Ocean surface temperatures. The inability of state-of-the-art climate models to simulate such cooling prevents them from capturing the observed Southern Hemisphere strengthening of the eddy heat flux. This discrepancy between models and reanalyses provides a clear example of how model biases in polar regions can affect the midlatitude climate.},

For two to three decades starting from the mid-1980s, accelerated Arctic warming and a reduced meridional near-surface temperature gradient coincided with a wavier circulation. However, waviness remains largely unchanged in model simulations featuring strong Arctic amplification. Here, we show that the previously reported trend toward a wavier circulation during autumn and winter has reversed in recent years, despite continued Arctic amplification, resulting in negligible multidecadal trends. Models capture the observed correspondence between a reduced temperature gradient and increased waviness on interannual to decadal time scales. However, model experiments in which a reduced temperature gradient is imposed do not feature increased wave amplitude. Our results strongly suggest that the observed and simulated covariability between waviness and temperature gradients on interannual to decadal time scales does not represent a forced response to Arctic amplification.},

   abstract = {Many problems in climate science require extracting forced signals from a background of internal climate variability. We demonstrate that artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a useful addition to the climate science “toolbox” for this purpose. Specifically, forced patterns are detected by an ANN trained on climate model simulations under historical and future climate scenarios. By identifying spatial patterns that serve as indicators of change in surface temperature and precipitation, the ANN can determine the approximate year from which the simulations came without first explicitly separating the forced signal from the noise of both internal climate variability and model uncertainty. Thus, the ANN indicator patterns are complex, nonlinear combinations of signal and noise and are identified from the 1960s onward in simulated and observed surface temperature maps. This approach suggests that viewing climate patterns through an artificial intelligence (AI) lens has the power to uncover new insights into climate variability and change.},

An exciting and relatively recent development is the uptake of machine learning in the natural sciences, where the major goal is to obtain novel scientific insights and discoveries from observational or simulated data. A prerequisite for obtaining a scientific outcome is domain knowledge, which is needed to gain explainability, but also to enhance scientific consistency. In this article we review explainable machine learning in view of applications in the natural sciences and discuss three core elements which we identified as relevant in this context: transparency, interpretability, and explainability. With respect to these core elements, we provide a survey of recent scientific works that incorporate machine learning and the way that explainable machine learning is used in combination with domain knowledge from the application areas.},

   abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are characterized by intense moisture transport, which, on landfall, produce precipitation which can be both beneficial and destructive. ARs in California, for example, are known to have ended drought conditions but also to have caused substantial socio-economic damage from landslides and flooding linked to extreme precipitation. Understanding how AR characteristics will respond to a warming climate is, therefore, vital to the resilience of communities affected by them, such as the western USA, Europe, East Asia and South Africa. In this Review, we use a theoretical framework to synthesize understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic responses of ARs to anthropogenic warming and connect them to observed and projected changes and impacts revealed by observations and complex models. Evidence suggests that increased atmospheric moisture (governed by Clausius–Clapeyron scaling) will enhance the intensity of AR-related precipitation — and related hydrological extremes — but with changes that are ultimately linked to topographic barriers. However, due to their dependency on both weather and climate-scale processes, which themselves are often poorly constrained, projections are uncertain. To build confidence and improve resilience, future work must focus efforts on characterizing the multiscale development of ARs and in obtaining observations from understudied regions, including the West Pacific, South Pacific and South Atlantic. Due to their intense moisture transport, atmospheric rivers are associated with hydrological hazards such as extreme rainfall and flooding. This Review discusses how atmospheric-river characteristics and impacts may change with warming, synthesizing physical theory, observations and modelling.},

Persistent Ural blocking anomalies in November are associated with a warm Arctic/cold Siberia pattern and increased upward planetary waves entering the stratosphere, leading to a warming of the polar vortex. This stratospheric response then propagates in the troposphere, leading to increased occurrence of the negative North Atlantic Oscillation in December and January. In contrast, simulations with perturbed Barents-Kara sea ice and Siberian snow in November do not reproduce a significant atmospheric response. In simulations including a slab ocean, the Ural blocking induces Barents-Kara sea ice and Siberia snow anomalies that resemble composite analyses from observations. These results highlight Ural blocking variability in November as a robust driver of early-winter stratospheric warming while questioning causality between sea ice/snow and Ural blocking anomalies.},

Here we apply causal discovery algorithms to sea level pressure data from a large set of climate model simulations and, as a proxy for observations, meteorological reanalyses. We demonstrate how the resulting causal networks (fingerprints) offer an objective pathway for process-oriented model evaluation. Models with fingerprints closer to observations better reproduce important precipitation patterns over highly populated areas such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, East Asia, Europe and North America. We further identify expected model interdependencies due to shared development backgrounds. Finally, our network metrics provide stronger relationships for constraining precipitation projections under climate change as compared to traditional evaluation metrics for storm tracks or precipitation itself. Such emergent relationships highlight the potential of causal networks to constrain longstanding uncertainties in climate change projections. Algorithms to assess causal relationships in data sets have seen increasing applications in climate science in recent years. Here, the authors show that these techniques can help to systematically evaluate the performance of climate models and, as a result, to constrain uncertainties in future climate change projections.},

The effects of Arctic sea-ice loss are not limited to the northern high latitudes, and reach deep into the tropics. Yet little is known about the effects of future Antarctic sea-ice loss outside of the southern high latitudes. Here, using a fully coupled climate model, we investigate the tropical response to Antarctic sea-ice loss and compare it with the response to Arctic sea-ice loss. We show that Antarctic sea-ice loss, similar to Arctic sea-ice loss, causes enhanced warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific and an equatorward intensification of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. We demonstrate that Antarctic sea-ice loss causes a mini global warming signal comparable to the one caused by Arctic sea-ice loss, and reminiscent of the response to greenhouse gases. We also show that ocean dynamics are key to capturing the tropical response to sea-ice loss. In short, we find that future Antarctic sea-ice loss will exert a profound influence on the tropics. Combined Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice losses will account for 20–30% of the projected tropical warming and precipitation changes under the high-emissions scenario Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Antarctic sea-ice loss causes enhanced warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific, and together with Arctic sea-ice loss accounts for 20–30% of projected warming and rainfall changes in the tropics, suggest climate model simulations.},

   abstract = {Independent verification of anthropogenic influence on specific extreme climate events remains elusive. This study presents a framework for such verification. This framework reveals that previously published results based on a 1961–2005 attribution period frequently underestimate the influence of global warming on the probability of unprecedented extremes during the 2006–2017 period. This underestimation is particularly pronounced for hot and wet events, with greater uncertainty for dry events. The underestimation is reflected in discrepancies between probabilities predicted during the attribution period and frequencies observed during the out-of-sample verification period. These discrepancies are most explained by increases in climate forcing between the attribution and verification periods, suggesting that 21st-century global warming has substantially increased the probability of unprecedented hot and wet events. Hence, the use of temporally lagged periods for attribution—and, more broadly, for extreme event probability quantification—can cause underestimation of historical impacts, and current and future risks.},

   abstract = {<p><![CDATA[Abstract. Most Earth system models (ESMs) are running under different high-performance computing (HPC) environments. This has several advantages, from allowing different groups to work with the same tool in parallel to leveraging the burden of ensemble climate simulations, but it also offers alternative solutions in the case of shutdown (expected or not) of any of the environments. However, for obvious scientific reasons, it is critical to ensure that ESMs provide identical results under changes in computing environment. While strict bit-for-bit reproducibility is not always guaranteed with ESMs, it is desirable that results obtained under one computing environment are at least statistically indistinguishable from those obtained under another environment, which we term a “replicability” condition following the metrology nomenclature. Here, we develop a protocol to assess the replicability of the EC-Earth ESM. Using two versions of EC-Earth, we present one case of non-replicability and one case of replicability. The non-replicable case occurs with the older version of the model and likely finds its origin in the treatment of river runoff along Antarctic coasts. By contrast, the more recent version of the model provides replicable results. The methodology presented here has been adopted as a standard test by the EC-Earth consortium (27 institutions in Europe) to evaluate the replicability of any new model version across platforms, including for CMIP6 experiments. To a larger extent, it can be used to assess whether other ESMs can safely be ported from one HPC environment to another for studying climate-related questions. Our results and experience with this work suggest that the default assumption should be that ESMs are not replicable under changes in the HPC environment, until proven otherwise.]]></p>},

These data enhance the assessment of climate change risks, including extreme events, and offer a powerful testbed for new methodologies aimed at separating forced signals from internal variability in the observational record. Opportunities and challenges confronting the design and dissemination of future LEs, including increased spatial resolution and model complexity alongside emerging Earth system applications, are discussed.

We focus on the standard resolution of the fully coupled physical model designed to address DOE mission-relevant water cycle questions. Its components include atmosphere and land (110-km grid spacing), ocean and sea ice (60 km in the midlatitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles), and river transport (55 km) models. This base configuration will also serve as a foundation for additional configurations exploring higher horizontal resolution as well as augmented capabilities in the form of biogeochemistry and cryosphere configurations. The performance of E3SMv1 is evaluated by means of a standard set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima simulations consisting of a long preindustrial control, historical simulations (ensembles of fully coupled and prescribed SSTs) as well as idealized CO2 forcing simulations. The model performs well overall with biases typical of other CMIP-class models, although the simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is weaker than many CMIP-class models. While the E3SMv1 historical ensemble captures the bulk of the observed warming between preindustrial (1850) and present day, the trajectory of the warming diverges from observations in the second half of the twentieth century with a period of delayed warming followed by an excessive warming trend. Using a two-layer energy balance model, we attribute this divergence to the model's strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing (ERFari+aci = −1.65 W/m2) and high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS = 5.3 K).},

Vertical resolution was increased (from 30 to 72 layers), and the model top extended to 60 km (~0.1 hPa). A simple ozone photochemistry predicts stratospheric ozone, and the model now supports increased and more realistic variability in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. An optional improved treatment of light-absorbing particle deposition to snowpack and ice is available, and stronger connections with Earth system biogeochemistry can be used for some science problems. Satellite and ground-based cloud and aerosol simulators were implemented to facilitate evaluation of clouds, aerosols, and aerosol-cloud interactions. Higher horizontal and vertical resolution, increased complexity, and more predicted and transported variables have increased the model computational cost and changed the simulations considerably. These changes required development of alternate strategies for tuning and evaluation as it was not feasible to “brute force” tune the high-resolution configurations, so short-term hindcasts, perturbed parameter ensemble simulations, and regionally refined simulations provided guidance on tuning and parameterization sensitivity to higher resolution.

The finite volume (FV) dynamical core is now the default because of its superior transport and conservation properties. Deep convection parameterization changes include a dilute plume calculation of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the introduction of convective momentum transport (CMT). An additional cloud fraction calculation is now performed following macrophysical state updates to provide improved thermodynamic consistency. A freeze-drying modification is further made to the cloud fraction calculation in very dry environments (e.g., the Arctic), where cloud fraction and cloud water values were often inconsistent in CAM3. In CAM4 the FV dynamical core further degrades the excessive trade-wind simulation, but reduces zonal stress errors at higher latitudes. Plume dilution alleviates much of the midtropospheric tropical dry biases and reduces the persistent monsoon precipitation biases over the Arabian Peninsula and the southern Indian Ocean. CMT reduces much of the excessive trade-wind biases in eastern ocean basins. CAM4 shows a global reduction in cloud fraction compared to CAM3, primarily as a result of the freeze-drying and improved cloud fraction equilibrium modifications. Regional climate feature improvements include the propagation of stationary waves from the Pacific into midlatitudes and the seasonal frequency of Northern Hemisphere blocking events. A 1° versus 2° horizontal resolution of the FV dynamical core exhibits superior improvements in regional climate features of precipitation and surface stress. Improvements in the fully coupled mean climate between CAM3 and CAM4 are also more substantial than in forced sea surface temperature (SST) simulations.</p>},

Although observed for many decades, the QBO is difficult to be accurately captured in Earth system models. The newly developed U.S. Department of Energy Energy Exascale Earth System Model, Version 1 (E3SMv1) is capable of resolving stratospheric dynamics as it has a top at 0.1 hPa and 72 levels. The tropical oscillation of the zonal mean zonal wind in the default version of the model is too fast and too strong compared to the observed QBO. Here we evaluate the current simulation of the QBO and present simulations with modified convective gravity wave parameterization parameters that make the oscillation more realistic, especially in terms of the period. Although improvements in the QBO are obtained through modifications to the parameterized gravity waves, we find that the forcing of the QBO from Kelvin and mixed-Rossby gravity waves is small due to weak sources in the troposphere. The changes to the parameterized convective gravity waves (and QBO) are primarily limited to the tropical stratosphere. Small changes to mean wind and temperature are also found in Northern Hemisphere winter in the uppermost troposphere between 10°N and 60°N. Modifications to parameterized convectively generated gravity waves result in changes in interannual variability, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, and modest changes in sea level pressure variability over the Pacific are also noted.},

For AMIP, observed monthly mean SSTs and sea-ice concentration have been compiled for the period January 1979 through February 1996 and also for the month preceding and for several months following the designated AMIP II period. These observed monthly means do not constitute the official AMIP II "boundary conditions," but the boundary conditions are based on them, as explained in this brief report. In AMIP II the SST and sea-ice concentration boundary conditions should be specified such that the monthly means computed from the model output precisely agree with the observed monthly means. There are several ways to assure compliance with this AMIP II requirement, but for most models which rely on linear interpolation between monthly values, appropriate AMIP II boundary condition data sets can be obtained from the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI).},

MERRA-2 assimilates observation types not available to its predecessor, MERRA, and includes updates to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model and analysis scheme so as to provide a viable ongoing climate analysis beyond MERRA's terminus. While addressing known limitations of MERRA, MERRA-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis (IESA) currently under development at GMAO. This paper provides an overview of the MERRA-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in MERRA-2 relevant to IESA are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of MERRA-2 compared with MERRA include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified. Production of MERRA-2 began in June 2014 in four processing streams and converged to a single near-real-time stream in mid-2015.

Some studies suggest that reduced autumn sea ice may be a precursor to severe midlatitude winters. Here we use coupled ocean–atmosphere model experiments to investigate the extent to which the winter atmospheric circulation response to Arctic sea ice loss is driven by sea ice loss in preceding months. We impose different seasonal cycles of sea ice by using various combinations of sea ice albedo parameters. Year-round sea ice loss causes an equatorward migration of the eddy-driven jet and a shift toward the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation in winter. However, these circulation changes are not found when sea ice is reduced only in late summer and autumn, despite high-latitude warming persisting into the winter. Our results imply that the winter atmospheric circulation response to sea ice loss is primarily driven by sea ice loss in winter rather than in autumn.},

Results from numerical experiments using an atmospheric general circulation model support these notions. The remote response in early winter is regarded as a stationary Rossby wave generated thermally through an anomalous turbulent heat fluxes as a result of anomalous ice-cover over the Barents-Kara Seas in late autumn, which tends to induce an amplification of the Siberian high causing colder conditions over the Far East. The late-winter cold anomalies over Eurasia are also reproduced in our experiment, which is associated with the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation.

   abstract = {<p>Atmospheric reanalyses can be useful tools for examining climate variability and change; however, they must be used cautiously because of time-varying biases that can induce artificial trends. This study explicitly documents a discontinuity in the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) that leads to significantly exaggerated warming in the Arctic mid- to lower troposphere, and demonstrates that the continuing use of ERA-40 to study Arctic temperature trends is problematic. The discontinuity occurs in 1997 in response to refined processing of satellite radiances prior to their assimilation into the reanalysis model. It is clearly apparent in comparisons of ERA-40 output against satellite-derived air temperatures, in situ observations, and alternative reanalyses. Decadal or multidecadal Arctic temperature trends calculated over periods that include 1997 are highly inaccurate, particularly below 600 hPa. It is shown that ERA-40 is poorly suited to studying Arctic temperature trends and their vertical profile, and conclusions based upon them must be viewed with extreme caution. Consequently, its future use for this purpose is discouraged. In the context of the wider scientific debate on the suitability of reanalyses for trend analyses, the results show that a series of alternative reanalyses are in broad-scale agreement with observations. Thus, the authors encourage their discerning use instead of ERA-40 for examining Arctic climate change while also reaffirming the importance of verifying reanalyses with observations whenever possible.</p>},

By analyzing data and model simulations, here we show that large AA occurs only from October to April and only over areas with significant sea-ice loss. AA largely disappears when Arctic sea ice is fixed or melts away. Periods with larger AA are associated with larger sea-ice loss, and models with bigger sea-ice loss produce larger AA. Increased outgoing longwave radiation and heat fluxes from the newly opened waters cause AA, whereas all other processes can only indirectly contribute to AA by melting sea-ice. We conclude that sea-ice loss is necessary for the existence of large AA and that models need to simulate Arctic sea ice realistically in order to correctly simulate Arctic warming under increasing CO 2 .},

   abstract = {Spatiotemporal patterns of recent (1979-2008) air temperature trends are evaluated using three reanalysis datasets and radiosonde data. Our analysis demonstrates large discrepancies between the reanalysis datasets, possibly due to differences in the data assimilation procedures as well as sparseness and inhomogeneity of high-latitude observations. We test the robustness of arctic tropospheric warming based on the ERA-40 dataset. ERA-40 Arctic atmosphere temperatures tend to be closer to the observed ones in terms of root mean square error compared to other reanalysis products used in the article. However, changes in the ERA-40 data assimilation procedure produce unphysical jumps in atmospheric temperatures, which may be the likely reason for the elevated tropospheric warming trend in 1979-2002. NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data show that the near-surface upward temperature trend over the same period is greater than the tropospheric trend, which is consistent with direct radiosonde observations and inconsistent with ERA-40 results. A change of sign in the winter temperature trend from negative to positive in the late 1980s is documented in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere with a maximum over the Canadian Arctic, based on radiosonde data. This change from cooling to warming tendency is associated with weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex and shift of its center toward the Siberian coast and possibly can be explained by the changes in the dynamics of the Arctic Oscillation. This temporal pattern is consistent with multi-decadal variations of key arctic climate parameters like, for example, surface air temperature and oceanic freshwater content. Elucidating the mechanisms behind these changes will be critical to understanding the complex nature of high-latitude variability and its impact on global climate change. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {<p>The role of extratropical ocean warming in the coupled climate response to Arctic sea ice loss is investigated using coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) and uncoupled atmospheric-only (AGCM) experiments. Coupled AOGCM experiments driven by sea ice albedo reduction and greenhouse gas–dominated radiative forcing are used to diagnose the extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) response to sea ice loss. Sea ice loss is then imposed in AGCM experiments both with and without these extratropical SST changes, which are found to extend beyond the regions where sea ice is lost. Sea ice loss in isolation drives warming that is confined to the Arctic lower troposphere and only a weak atmospheric circulation response. When the extratropical SST response caused by sea ice loss is also included in the forcing, the warming extends into the Arctic midtroposphere during winter. This coincides with a stronger atmospheric circulation response, including an equatorward shift in the eddy-driven jet, a deepening of the Aleutian low, and an expansion of the Siberian high. Similar results are found whether the extratropical SST forcing is taken directly from the AOGCM driven by sea ice loss, or whether they are diagnosed using a two-parameter pattern scaling technique where tropical adjustment to sea ice loss is removed. These results suggest that AGCM experiments that are driven by sea ice loss and only local SST increases will underestimate the Arctic midtroposphere warming and atmospheric circulation response to sea ice loss, compared to AOGCM simulations and the real world.</p>},

Debate continues on the relative roles of local factors, such as sea ice reductions, versus remote factors in driving, or amplifying, Arctic warming. This study examines the vertical profile and seasonality of observed tropospheric warming, and addresses its causes using atmospheric general circulation model simulations. The simulations enable the isolation and quantification of the role of three controlling factors of Arctic warming: 1) observed Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) changes; 2) observed remote SST changes; and 3) direct radiative forcing (DRF) due to observed changes in greenhouse gases, ozone, aerosols, and solar output. Local SIC and SST changes explain a large portion of the observed Arctic near-surface warming, whereas remote SST changes explain the majority of observed warming aloft. DRF has primarily contributed to Arctic tropospheric warming in summer. Copyright © 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {<p>There is an ongoing debate over whether accelerated Arctic warming [Arctic amplification (AA)] is altering the large-scale circulation responsible for the anomalous weather experienced by midlatitude regions in recent years. Among the proposed mechanisms is the idea that local processes associated with sea ice loss heat the lower troposphere at high latitudes, thus weakening the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and driving changes in quasi-stationary waves, the midlatitude jets, and storm tracks. It is further hypothesized that these circulation changes are conducive to persistent weather patterns. Because of the short observational record and large atmospheric internal variability, it is difficult to identify robust relationships and infer causality. Here, a simplified, linear, steady-state model is used to investigate the direct response of the midlatitude atmospheric circulation to thermal forcing in the Arctic. The results suggest that there is a weak midlatitude circulation response to an idealized, but representative, Arctic heating perturbation. Further, the stationary wave responses are shown to be well within the bounds of internal variability. A midlatitude response is excited if the idealized heating penetrates up to the tropopause. Such deep, persistent heating is not observed on average during the AA period but does suggest a pathway for Arctic–midlatitude linkages under specific conditions. This study adds to the growing body of work suggesting that warming in the lower troposphere associated with Arctic amplification is not currently a direct driver of anomalous midlatitude circulation changes.</p>},

   abstract = {The polar region has been one of the fastest warming places on Earth in response to greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. Two distinct processes contribute to the observed warming signal: (i) local warming in direct response to the GHG forcing and (ii) the effect of enhanced poleward heat transport from low latitudes. A series of aquaplanet experiments, which excludes the surface albedo feedback, is conducted to quantify the relative contributions of these two physical processes to the polar warming magnitude and degree of amplification relative to the global mean. The globe is divided into zonal bands with equal area in eight experiments. For each of these, an external heating is prescribed beneath the slab ocean layer in the respective forcing bands. The summation of the individual temperature responses to each local heating in these experiments is very similar to the response to a globally uniform heating. This allows the authors to decompose the polar warming and amplification signal into the effects of local and remote heating. Local polar heating that induces surface-trapped warming due to the large tropospheric static stability in this region accounts for about half of the polar surface warming. Cloud radiative effects act to enhance this local contribution. In contrast, remote nonpolar heating induces a robust polar warming pattern that features a midtropospheric peak, regardless of the meridional location of the forcing. Among all remote forcing experiments, the deep tropical forcing case contributes most to the polar-amplified surface warming pattern relative to the global mean, while the high-latitude forcing cases contribute most to enhancing the polar surface warming magnitude.},

   abstract = {Surface air temperature over central Eurasia decreased over the past twenty-five winters at a time of strongly increasing anthropogenic forcing and Arctic amplification. It has been suggested that this cooling was related to an increase in cold winters due to sea-ice loss in the Barents-Kara Sea. Here we use over 600 years of atmosphere-only global climate model simulations to isolate the effect of Arctic sea-ice loss, complemented with a 50-member ensemble of atmosphere-ocean global climate model simulations allowing for external forcing changes (anthropogenic and natural) and internal variability. In our atmosphere-only simulations, we find no evidence of Arctic sea-ice loss having impacted Eurasian surface temperature. In our atmosphere-ocean simulations, we find just one simulation with Eurasian cooling of the observed magnitude but Arctic sea-ice loss was not involved, either directly or indirectly. Rather, in this simulation the cooling is due to a persistent circulation pattern combining high pressure over the Barents-Kara Sea and a downstream trough. We conclude that the observed cooling over central Eurasia was probably due to a sea-ice-independent internally generated circulation pattern ensconced over, and nearby, the Barents-Kara Sea since the 1980s. These results improve our knowledge of high-latitude climate variability and change, with implications for our understanding of impacts in high-northern-latitude systems.},

It resembles the NAO in many respects; but its primary center of action covers more of the Arctic, giving it a more zonally symmetric appearance. Coupled to strong fluctuations at the 50-hPa level on the intraseasonal, interannual, and interdecadal time scales, this 'Arctic Oscillation' (AO) can be interpreted as the surface signature of modulations in the strength of the polar vortex aloft. It is proposed that the zonally asymmetric surface air temperature and mid-tropospheric circulation anomalies observed in association with the AO may be secondary baroclinic features induced by the land-sea contrasts. The same modal structure is mirrored in the pronounced trends in winter and springtime surface air temperature, sea-level pressure, and 50-hPa height over the past 30 years: parts of Eurasia have warmed by as much as several K, sea-level pressure over parts of the Arctic has fallen by 4 hPa, and the core of the lower stratospheric polar vortex has cooled by several K. These trends can be interpreted as the development of a systematic bias in one of the atmosphere's dominant, naturally occurring modes of variability.},

In contrast, midlatitude atmospheric circulation anomalies coinciding with Arctic surface warm anomalies were barely statistically significant during 1979–1996. The associated strong anomalous ascending/descending motions and divergent/convergent upper troposphere air masses over the Arctic-Eurasian sector seem to have favored the midlatitude-Arctic linkage during 1997–2017. We further hypothesize that Arctic mid-tropospheric warming plays a crucial role for the linkage between midlatitudes and Arctic in boreal winter. Multi-model simulations support this, and also point to internal atmospheric variability as the cause for the interdecadal shift in the strength of the midlatitude-Arctic linkage.},

   abstract = {Near-surface warming in the Arctic has been almost twice as large as the global average over recent decades - a phenomenon that is known as the 'Arctic amplification'. The underlying causes of this temperature amplification remain uncertain. The reduction in snow and ice cover that has occurred over recent decades may have played a role. Climate model experiments indicate that when global temperature rises, Arctic snow and ice cover retreats, causing excessive polar warming. Reduction of the snow and ice cover causes albedo changes, and increased refreezing of sea ice during the cold season and decreases in sea-ice thickness both increase heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere. Changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation, as well as cloud cover, have also been proposed to cause Arctic temperature amplification. Here we examine the vertical structure of temperature change in the Arctic during the late twentieth century using reanalysis data. We find evidence for temperature amplification well above the surface. Snow and ice feedbacks cannot be the main cause of the warming aloft during the greater part of the year, because these feedbacks are expected to primarily affect temperatures in the lowermost part of the atmosphere, resulting in a pattern of warming that we only observe in spring. A significant proportion of the observed temperature amplification must therefore be explained by mechanisms that induce warming above the lowermost part of the atmosphere. We regress the Arctic temperature field on the atmospheric energy transport into the Arctic and find that, in the summer half-year, a significant proportion of the vertical structure of warming can be explained by changes in this variable. We conclude that changes in atmospheric heat transport may be an important cause of the recent Arctic temperature amplification. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

   abstract = {We outline a new and improved uncertainty analysis for the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature product version 4 (GISTEMP v4). Historical spatial variations in surface temperature anomalies are derived from historical weather station data and ocean data from ships, buoys, and other sensors. Uncertainties arise from measurement uncertainty, changes in spatial coverage of the station record, and systematic biases due to technology shifts and land cover changes. Previously published uncertainty estimates for GISTEMP included only the effect of incomplete station coverage. Here, we update this term using currently available spatial distributions of source data, state-of-the-art reanalyses, and incorporate independently derived estimates for ocean data processing, station homogenization, and other structural biases. The resulting 95% uncertainties are near 0.05 °C in the global annual mean for the last 50 years and increase going back further in time reaching 0.15 °C in 1880. In addition, we quantify the benefits and inherent uncertainty due to the GISTEMP interpolation and averaging method. We use the total uncertainties to estimate the probability for each record year in the GISTEMP to actually be the true record year (to that date) and conclude with 86% likelihood that 2016 was indeed the hottest year of the instrumental period (so far).},

Until recently, seasonal variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation was thought to be largely driven by chaotic and inherently unpredictable processes. However, latest generation seasonal forecasting systems have demonstrated significant skill in predicting the North Atlantic Oscillation when initialized a month before the onset of winter. Here we extend skilful dynamical model predictions to more than a year ahead. The skill increases greatly with ensemble size due to a spuriously small signal-to-noise ratio in the model, and consequently larger ensembles are projected to further increase the skill in predicting the North Atlantic Oscillation. We identify two sources of skill for second-winter forecasts of the North Atlantic Oscillation: climate variability in the tropical Pacific region and predictable effects of solar forcing on the stratospheric polar vortex strength. We also identify model biases in Arctic sea ice that, if reduced, may further increase skill. Our results open possibilities for a range of new climate services, including for the transport, energy, water management and insurance sectors.},

   abstract = {This study investigates the influence of atmospheric initial conditions on winter seasonal forecasts of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Hindcast (or reforecast) experiments – which differ only in their initial conditions – are performed over the period 1960–2009, using prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) and sea-ice boundary conditions. The first experiment (“ERA-40/Int IC”) is initialized using the ERA-40 and ERA-Interim reanalysis datasets, which assimilate upper-air, satellite and surface observations; the second experiment (“ERA-20C IC”) is initialized using the ERA-20C reanalysis dataset, which assimilates only surface observations. The ensemble mean NAO skill is largest in ERA-40/Int IC (r = 0.54), which is initialized with the superior reanalysis data. Moreover, ERA-20C IC did not exhibit significantly more NAO hindcast skill (r = 0.38) than in a third experiment, which was initialized with incorrect (shuffled) initial conditions. The ERA-40/Interim and ERA-20C initial conditions differ substantially in the tropical stratosphere, where the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of zonal winds is not present in ERA-20C. The QBO hindcasts are highly skilful in ERA-40/Int IC – albeit with a somewhat weaker equatorial zonal wind amplitude in the lower stratosphere – but are incorrect in ERA-20C IC, indicating that the QBO is responsible for the additional NAO hindcast skill; this is despite the model exhibiting a relatively weak teleconnection between the QBO and NAO. The influence of the QBO is further demonstrated by regressing out the QBO influence from each of the hindcast experiments, after which the difference in NAO hindcast skill between the experiments is negligible. Whilst ERA-40/Int IC demonstrates a more skilful NAO hindcast, it appears to have a relatively weak predictable signal; this is the so-called “signal-to-noise paradox” identified in previous studies. Diagnostically amplifying the (weak) QBO–NAO teleconnection increases the ensemble-mean NAO signal with negligible impact on the NAO hindcast skill, after which the signal-to-noise problem seemingly disappears.},

Experimentation covering a recent 8year high-skill period demonstrates the predictability of the model AO to be dominated by atmospheric initial conditions, although surface forcing does have increasing influence later in the winter. Results suggest that the stratosphere is an important carrier of model predictability during the early winter. These results challenge the conventional paradigm of surface forcing being the dominant source of predictability on seasonal time scales but are compatible with the results showing stratospheric influence on winter circulation. They also suggest that model representation of stratospheric to tropospheric coupling needs urgent improvement.},

The quality of ERA-Interim/Land is assessed by comparing with ground-based and remote sensing observations. In particular, estimates of soil moisture, snow depth, surface albedo, turbulent latent and sensible fluxes, and river discharges are verified against a large number of site measurements.

However, causality of this covariability remains unclear. Here, we address this issue using atmospheric model experiments prescribed with observed sea surface temperature variations and either constant or time-varying sea ice variability. We show that the observed relationship between late-autumn Barents-Kara sea ice and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation can be reproduced by simulated atmospheric internal variability but is not simulated as a forced response to sea ice. Observations and models suggest reduced sea ice is linked to a weaker Aleutian Low. We show that simulated Aleutian Low variability is correlated with observed sea ice variability even in simulations with fixed sea ice, implying that this relationship is not incidental. Instead, we suggest that covariability between sea ice and the Aleutian Low originates from tropical sea surface temperature and rainfall variations and their teleconnections to the extratropics.},

@article{Screen2019b,
   abstract = {In a recent Letter, Mori et al. 1 examined connections in observations and climate models between reduced Arctic sea ice and the 'warm Arctic and cold Eurasia' (WACE) pattern. They concluded that models systemically underestimate Eurasian cooling in response to sea-ice loss, relative to observations. If correct, their result implies that up to half of the observed Eurasian cooling from 1995-2014 is attributable to sea-ice loss 1 , whereas previous studies have found a negligible contribution from sea-ice loss 2-4. Here, we highlight that their comparisons between observations and models are not like-for-like, and show that when fair comparisons are made, modelled and observed estimates are consistent with each other. The upward adjustment of the contribution of sea-ice loss to observed Eurasian cooling in Mori et al. 1 is therefore unjustified. An essential first step in model evaluation is to derive an observational benchmark against which models can be assessed. Mori et al. 1 seek an observational estimate of the WACE response to Barents-Kara sea-ice loss. Their approach is to correlate time series of the WACE pattern and Barents-Kara sea ice. They interpret the squared correlation coefficient multiplied by the WACE variance (hereafter r 2 σ 2) as the fraction of WACE variance driven by sea ice. In doing so, they make an assumption about causality. Their apparent justification for this causal inference is that their analysis detects WACE as the main pattern of sea-ice-driven temperature variability. However, the WACE pattern also varies irrespective of sea ice and, as a result, their observed time series of the WACE (EC ERA) contains both variability driven by sea ice and variability not driven by sea ice. It is important to note that even the non-sea-ice-driven component will correlate with Barents-Kara sea ice because a warm Arctic causes reduced sea ice, and vice versa. Sea ice and WACE variability will correlate because the Arctic temperature and sea ice are strongly and physically connected, even if Eurasian temperature is minimally affected by sea ice, as recent work suggests 5. For the reasons just given, the interpretation of r 2 σ 2 as the fraction of WACE variance driven by sea ice is questionable and, as we will demonstrate, it is probably an overestimation. Mori et al. 1 also calculate r 2 σ 2 from atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments in which sea ice is specified. The interaction between ice and the atmosphere is only in one direction in this experimental setup: the atmospheric response to varying sea ice is represented, but the response of sea ice to atmospheric variation is not. Mori et al. 1 report that the observed r 2 σ 2 value is roughly twice as high as those obtained from seven different AGCMs, leading them to conclude that models systemically underestimate the WACE response to sea-ice loss. However, their comparison between observations and AGCMs is misleading because the observed r 2 σ 2 reflects two-way interactions between sea ice and the atmosphere, rather than the one-way influence of sea ice on the atmosphere in AGCM-derived r 2 σ 2. Here, we test the extent to which r 2 σ 2 is suppressed by a lack of two-way interactions in AGCM simulations. We first reproduced the results of Mori et al. 1 (with minor methodological differences; see Methods), which confirms that none of the seven AGCMs reproduce the observed r 2 σ 2 (Fig. 1a). It is important to note that this discrepancy is seen in both the winter months collectively (Fig. 1a) and in winter averages (see fig. 4a in Mori et al. 1), which strongly suggests that the origin of the model-observation disparity is not timescale dependent , and justifies our use of monthly averages in what follows. Next, we compared output from an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) and an AGCM prescribed with sea ice and sea surface temperatures taken from the parent AOGCM (see Methods). The r 2 σ 2 value in the AOGCM experiment is roughly twice as high as that in the AGCM (Fig. 1b), which we attribute to the simulation of two-way atmosphere-ice interaction in the AOGCM not present in the AGCM. The smaller r 2 σ 2 value in AGCMs compared with observations shown originally by Mori et al. 1 and reproduced here in Fig. 1a need not imply model error. Instead, it could be largely explained by the lack of two-way interaction in AGCM experiments and the inability of the r 2 σ 2 method to extract the sea-ice-driven fraction of observed WACE variability. We caution against directly comparing the observed (Fig. 1a) and AOGCM-derived (Fig. 1b) r 2 σ 2 values as they correspond to different climate states. Although the observed r 2 σ 2 is higher than in the AOGCM, this probably reflects greater sea-ice variability (by ~50%; not shown) in the recent past compared with the pre-industrial climate, rather than model error. We note that the higher r 2 σ 2 value in the AOGCM compared with the AGCM (Fig. 1b) could arise due to one of two reasons: coupling is necessary to simulate the effects of WACE variability on sea ice, or ocean feedbacks amplify the WACE response to sea-ice loss. Regarding the former, coupled models simulate the effects of WACE-related atmospheric circulation variability on Barents-Kara sea ice similarly to the real world 5. Regarding the latter, it is clear that ocean feedbacks would strengthen the local warming response to sea-ice loss. However, this need not imply any change in Eurasian cooling. Indeed, Deser et al. 6 showed that ocean coupling enhanced the Arctic warming and atmospheric circulation responses to sea-ice loss, but suppressed Eurasian cooling. Surveying the literature, there is no evidence that coupled models simulate stronger Eurasian cooling in response to sea-ice loss than uncoupled models 6-10. To gain further insight, and building on work by Blackport et al. 5 , we propose a refined approach to estimate the WACE variance driven by sea ice that can be applied equally to observations and AGCMs. We hypothesize that a better estimate can be obtained from the correlation between the WACE and Barents-Kara sea ice in the preceding month, rather than using the contemporaneous correlation. Lead-lag correlation is a common first step in causal discovery arising from M. Mori et al. Nature Climate Change https://doi.

This climate anomaly is part of a recent trend towards negative values of the NAO index that has occurred over recent winters. The negative trend of the NAO may be related to atmospheric internal variability but it may also be partly forced by slowly varying components of the climate system. In the present study, we investigate the influence of surface conditions on the atmospheric circulation for the 2012–2013 winter using an atmospheric global climate model. In particular, the role of low Arctic sea ice concentration, warm tropical/North Atlantic sea surface temperature and positive Siberian snow cover anomalies are isolated by prescribing them in a set of different numerical experiments. Our simulations suggest that each of these surface forcings favored a negative NAO during the 2012–2013 winter. In our model, the combined NAO response to tropical/North Atlantic SST, Arctic sea ice and Siberian snow anomalies accounts for about 30 % of the observed NAO anomaly. Different physical mechanisms are explored to elucidate the atmospheric responses and are shown to involve both tropical and extratropical processes.},

The main processes by which ice is lost are basal melting, top melting and advection of ice out of the Arctic. The first two processes occur in summer, while the latter process is present all year. The sea-ice budgets for individual models are strikingly similar overall in terms of the major processes causing ice growth and loss, and in terms of the time of year during which each process is important. However, there are also some key differences between the models. The relative amounts of frazil and basal ice 35 formation varies between the models. This is, to some extent at least, attributable to exactly how the frazil growth is formulated within each model. There are also differences in the relative amounts of top and basal melting. As the ice cover and mass decline during the 21 st century, we see a shift in the timing of the top and basal melting in the multi-model mean, with more melt occurring earlier in the year, and less melt later in the summer.

   abstract = {<p>Abstract. A better understanding of the role of sea ice for the changing climate of our planet is the central aim of the diagnostic Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6)-endorsed Sea-Ice Model Intercomparison Project (SIMIP). To reach this aim, SIMIP requests sea-ice-related variables from climate-model simulations that allow for a better understanding and, ultimately, improvement of biases and errors in sea-ice simulations with large-scale climate models. This then allows us to better understand to what degree CMIP6 model simulations relate to reality, thus improving our confidence in answering sea-ice-related questions based on these simulations. Furthermore, the SIMIP protocol provides a standard for sea-ice model output that will streamline and hence simplify the analysis of the simulated sea-ice evolution in research projects independent of CMIP. To reach its aims, SIMIP provides a structured list of model output that allows for an examination of the three main budgets that govern the evolution of sea ice, namely the heat budget, the momentum budget, and the mass budget. In this contribution, we explain the aims of SIMIP in more detail and outline how its design allows us to answer some of the most pressing questions that sea ice still poses to the international climate-research community.</p>},

Advances in remote sensing of sea ice over the past two decades have resulted in a wide variety of satellite-derived sea ice thickness data products becoming publicly available. Selecting the most appropriate product is challenging given end user objectives range from incorporating satellite-derived thickness information in operational activities, including sea ice forecasting, routing of maritime traffic and search and rescue, to climate change analysis, longer-term modelling, prediction and future planning. Depending on the use case, selecting the most suitable satellite data product can depend on the region of interest, data latency, and whether the data are provided routinely, for example via a climate or maritime service provider. Here we examine a suite of current sea ice thickness data products, collating key details of primary interest to end users. We assess 8 years of sea ice thickness observations derived from sensors on board the CryoSat-2 (CS2), Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellites. We evaluate the satellite-only observations with independent ice draft and thickness measurements obtained from the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project (BGEP) upward looking sonar (ULS) instruments and Operation IceBridge (OIB), respectively. We find a number of key differences among data products but find that products utilizing CS2-only measurements are reliable for sea ice thickness, particularly between ∼0.5 and 4 m. Among data compared, a blended CS2-SMOS product was the most reliable for thin ice. Ice thickness distributions at the end of winter appeared realistic when compared with independent ice draft measurements, with the exception of those derived from AVHRR. There is disagreement among the products in terms of the magnitude of the mean thickness trends, especially in spring 2017. Regional comparisons reveal noticeable differences in ice thickness between products, particularly in the marginal seas in areas of considerable ship traffic.]]></p>},

The experimental protocol permits separating Arctic SIDV from internal variability and variability driven by other forcings including sea surface temperature and greenhouse gases. The geographic pattern of SIDV is consistent across seven participating models, but its magnitude strongly depends on ensemble size. Based on 130 members, winter SIDV is ~0.18 hPa2 for Arctic-averaged sea level pressure (~1.5% of the total variance), and ~0.35 K2 for surface air temperature (~21%) at interannual and longer timescales. The results suggest that more than 100 (40) members are needed to separate Arctic SIDV from other components for dynamical (thermodynamical) variables, and insufficient ensemble size always leads to overestimation of SIDV. Nevertheless, SIDV is 0.75–1.5 times as large as the variability driven by other forcings over northern Eurasia and Arctic.},

It is shown that anomalous sea ice conditions accounted for virtually all of the estimated Arctic amplification in surface-based warming over the Arctic Ocean, and furthermore they accounted for a large fraction of Arctic amplification occurring over the high-latitude land between 60N and the Arctic Ocean. Sea ice loss did not appreciably contribute to observed 2007 land temperature warmth equatorward of 60N. Likewise, the observed warming of the free atmosphere attributable to sea ice loss is confined to Arctic latitudes, and is vertically confined to the lowest 1000 m. The results further highlight a strong seasonality of the temperature response to the 2007 sea ice loss. A weak signal of Arctic amplification in surface based warming is found during boreal summer, whereas a dramatically stronger signal is shown to develop during early autumn that persisted through December even as sea ice coverage approached its climatological values in response to the polar night.},

   abstract = {Polar amplification of surface warming has previously been displayed by one of the authors in a simplified climate system model with no ice-albedo feedbacks. A physical mechanism responsible for this pattern is presented and tested in an energy balance model and two different GCMs through a series of fixed-SST and "ghost forcing" experiments. In the first ghost forcing experiment, 4 W/m2 is added uniformly to the mixed layer heat budget and in the second and third, the same forcing is confined to the tropics and extra-tropics, respectively. The result of the uniform forcing is a polar amplified response much like that resulting from a doubling of CO2. Due to an observed linearity this response can be interpreted as the sum of the essentially uniform response to the tropical-only forcing and a more localized response to the extra-tropical-only forcing. The flat response to the tropical forcing comes about due to increased meridional heat transports leading to a warming and moistening of the high-latitude atmosphere. This produces a longwave forcing on the high-latitude surface budget which also has been observed by other investigators. Moreover, the tropical surface budget is found to be more sensitive to SST changes than the extra-tropical surface budget. This strengthens the tendency for the above mechanism to produce polar amplification, since the tropics need to warm less to counter an imposed forcing. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

The model consists of 1) a general circulation model of the atmosphere, 2) a heat and water balance model of the continents, and 3) a simple mixed layer model of the oceans. It is found that the warming of the model atmosphere resulting from the CO2 increase has significant seasonal and latitudinal variation. The warming of the model atmosphere results in an enrichment of the moisture content in the air and an increase in the poleward moisture transport. The additional moisture is picked up from the tropical ocean and is brought to high latitudes where both precipitation and runoff increase throughout the yr. Further, the time of rapid snowmelt and maximum runoff becomes earlier. -from Authors},

In particular, the magnitude, spatial distribution, and seasonality of the surface warming in the Arctic is examined and compared among the models. The range of simulated polar warming in the Arctic is from 1.5 to 4.5 times the global mean warming. While ice-albedo feedback is likely to account for much of the polar amplification, the strength of the feedback depends on numerous physical processes and parametrizations which differ considerably among the models. Nonetheless, the mean sea-ice state in the control (or present) climate is found to influence both the magnitude and spatial distribution of the high-latitude warming in the models. In particular, the latitude of the maximum warming is correlated inversely and significantly with sea-ice extent in the control climate. Additionally, models with relatively thin Arctic ice cover in the control climate tend to have higher polar amplification. An intercomparison of model results also shows that increases in poleward ocean heat transport at high latitudes and increases in polar cloud cover are significantly correlated to amplified Arctic warming. This suggests that these changes in the climate state may modify polar amplification. No significant correlation is found between polar amplification and the control climate continental ice and snow cover.},

   abstract = {One of the major climatic changes apparent over the Arctic Ocean has been the amplified rate at which air temperature has been increasing relative to the global mean. There are multiple factors which play roles in this amplification, including changes in sea ice/albedo, atmospheric circulation, clouds, and water vapor. We investigate the positive feedback on temperature caused by increasing downward longwave radiation flux (DLF) associated with increasing atmospheric precipitable water (PW). The Japanese 25-year Reanalysis and ERA-Interim reanalysis are used to examine the role of the DLF/PW component of the water vapor feedback loop on the enhanced warming in the Arctic between 1979 and 2011. We find a nonlinear relationship between DLF and PW, which suggests that the sensitivity of DLF to changes in PW varies by season, with the highest in winter and the lowest in summer. The positive trends in DLF and PW are widespread over the Arctic during autumn and spring but are centered mainly over the Atlantic sector in winter. The strength of the PW feedback loop depends on both the sensitivity of DLF to changes in PW and the change in PW during 1979-2011. If, in the future, PW were to increase significantly during winter in the central and Pacific sectors of the Arctic, there could be an expansion of Arctic amplification during winter. We also examine the effect of changes in cloud cover and find that such changes account for a much smaller proportion of the changes in DLF than does PW.

Taken together, clouds appear to not affect the fingerprints of Arctic warming. Yet, the magnitude of warming depends strongly on the representation of clouds. Can we check the models?

While increases in greenhouse gases are believed to be the underlying cause of the melting, interactions among the Arctic's changing thermodynamic and dynamic processes driving ice loss are poorly understood. The emission of infrared radiation from the atmosphere to the surface has been recently implicated as an important factor governing the extent of summer perennial sea ice. In this study we use new satellite-derived products to investigate which atmospheric parameters are contributing to observed increases in the downwelling flux in longwave radiation (DLF) during spring in six regions around the periphery of the Arctic Ocean. In areas dominated by low clouds containing liquid water, we find that DLF trends are driven primarily by increasing cloud fraction and more abundant water vapor, and offset by lowering cloud-base heights. In ice-cloud dominated regions (seas north of Siberia), we find that changing water vapor assumes a more important role, while effects of changing cloud fraction and cloud-base height are reduced.

The emergence of observed temperature changes over both land and ocean is clearest in tropical regions, in contrast to the regions of largest change which are in the northern extratropics—broadly consistent with climate model simulations.

Here we present a methodology for estimating ToE for individual climate models, and use it to make maps of ToE for surface air temperature (SAT) based on the CMIP3 global climate models. Consistent with previous studies we show that the median ToE occurs several decades sooner in low latitudes, particularly in boreal summer, than in mid-latitudes. We also show that the median ToE in the Arctic occurs sooner in boreal winter than in boreal summer. A key new aspect of our study is that we quantify the uncertainty in ToE that arises not only from inter-model differences in the magnitude of the climate change signal, but also from large differences in the simulation of natural climate variability. The uncertainty in ToE is at least 30 years in the regions examined, and as much as 60 years in some regions. Alternative emissions scenarios lead to changes in both the median ToE (by a decade or more) and its uncertainty. The SRES B1 scenario is associated with a very large uncertainty in ToE in some regions. Our findings have important implications for climate modelling and climate policy which we discuss.

   abstract = {Partitioning uncertainty in projections of future climate change into contributions from internal variability, model response uncertainty, and emissions scenarios has historically relied on making assumptions about forced changes in the mean and variability. With the advent of multiple Single-Model Initial-Condition Large Ensembles (SMILEs), these assumptions can be scrutinized, as they allow a more robust separation between sources of uncertainty. Here, the iconic framework from Hawkins and Sutton (2009) for uncertainty partitioning is revisited for temperature and precipitation projections using seven SMILEs and the Climate Model Intercomparison Projects CMIP5 and CMIP6 archives. The original approach is shown to work well at global scales (potential method error <20%), while at local to regional scales such as British Isles temperature or Sahel precipitation, there is a notable potential method error (up to 50%) and more accurate partitioning of uncertainty is achieved through the use of SMILEs. Whenever internal variability and forced changes therein are important, the need to evaluate and improve the representation of variability in models is evident. The available SMILEs are shown to be a good representation of the CMIP5 model diversity in many situations, making them a useful tool for interpreting CMIP5. CMIP6 often shows larger absolute and relative model uncertainty than CMIP5, although part of this difference can be reconciled with the higher average transient climate response in CMIP6. This study demonstrates the added value of a collection of SMILEs for quantifying and diagnosing uncertainty in climate projections.},

The pace of Arctic warming is two-to-three times that of the globe; this disparity reached a new record high during 2016. While the Arctic spans only a small fraction of the Earth, it plays a disproportionate and multifaceted role in the climate system. In this article, we offer new perspectives on ways in which the Arctic's rapid warming may influence weather patterns in heavily populated regions (the mid-latitudes) of the Northern Hemisphere. Research on this topic has evolved almost as rapidly as the snow and ice have diminished, and while much has been learned, many questions remain. The atmosphere is complex, highly variable, and undergoing a multitude of simultaneous changes, many of which have become apparent only recently. These realities present challenges to robust signal detection and to clear attribution of cause-and-effect. In addition to updating the state of this science, we propose an explanation for the varying and intermittent response of mid-latitude circulation to the rapidly warming Arctic.

   abstract = {The Arctic has warmed more than twice as fast as the global average since the mid 20th century, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification (AA). These profound changes to the Arctic system have coincided with a period of ostensibly more frequent events of extreme weather across the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes, including extreme heat and rainfall events and recent severe winters. Though winter temperatures have generally warmed since 1960 over mid-to-high latitudes, the acceleration in the rate of warming at high-latitudes, relative to the rest of the NH, started approximately in 1990. Trends since 1990 show cooling over the NH continents, especially in Northern Eurasia. The possible link between Arctic change and mid-latitude climate and weather has spurred a rush of new observational and modeling studies. A number of workshops held during 2013-2014 have helped frame the problem and have called for continuing and enhancing efforts for improving our understanding of Arctic-mid-latitude linkages and its attribution to the occurrence of extreme climate and weather events. Although these workshops have outlined some of the major challenges and provided broad recommendations, further efforts are needed to synthesize the diversified research results to identify where community consensus and gaps exist. Building upon findings and recommendations of the previous workshops, the US CLIVAR Working Group on Arctic Change and Possible Influence on Mid-latitude Climate and Weather convened an international workshop at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, on February 1-3, 2017. Experts in the fields of atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere sciences assembled to assess the rapidly evolving state of understanding, identify consensus on knowledge and gaps in research, and develop specific actions to accelerate progress within the research community. With more than 100 participants, the workshop was the largest and most comprehensive gathering of climate scientists to address the topic to date. In this white paper, we synthesize and discuss outcomes from this workshop and activities involving many of the working group members.},

   abstract = {Accelerated warming in the Arctic, as compared to the rest of the globe, might have profound impacts on mid-latitude weather. Most studies analyzing Arctic links to mid-latitude weather focused on winter, yet recent summers have seen strong reductions in sea-ice extent and snow cover, a weakened equator-to-pole thermal gradient and associated weakening of the mid-latitude circulation. We review the scientific evidence behind three leading hypotheses on the influence of Arctic changes on mid-latitude summer weather: Weakened storm tracks, shifted jet streams, and amplified quasi-stationary waves. We show that interactions between Arctic teleconnections and other remote and regional feedback processes could lead to more persistent hot-dry extremes in the mid-latitudes. The exact nature of these non-linear interactions is not well quantified but they provide potential high-impact risks for society.},

   abstract = {This paper aims to understand the physical processes causing the large spread in the storm track projections of the CMIP5 climate models. In particular, the relationship between the climate change responses of the storm tracks, as measured by the 2-6 day mean sea level pressure variance, and the equator-to-pole temperature differences at upper- and lower-tropospheric levels is investigated. In the southern hemisphere the responses of the upper- and lower-tropospheric temperature differences are correlated across the models and as a result they share similar associations with the storm track responses. There are large regions in which the storm track responses are correlated with the temperature difference responses, and a simple linear regression model based on the temperature differences at either level captures the spatial pattern of the mean storm track response as well explaining between 30 and 60 % of the inter-model variance of the storm track responses. In the northern hemisphere the responses of the two temperature differences are not significantly correlated and their associations with the storm track responses are more complicated. In summer, the responses of the lower-tropospheric temperature differences dominate the inter-model spread of the storm track responses. In winter, the responses of the upper- and lower-temperature differences both play a role. The results suggest that there is potential to reduce the spread in storm track responses by constraining the relative magnitudes of the warming in the tropical and polar regions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {Extratropical cyclones are storm systems that are observed to travel preferentially within confined regions known as storm tracks. They contribute to precipitation, wind and temperature extremes in mid-latitudes. Cyclones tend to form where surface temperature gradients are large, and the jet stream influences their speed and direction of travel. Storm tracks shape the global climate through transport of energy and momentum. The intensity and location of storm tracks varies seasonally, and in response to other natural variations, such as changes in tropical sea surface temperature. A hierarchy of numerical models of the atmosphere-ocean system-from highly idealized to comprehensive-has been used to study and predict responses of storm tracks to anthropogenic climate change. The future position and intensity of storm tracks depend on processes that alter temperature gradients. However, different processes can have opposing influences on temperature gradients, which leads to a tug of war on storm track responses and makes future projections more difficult. For example, as climate warms, surface shortwave cloud radiative changes increase the Equator-To-pole temperature gradient, but at the same time, longwave cloud radiative changes reduce this gradient. Future progress depends on understanding and accurately quantifying the relative influence of such processes on the storm tracks.},

   abstract = {The evidence for anthropogenic climate change continues to strengthen, and concerns about severe weather events are increasing. As a result, scientific interest is rapidly shifting from detection and attribution of global climate change to prediction of its impacts at the regional scale. However, nearly everything we have any confidence in when it comes to climate change is related to global patterns of surface temperature, which are primarily controlled by thermodynamics. In contrast, we have much less confidence in atmospheric circulation aspects of climate change, which are primarily controlled by dynamics and exert a strong control on regional climate. Model projections of circulation-related fields, including precipitation, show a wide range of possible outcomes, even on centennial timescales. Sources of uncertainty include low-frequency chaotic variability and the sensitivity to model error of the circulation response to climate forcing. As the circulation response to external forcing appears to project strongly onto existing patterns of variability, knowledge of errors in the dynamics of variability may provide some constraints on model projections. Nevertheless, higher scientific confidence in circulation-related aspects of climate change will be difficult to obtain. For effective decision-making, it is necessary to move to a more explicitly probabilistic, risk-based approach.},

   abstract = {The influence of realistic Arctic sea ice anomalies on the atmosphere during winter is investigated with version 3.6 of the Community Climate Model (CCM3.6). Model experiments are performed for the winters with the most (1982/83) and least (1995/96) Arctic ice coverage during 1979-99, when ice concentration estimates were available from satellites. The experiments consist of 50-member ensembles: using large ensembles proved critical to distinguish the signal from noise. The local response to ice anomalies over the subpolar seas of both the Atlantic and Pacific is robust and generally shallow with large upward surface heat fluxes (>100 W m-2), near-surface warming, enhanced precipitation, and below-normal sea level pressure where sea ice receded, and the reverse where the ice expanded. The large-scale response to reduced (enhanced) ice extent to the east (west) of Greenland during 1982/83 resembles the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) with a ridge over the poles and a trough at midlatitudes. The large-scale response was distinctly different in the Pacific, where ice extent anomalies in the Sea of Okhotsk generate a wave train that extends downstream over North America but the wave train response is greatly diminished when the model is driven by ice concentration rather than ice extent anomalies. Comparing the AGCM response to observations suggests that the feedback of the ice upon the atmospheric circulation is positive (negative) in the Pacific (Atlantic) sector. The magnitude of the wintertime response to ice extent anomalies is modest, on the order of 20 m at 500 mb. However, the 500-mb height anomalies roughly double in strength over much of the Arctic when forced by ice concetration anomalies. Furthermore, the NAO-like response increases linearly with the aerial extent of the Atlantic ice anomalies and thus could be quite large if the ice edge retreats as a result of global warming. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to explore the sensitivity of the large-scale atmospheric energy and moisture budgets to prescribed changes in Arctic sea ice and sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Observed sea ice fractions and SSTs from 1996 and 2007, representing years of high and low sea ice extent, are used as lower boundary conditions. A pan-Arctic domain extending into the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is used. ERA-Interim reanalysis data from 1994 to 2008 are employed as initial and lateral forcing data for each high and low sea ice simulation. The addition of a third ensemble, with a mixed SST field between years 1996 and 2007 (using 2007 SSTs above 66N and 1996 values below), results in a total of three 15-member ensembles. Results of the simulations show both local and remote responses to reduced sea ice. The local polar cap averaged response is largest in October and November, dominated by increased turbulent heat fluxes resulting in vertically deep heating and moistening of the Arctic atmosphere. This warmer and moister atmosphere is associated with an increase in cloud cover, affecting the surface and atmospheric energy budgets. There is an enhancement of the hydrologic cycle, with increased evaporation in areas of sea ice loss paired with increased precipitation. Most of the Arctic climate response results from within-Arctic changes, although some changes in the hydrologic cycle reflect circulation responses to midlatitude SST forcing, highlighting the general sensitivity of the Arctic climate. © 2012 American Geophysical Union.

   abstract = {An atmospheric general circulation model driven with the observed 2007 extreme Arctic sea surface temperatures and sea ice concentrations responds with higher surface air temperature over northern Siberia and the Eastern Arctic Ocean (+3 K), increased heat uptake of the ocean in summer (+40 W m <sup>-2</sup>) and increased oceanic heat losses in fall (-60 W m<sup>-2</sup>) compared to a climatological scenario. A pronounced low sea level pressure anomaly over the Eastern Arctic (-200 Pa) reinforces a sea level pressure dipole over the Arctic that has been observed to become an increasingly important feature of the Arctic atmospheric circulation in summer. The anomalous pressure distribution contributes to sea ice transport from the Eastern Arctic and is likely to reinforce the original sea ice extent anomaly. The results thus support assessments of observational data over recent years that sea ice loss may feed back onto the atmospheric circulation in the northern hemisphere. The resulting late summer/early fall (JAS) atmospheric anomalies are very robust, they appear in virtually all of the 40 realizations of the experiment. However, we find no significant continuation of the atmospheric signal into the winter as has been suggested based on atmospheric observational data.

   abstract = {There is an observed relationship linking Arctic sea ice conditions in autumn to midlatitude weather the following winter. Of interest in this study is a hypothesized stratospheric pathway whereby reduced sea ice in the Barents-Kara Seas enhances upward wave activity and wave-breaking in the stratosphere, leading to a weakening of the polar vortex and a transition of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to its negative phase. A Causal Effect Networks (CEN) framework is used to explore the stratospheric pathway between late autumn Barents-Kara sea ice and the February NAO, focusing on its seasonal 5 evolution, timescale-dependence, and robustness. Results indicate that the pathway is statistically detectable and has been relatively "active" over the 39-year observational period used here, explaining approximately 26% of the interannual variability in the February NAO. However, a bootstrap-based resampling test reveals that the pathway is highly intermittent: the full strato-spheric pathway appears in only 15% of the sample populations derived from observations, with individual causal linkages ranging from 44 to 85% in occurrence rates. The pathway's intermittency is consistent with the weak signal-to-noise ratio of 10 the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice variability in modelling experiments, and suggests that Arctic-midlatitude telecon-nections might be favoured in certain background states. On shorter time scales, the CEN detects two-way interactions between Barents-Kara sea ice and the midlatitude circulation that indicate a role for synoptic variability associated with blocking over the Urals region and moist air intrusions from the Euro-Atlantic sector. This synoptic variability has the potential to interfere with the stratospheric pathway, thereby contributing to its intermittency. This study helps quantify the robustness of causal 15 linkages within the stratospheric pathway, and provides insight into which linkages are most subject to sampling issues within the relatively short observational record. Overall, the results should help guide the analysis and design of ensemble modelling experiments required to improve physical understanding of Arctic-midlatitude teleconnections.},

The ice cover is also thinning. Downward trends in extent and thickness have been accompanied by pronounced interannual and multiyear variability, forced by both the atmosphere and ocean. As the ice thins, its response to atmospheric and oceanic forcing may be changing. In support of a busier Arctic, there is a growing need to predict ice conditions on a variety of time and space scales. A major challenge to providing seasonal scale predictions is the 7–10 days limit of numerical weather prediction. While a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean is likely well within this century, there is much uncertainty in the timing. This reflects differences in climate model structure, the unknown evolution of anthropogenic forcing, and natural climate variability. In sharp contrast to the Arctic, Antarctic sea ice extent, while highly variable, has increased slightly over the period of satellite observations. The reasons for this different behavior remain to be resolved, but responses to changing atmospheric circulation patterns appear to play a strong role.},

The majority of models have too small of an SIE at the minimum in February, while several of the models have less than two-thirds of the observed SIE at the September maximum.

The models have very large differences in SIE over 1860–2005. Most of the control runs have statistically significant trends in SIE over their full time span, and all of the models have a negative trend in SIE since the mid-nineteenth century. The negative SIE trends in most of the model runs over 1979–2005 are a continuation of an earlier decline, suggesting that the processes responsible for the observed increase over the last 30 years are not being simulated correctly. </p>},

In contrast, it took the Arctic sea ice cover a full 3 decades to register a loss that great in yearly average ice extents.

Four of the 5 sectors into which the Antarctic sea ice cover is divided all also have 40-y positive trends that are well reduced from their 2014–2017 values. The one anomalous sector in this regard, the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas, has a 40-y negative trend, with the yearly average ice extents decreasing overall in the first 3 decades, reaching a minimum in 2007, and exhibiting an overall upward trend since 2007 (i.e., reflecting a reversal in the opposite direction from the other 4 sectors and the Antarctic sea ice cover as a whole).},

Although observations show a more or less continuous decline for the past four or five decades 3,4, there are few long-term records withwhich to assess natural sea ice variability. Until now, the question of whether or not current trends are potentially anomalous 5 has therefore remained unanswerable. Here we use a network of high-resolution terrestrial proxies from the circum-Arctic region to reconstruct past extents of summer sea ice, and show that- although extensive uncertainties remain, especially before the sixteenth century-both the duration and magnitude of the current decline in sea ice seem to be unprecedented for the past 1,450 years. Enhanced advection of warm Atlantic water to the Arctic 6 seems to be the main factor driving the decline of sea ice extent on multidecadal timescales, and may result from nonlinear feedbacks between sea ice and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. These results reinforce the assertion that sea ice is an active component of Arctic climate variability and that the recent decrease in summer Arctic sea ice is consistent with anthropogenically forced warming. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

After intercomparing the results and statistical parameters using the ordinary least squares regression (OLSR), the principle component regression (PCR) and the partial least squares regression (PLSR) methods, SIE time series were synthesized into a more robust series using the weighted average method, which used the explained variances as weights. The results showed that from the end of the 13th century to the end of 18th century, the autumn B-K SIE was large, with large variations and a slightly expanding trend overall. This reflected significant multidecadal oscillations under the Little Ice Age (LIA) background. The B-K SIE began to decrease at the end of the 18th century, and a shrinking trend became significant during the second half of the 19th century, which lasted into the 1930s–1940s. The 1930s–1940s was a period with a relatively low SIE in the B-K Sea, and the SIE had a short period of expansion from the 1940s–1970s. However, the B-K SIE has continuously and significantly shrank since the 1970s. The reduction in the B-K SIE since the end of the 18th century has been unprecedented in both duration and speed over the last 700 years. The B-K SIE has retreated significantly since the 1970s, with a speed 6.18 times greater than the former mean retreating speed. The industrial revolution may be a dominant factor in this result.

Current estimates suggest that, for the Arctic as a whole, nearly one-half of the observed loss of summer sea ice cover is not due to anthropogenic forcing but rather is due to internal variability. Using the 40 members of the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), our analysis provides the first regional assessment of the role of internal variability on the observed sea ice loss. The CESM-LE is one of the best available models for such an analysis, because it performs better than other CMIP5 models for many metrics of importance. Our study reveals that the local contribution of internal variability has a large range and strongly depends on the month and region in question. We find that the pattern of internal variability is highly nonuniform over the Arctic, with internal variability accounting for less than 10% of late summer (August–September) East Siberian Sea sea ice loss but more than 60% of the Kara Sea sea ice loss. In contrast, spring (April–May) sea ice loss, notably in the Barents Sea, has so far been dominated by internal variability.</p>},

Modeled late 20th century ice extent loss also cannot be explained by natural causes alone, but the six available CCSM4 ensemble members exhibit a large spread in their late 20th century ice extent loss. Comparing trends from the CCSM4 ensemble to observed trends suggests that internal variability explains approximately half of the observed 1979-2005 September Arctic sea ice extent loss. In a warming world, CCSM4 shows that multi-decadal negative trends increase in frequency and magnitude, and that trend variability on 2-10 year timescales increases. Furthermore, when internal variability counteracts anthropogenic forcing, positive trends on 2-20 year timescales occur until the middle of the 21st century.

   abstract = {The relative contribution and physical drivers of internal variability in recent Arctic sea ice loss remain open questions, leaving up for debate whether global climate models used for climate projection lack sufficient sensitivity in the Arctic to climate forcing. Here, through analysis of large ensembles of fully coupled climate model simulations with historical radiative forcing, we present an important internal mechanism arising from low-frequency Arctic atmospheric variability in models that can cause substantial summer sea ice melting in addition to that due to anthropogenic forcing. This simulated internal variability shows a strong similarity to the observed Arctic atmospheric change in the past 37 years. Through a fingerprint pattern matching method, we estimate that this internal variability contributes to about 40–50% of observed multi-decadal decline in Arctic sea ice. Our study also suggests that global climate models may not actually underestimate sea ice sensitivities in the Arctic, but have trouble fully replicating an observed linkage between the Arctic and lower latitudes in recent decades. Further improvements in simulating the observed Arctic–global linkage are thus necessary before the Arctic’s sensitivity to global warming in models can be quantified with confidence.},

The net melt area of 490 × 10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>2</sup> between 2005 and 2008 accounts for nearly 32% of the net loss of 1.54 × 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup> of Arctic Ocean MYI coverage over the same period.

Because climate-model simulations of the sea-ice loss differ substantially, we used a robust linear relationship between monthly-mean September sea-ice area and cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to infer the future evolution of Arctic summer sea ice directly from the observational record. The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 square meters of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO2 emission. On the basis of this sensitivity, Arctic sea ice will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 gigatons of CO2 emissions. Most models show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the modeled increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the modeled transient climate response.},

Although there is some sensitivity to details in the constraining method, the observationally constrained projections suggest that the benefits of going from 2.0 °C to 1.5 °C stabilized warming are substantial; an eightfold decrease in the frequency of ice-free conditions is expected, from once in every five to once in every forty years.

However, it is largely unknown how Arctic summer sea-ice impacts would vary under the 1.5 °C Paris target compared to scenarios with greater warming.

It also reduces the late-century probability of an ice cover below the 2012 record minimum from 98% to 55%. For warming above 2 °C, frequent ice-free conditions can be expected, potentially for several months per year. Although sea-ice loss is generally reversible for decreasing temperatures, sea ice will only recover to current conditions if atmospheric CO2 is reduced below present-day concentrations. Due to model biases, these results provide a lower bound on summer sea-ice impacts, but clearly demonstrate the benefits of constraining warming to 1.5 °C.},

Arctic sea ice area shows large interannual variability due to the numerous factors, but on longer time scales the total sea ice area is approximately linearly related to Arctic surface air temperature in models and observations. Overall, models however strongly underestimate the recent sea ice decline. Here we show that this can be explained with two interlinked biases. Most climate models simulate a smaller sea ice area reduction per degree local surface warming. Arctic polar amplification, the ratio between Arctic and global temperature, is also underestimated but a number of models are within the uncertainty estimated from natural variability. A recalibration of an ensemble of global climate models using observations over 28years provides a scenario independent relationship and yields about 2°C change in annual mean global surface temperature above present as the most likely global temperature threshold for September sea ice to disappear, but with substantial associated uncertainty.

   abstract = {Satellite observations show that the Arctic sea ice melt season is getting longer. This lengthening has important implications for the Arctic Ocean's radiation budget, marine ecology and accessibility. Here we assess how passive microwave satellite observations of the melt season can be used for climate model evaluation. By using the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM LE), we evaluate the effect of multiple possible definitions of melt onset, freeze onset and melt season length on comparisons with passive microwave satellite data, while taking into account the impacts of internal variability. We find that within the CESM LE, melt onset shows a higher sensitivity to definition choices than freeze onset, while freeze onset is more greatly impacted by internal variability. The CESM LE accurately simulates that the trend in freeze onset largely drives the observed pan-Arctic trend in melt season length. Under RCP8.5 forcing, the CESM LE projects that freeze onset dates will continue to shift later, leading to a pan-Arctic average melt season length of 7-9 months by the end of the 21st century. However, none of the available model definitions produce trends in the pan-Arctic melt season length as large as seen in passive microwave observations. This suggests a model bias, which might be a factor in the generally underestimated response of sea ice loss to global warming in the CESM LE. Overall, our results show that the choice of model melt season definition is highly dependent on the question posed, and none of the definitions exactly match the physics underlying the passive microwave observations.},

While melt onset trends are generally smaller, the timing of melt onset has a large influence on the total amount of solar energy absorbed during summer.

Cumulative anomalies in total absorbed solar radiation from May through September for the most recent pentad locally exceed 300-400 MJ m-2 in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and East Siberian seas.

   abstract = {With amplified warming and record sea ice loss, the Arctic is the canary of global warming. The historical Arctic warming is poorly understood, limiting our confidence in model projections. Specifically, Arctic surface air temperature increased rapidly over the early 20th century, at rates comparable to those of recent decades despite much weaker greenhouse gas forcing. Here, we show that the concurrent phase shift of Pacific and Atlantic interdecadal variability modes is the major driver for the rapid early 20thcentury Arctic warming. Atmospheric model simulations successfully reproduce the early Arctic warming when the interdecadal variability of sea surface temperature (SST) is properly prescribed. The early 20th-century Arctic warming is associated with positive SST anomalies over the tropical and North Atlantic and a Pacific SST pattern reminiscent of the positive phase of the Pacific decadal oscillation. Atmospheric circulation changes are important for the early 20th-century Arctic warming. The equatorial Pacific warming deepens the Aleutian low, advecting warm air into the North American Arctic. The extratropical North Atlantic and North Pacific SST warming strengthens surface westerly winds over northern Eurasia, intensifying the warming there. Coupled ocean-Atmosphere simulations support the constructive intensification of Arctic warming by a concurrent, negative-To-positive phase shift of the Pacific and Atlantic interdecadal modes. Our results aid attributing the historical Arctic warming and thereby constrain the amplified warming projected for this important region.},

   abstract = {<p><![CDATA[Abstract. The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is quasi-periodic oscillation of the tropical zonal wind in the stratosphere. When the tropical lower stratospheric wind is easterly (westerly), the winter Northern Hemisphere (NH) stratospheric polar vortex tends to be weak (strong). This relation is known as the Holton–Tan relationship. Several mechanisms for this relationship have been proposed, especially linking the tropics with high latitudes through stratospheric pathway. Although QBO impacts on the troposphere have been extensively discussed, a tropospheric pathway of the Holton–Tan relationship has not been explored previously. Here, we propose a tropospheric pathway of the QBO impact, which may partly account for the Holton–Tan relationship in early winter, especially in the November–December period. The study is based on analyses of observational data and results from a simple linear model and atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations. The mechanism is summarized as follows: the easterly phase of the QBO is accompanied with colder temperature in the tropical tropopause layer, which enhances convective activity over the tropical western Pacific and suppresses it over the Indian Ocean, thus enhancing the Walker circulation. This convection anomaly generates a Rossby wave train, propagating into the midlatitude troposphere, which constructively interferences with the climatological stationary waves, especially in wavenumber 1, resulting in enhanced upward propagation of the planetary wave and a weakened polar vortex.]]></p>},

In recognition, we conduct a systematic investigation of how sea-ice concentration (SIC) changes with cyclone passage, including all individual storms that pass over any part of the region's ice pack. For all seasons, especially summer and autumn, we find a pattern of higher ice concentration after a region is influenced by a cyclone compared to when it is not, primarily due to thermodynamic effects. During warm months, cyclones appear to slow the general day-to-day decline in concentration; in cold months, cyclones augment the day-to-day increase. These relationships are changing over time, with cyclone-associated concentration changes becoming less distinct from overall changes. Cyclone effects on ice divergence are spatially variable; computed fields are noisy. In summer, these dynamic effects of cyclone passage generally decrease SIC, but are outweighed by the thermodynamic effects (e.g., reductions in air temperature, shortwave radiation). In autumn, cyclone-associated concentration changes are not as easily explained by observed cyclone conditions. Key questions remain regarding the extent to which our findings are influenced by artifacts of surface melt and weather effects on the passive microwave retrievals.</p>},

Here, using hydrographic observations from 1971 to 2018, we show that the Barents Sea climate system has reached a point where ‘the Barents Sea cooling machine’—warmer Atlantic inflow, less sea ice, more regional ocean heat loss—has changed towards less-efficient cooling. Present change is dominated by reduced ocean heat loss over the southern Barents Sea as a result of anomalous southerly winds. The outflows have accordingly become warmer. Outflow densities have nevertheless remained relatively unperturbed as increasing salinity appears to have compensated the warming inflow. However, as the upstream Atlantic Water is now observed to freshen while still relatively warm, we speculate that the Barents Sea within a few years may export water masses of record-low density to the adjacent basins and deep ocean circulation. The Barents Sea cools the ocean, and dense water masses form that flow into the global overturning circulation. Hydrographic observations from 1971 to 2018 show reduced cooling efficiency with warmer Atlantic inflow, reduced sea ice and reduced wind-driven heat loss.},

The results show that the average number of days per month on which stratospheric negative NAM signals extend downward into the troposphere is more than twice as large during the easterly phase of the QBO (EQBO) as those during the westerly phase of the QBO (WQBO). The increasing likelihood of downward extension of stratospheric negative NAM signals during the EQBO is related to three factors: enhanced upward wave-1 fluxes entering the stratosphere, anomalous poleward wave fluxes below 100 hPa and EQBO-induced residual circulation. It is also revealed that the EQBO-induced subtropical tropospheric easterly anomalies lead to positive height anomalies over the subtropical North Atlantic, which are amplified by transient eddies and maintained by convection. These subtropical positive height anomalies further stimulate an anomalous wave train, forcing subpolar positive height anomalies over the Euro-Atlantic sector and enhancing wave 1. Over the Pacific, the EQBO could also induce positive height anomalies in the tropical troposphere, and these anomalies are related to convection and vertical motion. The positive height anomalies can induce anomalous poleward-propagating waves, forcing negative height anomalies over the North Pacific at mid-high latitudes and the enhancing wave 1. Fewer stratospheric positive NAM signals extend downward into the troposphere during the EQBO than during the WQBO, with mechanisms similar to those of negative NAM.},

Here we use snowstorms as a marker to assess the mesoscale fingerprint of climate change, providing a description of potential changes in winter weather event occurrence, character and variability in central and eastern North America under a high anthropogenic emissions pathway. Snowstorms are segmented and tracked using high-resolution, snow water equivalent output from dynamically downscaled simulations which, unlike global climate models, can resolve important mesoscale features such as banded snow. Significant decreases are found in the frequency and size of snowstorms in a pseudo-global warming simulation, including those events that produce the most extreme snowfall accumulations. Early and late boreal winter months show particularly robust proportional decreases in snowstorms and snow water equivalent accumulations. Predicting the impact of climate change on snowstorms is key for future water resource estimates. North American snowstorms are tracked in high-resolution warming simulations and exhibit robust decreases in storm count, snow water equivalent and areal footprint, particularly in shoulder seasons.},

   abstract = {Historical temperature measurements are the basis of global climate datasets like HadCRUT4. This dataset contains many missing values, particularly for periods before the mid-twentieth century, although recent years are also incomplete. Here we demonstrate that artificial intelligence can skilfully fill these observational gaps when combined with numerical climate model data. We show that recently developed image inpainting techniques perform accurate monthly reconstructions via transfer learning using either 20CR (Twentieth-Century Reanalysis) or the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) experiments. The resulting global annual mean temperature time series exhibit high Pearson correlation coefficients (≥0.9941) and low root mean squared errors (≤0.0547 °C) as compared with the original data. These techniques also provide advantages relative to state-of-the-art kriging interpolation and principal component analysis-based infilling. When applied to HadCRUT4, our method restores a missing spatial pattern of the documented El Niño from July 1877. With respect to the global mean temperature time series, a HadCRUT4 reconstruction by our method points to a cooler nineteenth century, a less apparent hiatus in the twenty-first century, an even warmer 2016 being the warmest year on record and a stronger global trend between 1850 and 2018 relative to previous estimates. We propose image inpainting as an approach to reconstruct missing climate information and thereby reduce uncertainties and biases in climate records. An artificial intelligence-based method may infill gaps in historical temperature data more effectively than conventional techniques. Application of this method reveals a stronger global warming trend between 1850 and 2018 than estimated previously.},

   abstract = {In the early twenty-first century, satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi-model ensemble. Because observations and coupled model simulations do not have the same phasing of natural internal variability, such decadal differences in simulated and observed warming rates invariably occur. Here we analyse global-mean tropospheric temperatures from satellites and climate model simulations to examine whether warming rate differences over the satellite era can be explained by internal climate variability alone. We find that in the last two decades of the twentieth century, differences between modelled and observed tropospheric temperature trends are broadly consistent with internal variability. Over most of the early twenty-first century, however, model tropospheric warming is substantially larger than observed; warming rate differences are generally outside the range of trends arising from internal variability. The probability that multi-decadal internal variability fully explains the asymmetry between the late twentieth and early twenty-first century results is low (between zero and about 9%). It is also unlikely that this asymmetry is due to the combined effects of internal variability and a model error in climate sensitivity. We conclude that model overestimation of tropospheric warming in the early twenty-first century is partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations.},

In this study, deep learning models are compared with standard machine learning approaches on the task of predicting the probability of severe hail based on upper-air dynamic and thermodynamic fields from a convection-allowing numerical weather prediction model. The data for this study come from patches surrounding storms identified in NCAR convection-allowing ensemble runs from 3 May to 3 June 2016. The machine learning models are trained to predict whether the simulated surface hail size from the Thompson hail size diagnostic exceeds 25 mm over the hour following storm detection. A convolutional neural network is compared with logistic regressions using input variables derived from either the spatial means of each field or principal component analysis. The convolutional neural network statistically significantly outperforms all other methods in terms of Brier skill score and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. Interpretation of the convolutional neural network through feature importance and feature optimization reveals that the network synthesized information about the environment and storm morphology that is consistent with our understanding of hail growth, including large lapse rates and a wind shear profile that favors wide updrafts. Different neurons in the network also record different storm modes, and the magnitude of the output of those neurons is used to analyze the spatiotemporal distributions of different storm modes in the NCAR ensemble.},

Using output from the Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project we examine the mean change of the North Pacific wintertime zonal winds, and use cluster analysis to explore the change in sub-seasonal, wintertime variability in zonal winds between experiments with future Arctic sea ice concentrations relative to a pre-industrial run. Further, given the relationship between the North Pacific jet stream and North American weather regimes, we also examine the changes in surface temperature variability over North America. The four climate models investigated here exhibit robust agreement in both sign and structure of the atmospheric responses, with a strengthened wintertime North Pacific jet, an increase in anomalously strong and extended jet events, and a decreased frequency of weakened and equatorward-shifted jet events in response to reduced Arctic sea ice. The models also show changes in wintertime, North American surface temperature patterns that are consistent with the zonal wind changes seen in the North Pacific. There is an increase in the frequency of occurrence of the North American temperature dipole pattern, defined as anomalously warm temperatures in the west or northwest and anomalously cold temperatures in the east or southeast, and a decrease in the frequency of anomalously cold temperatures over North America.},

   abstract = {Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) require sea ice for capturing seals and are expected to decline range-wide as global warming and sea-ice loss continue 1,2. Estimating when different subpopulations will likely begin to decline has not been possible to date because data linking ice availability to demographic performance are unavailable for most sub-populations 2 and unobtainable a priori for the projected but yet-to-be-observed low ice extremes 3. Here, we establish the likely nature, timing and order of future demographic impacts by estimating the threshold numbers of days that polar bears can fast before cub recruitment and/or adult survival are impacted and decline rapidly. Intersecting these fasting impact thresholds with projected numbers of ice-free days, estimated from a large ensemble of an Earth system model 4 , reveals when demographic impacts will likely occur in different subpopulations across the Arctic. Our model captures demographic trends observed during 1979-2016, showing that recruitment and survival impact thresholds may already have been exceeded in some subpopulations. It also suggests that, with high greenhouse gas emissions, steeply declining reproduction and survival will jeopardize the persistence of all but a few high-Arctic subpopulations by 2100. Moderate emissions mitigation prolongs persistence but is unlikely to prevent some subpopulation extirpations within this century. Polar bears occur in 19 subpopulations across four arctic ecore-gions 1,2 (Fig. 1). In the southernmost ecoregion (that is, the Seasonal Ice Ecoregion (SIE)), complete sea-ice melt forces bears ashore each summer 1,2 , where they rely on body energy reserves for survival and lactation due to the absence of energetically adequate food 5. Prolonged ice absence from productive continental shelf waters now also forces increasingly long fasts in parts of the other ecore-gions (that is, the Divergent Ice Ecoregion (DIE), Convergent Ice Ecoregion (CIE) and Archipelago Ecoregion (AE)) 6-areas where bears historically continued foraging on perennial ice through summer 1. Although polar bears can fast for months, limits are imposed by the amount of energy bears can store in body reserves before periods of food deprivation 3,5,7. Lengthening fasts have already lowered body condition, reproduction, survival and abundance in some SIE and DIE subpopulations 8-13 , and similar trends are expected throughout the Arctic as ice loss continues 1,2. However, it remains unclear how long bears can fast before substantial declines in lacta-tion (and therefore cub recruitment) and/or adult survival occur. Information on when such fasting thresholds might be exceeded in different subpopulations, or how rapidly demographic rates would decline following threshold exceedance, is also lacking. Estimating timelines for the anticipated declines is challenging because data quantifying sea ice-demography relationships are lacking in most subpopulations 2. Indeed, even in the best-studied subpopulations, abundance projections currently rely on extremely limited data (for example, in the Southern Beaufort Sea, where projections used a threshold of 127 ice-free days to distinguish between good and bad years, based on only 5 years of demographic data 14). Moreover, today's sea-ice conditions differ substantially from anticipated low ice extremes, thus precluding empirical measurements of how reproduction and survival will change before these changes occur 3. Previous projections for the future range and abundance of polar bears attempted to overcome such data gaps with expert judgement 1 and/or extrapolations from a few well-studied subpopu-lations 2 , and consequently could only offer limited spatial and temporal forecast resolution with large uncertainties. Timelines for declining survival and recruitment can be projected , however, even in subpopulations where demographic information is absent, by calculating the energetic needs of fasting polar bears and estimating when longer fasts will preclude meeting those needs 3,15. Molnár et al. used such energy budget calculations to estimate the likely magnitude of future litter size 15 and adult male survival declines 3 in the Western Hudson Bay subpopulation, but other projections 16,17 incorrectly applied the estimates of Molnár et al., assuming, for example, a universal 180-d persistence threshold , without performing the necessary energy budget calculations, model tests or uncertainty analyses, to justify this choice and/or extrapolations beyond the Western Hudson Bay subpopulation. Here, we describe dynamic energy budget (DEB) estimates of fasting thresholds that limit offspring recruitment and adult survival. We test whether our estimated thresholds capture reported demographic changes in subpopulations where observations are available , project likely timelines for recruitment and survival declines in all SIE, DIE and CIE subpopulations (~80% of Earth's polar bears; Fig. 1) and evaluate the uncertainty surrounding these timelines. The impacts of fasting on recruitment and survival depend on: the energy reserves of bears at fast initiation; their energy expenditures while fasting; and fast duration. We established base-lines for each of these with measurements from bears that were already forced to fast annually for extended periods in the Western Hudson Bay subpopulation (SIE; Fig. 1), and applied sensitivity analyses to these baselines to assess associated uncertainties and},

   abstract = {T he Arctic is currently warming on average more than twice the global mean, with some regions experiencing even higher rates. Additionally, sea-ice extent is decreasing in all months, which is accompanied by significant sea-ice thinning 1-4. This ongoing change has both local and remote impacts on the climate system, influencing the local surface energy budget as well as large-scale ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns 5-14 and ecosystems 15,16. Is the speed of recent observed Arctic change unprecedented? How do these trends compare with the most pronounced abrupt changes recorded in the palaeoclimate record? Are there similarities between current and past changes in terms of triggering mechanisms? We present answers to these questions by comparing ongoing and projected change with examples of abrupt changes recorded in Greenland ice cores. Estimated current rates of change and the spatial patterns of trends in ongoing Arctic warming can be obtained by analysing ERA-Interim reanalysis data 17. Annual mean temperature trends over the Arctic during the past 40 years show that over this period, where satellite data are available, major portions have warmed by more than 1 °C per decade (Fig. 1a, red colours and outlined portion ; a warming of 4 °C within 40 years is hereafter referred to as 1 °C per decade). The most pronounced warming is seen over the Eurasian sector of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent land areas, with the highest rates of change in the Barents Sea and over Svalbard, where rates of change are twice the mean of the Eurasian Arctic. The spatial pattern of the warming can be compared with the trend in Arctic sea-ice cover over the same period (Fig. 1b). Areas with high rates of temperature change closely match the regions with high rates of sea-ice loss, emphasizing the expected link between high-amplitude warming, high rates of temperature change and concurrent sea-ice retreat. A natural question that follows from this observation is are these rates of change comparable to the abrupt changes identified in the palaeoclimate record? Abrupt climate changes, as seen in Greenland We next turn to the records of abrupt change in the Greenland ice-core record and compare these with modern Arctic changes. Last glacial DO events. During the last glacial period (120,000-11,000 years ago), more than 20 abrupt periods of warming, known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, took place 18,19. Their impacts can be detected globally in palaeo-archives 20 , but their most marked expression is seen in the deep Greenland ice-core records 21-23. These are the classic and most discussed examples of abrupt climate change, characterized by a series of rapid and high-amplitude warming events over Greenland followed by a more gradual return to cold conditions 18,19. They show that key elements of the climate system are capable of changing abruptly-in particular, in the Arctic region-but with major repercussions throughout the climate system 24-26. Here, we compare present rates of change with those of the past, acknowledging the differences in background climate state (last glacial versus modern era of global warming), differences between their forcing mechanisms (greenhouse gas-driven change in the contemporary Arctic versus unforced change in the past) and differences in the geographical positioning of the changes. In addition, we note that many of the proposed mechanisms driving DO events involve sudden changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and associated ocean-atmosphere heat flux 27,28 , with sea-ice retreat a critical aspect driving the event rapidity and amplitude 29-33. Here, however, we focus primarily on the rates of change rather than the physical mechanisms of the processes involved. A recent review of the dynamics can be found in ref. 34. Quantifying the amplitude of the abrupt warmings recorded in ice cores is done by calibrating the water isotope palaeothermom-eter with absolute temperature change estimates derived from measurements of gas fractionation 35-37. The most comprehensive Abrupt climate change is a striking feature of many climate records, particularly the warming events in Greenland ice cores. These abrupt and high-amplitude events were tightly coupled to rapid sea-ice retreat in the North Atlantic and Nordic Seas, and observational evidence shows they had global repercussions. In the present-day Arctic, sea-ice loss is also key to ongoing warming. This Perspective uses observations and climate models to place contemporary Arctic change into the context of past abrupt Greenland warmings. We find that warming rates similar to or higher than modern trends have only occurred during past abrupt glacial episodes. We argue that the Arctic is currently experiencing an abrupt climate change event, and that climate models underestimate this ongoing warming.

   abstract = {Quantifying signals and uncertainties in climate models is essential for the detection, attribution, prediction and projection of climate change 1-3. Although inter-model agreement is high for large-scale temperature signals, dynamical changes in atmospheric circulation are very uncertain 4. This leads to low confidence in regional projections, especially for precipitation, over the coming decades 5,6. The chaotic nature of the climate system 7-9 may also mean that signal uncertainties are largely irreducible. However, climate projections are difficult to verify until further observations become available. Here we assess retrospective climate model predictions of the past six decades and show that decadal variations in North Atlantic winter climate are highly predictable, despite a lack of agreement between individual model simulations and the poor predictive ability of raw model outputs. Crucially, current models underestimate the predictable signal (the predictable fraction of the total variability) of the North Atlantic Oscillation (the leading mode of variability in North Atlantic atmospheric circulation) by an order of magnitude. Consequently, compared to perfect models, 100 times as many ensemble members are needed in current models to extract this signal, and its effects on the climate are underestimated relative to other factors. To address these limitations, we implement a two-stage post-processing technique. We first adjust the variance of the ensemble-mean North Atlantic Oscillation forecast to match the observed variance of the predictable signal. We then select and use only the ensemble members with a North Atlantic Oscillation sufficiently close to the variance-adjusted ensemble-mean forecast North Atlantic Oscillation. This approach greatly improves decadal predictions of winter climate for Europe and eastern North America. Predictions of Atlantic multidecadal variability are also improved, suggesting that the North Atlantic Oscillation is not driven solely by Atlantic multidecadal variability. Our results highlight the need to understand why the signal-to-noise ratio is too small in current climate models 10 , and the extent to which correcting this model error would reduce uncertainties in regional climate change projections on timescales beyond a decade. Global climate models are used extensively to understand the drivers of past climate variability and change, and to predict what is likely to happen in the future 1-3. Underpinning this is a need for accurate estimates of signals and associated uncertainties in climate model simulations, to distinguish between different causes of past climate change and to provide reliable confidence limits on future projections. Uncertainties are typically partitioned into three sources 11 : scenario uncertainty arising from an imperfect knowledge of external forcing factors, including changes in greenhouse gases, ozone, anthropogenic and volcanic aerosols, and solar irradiance; modelling uncertainty arising from the fact that different models respond differently to the same radiative forcing; and internal climate variability that would occur in the absence of any external forcing. Climate projections for many regions are currently highly uncertain, especially for atmospheric circulation 4,12 and related effects, including precipitation 5,6. This is particularly well illustrated by the fact that modelling 13,14 and internal variability 7,8 uncertainties are each large enough to allow opposite projections of European winters, especially https://doi.},

Using a collection of coordinated atmospheric and coupled global climate model perturbation experiments, we find an emergent relationship between the high‐latitude 1000‐500 hPa thickness response and an enhancement of the Siberian High in winter. This wave‐number‐1‐like sea level pressure anomaly pattern is linked to an equatorward shift of the eddy‐driven jet and a dynamical cooling response in eastern Asia. Additional simulations, where AA is imposed directly into the model domain by nudging, demonstrate how the sea ice forcing is insufficient by itself to capture the vertical extent of the warming and by extension the amplitude of the response in the Siberian high. This study demonstrates the importance of the vertical extent of the tropospheric warming over the polar cap in revealing the "warm Arctic, cold Siberia" anomaly pattern in future projections.},

   abstract = {The evolving roles of anthropogenic aerosols (AER) and greenhouse gases (GHG) in driving large-scale patterns of precipitation and SST trends during 1920-2080 are studied using a new set of ''all-but-one-forcing'' initial-condition large ensembles (LEs) with the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1), which complement the original ''all-forcing'' CESM1 LE (ALL). The large number of ensemble members (15-20) in each of the new LEs enables regional impacts of AER and GHG to be isolated from the noise of the model's internal variability. Our analysis approach, based on running 50-yr trends, accommodates geographical and temporal changes in patterns of forcing and response. AER are shown to be the primary driver of large-scale patterns of externally forced trends in ALL before the late 1970s, and GHG to dominate thereafter. The AER and GHG forced trends are spatially distinct except during the 1970s transition phase when aerosol changes are mainly confined to lower latitudes. The transition phase is also characterized by a relative minimum in the amplitude of forced trend patterns in ALL, due to a combination of reduced AER and partially offsetting effects of AER and GHG. Internal variability greatly limits the detectability of AER-and GHG-forced trend patterns in individual realizations based on pattern correlation metrics, especially during the historical period, highlighting the need for LEs. We estimate that ,20% of the spatial variances of observed precipitation and SST trends are attributable to AER and GHG forcing, although model biases in patterns of forced response and signal-to-noise may affect this estimate.},

Despite a precipitation bias, the seasonality of rainfall over South America is reproduced in LENS, as well as the main circulation features associated with the development of the South American Monsoon. Both onset and retreat of the wet season over South America are delayed in future compared to current climate by 3 and 7 days respectively, with a slightly longer wet season. Central and Southeastern Brazil are projected to get wetter as a result of moisture convergence from the strengthening of the South Atlantic Low Level Jet and a weaker South Atlantic Subtropical High. The Amazon is projected to get drier by the end of the century, negatively affecting rainforest productivity. During the wet season , an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events is found over most of South America, and especially over Northeastern and Southern Brazil and La Plata.

So far, however, no methods for quantifying uncertainties of explanations have been conceived, which is problematic in domains where a high confidence in explanations is a prerequisite. We therefore contribute by proposing a new framework that allows to convert any arbitrary explanation method for neural networks into an explanation method for Bayesian neural networks, with an in-built modeling of uncertainties. Within the Bayesian framework a network's weights follow a distribution that extends standard single explanation scores and heatmaps to distributions thereof, in this manner translating the intrinsic network model uncertainties into a quantification of explanation uncertainties. This allows us for the first time to carve out uncertainties associated with a model explanation and subsequently gauge the appropriate level of explanation confidence for a user (using percentiles). We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach extensively in various experiments, both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

   abstract = {Seasonal predictability of the minimum sea ice extent (SIE) in the Laptev Sea is investigated using winter coastal divergence as a predictor. From February to May, the new ice forming in wind-driven coastal polynyas grows to a thickness approximately equal to the climatological thickness loss due to summer thermodynamic processes. Estimating the area of sea ice that is preconditioned to melt enables seasonal predictability of the minimum SIE. Wintertime ice motion is quantified by seeding passive tracers along the coastlines and advecting them with the Lagrangian Ice Tracking System (LITS) forced with sea ice drifts from the Polar Pathfinder dataset for years 1992-2016. LITS-derived landfast ice estimates are comparable to those of the Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute ice charts. Time series of the minimum SIE and coastal divergence show trends of -24.2% and +31.3% per decade, respectively. Statistically significant correlation (r = -0.63) between anomalies of coastal divergence and the following September SIE occurs for coastal divergence integrated from February to the beginning of May. Using the coastal divergence anomaly to predict the minimum SIE departure from the trend improves the explained variance by 21% compared to hindcasts based on persistence of the linear trend. Coastal divergence anomalies correlate with the winter mean Arctic Oscillation index (r = 0.69). LITS-derived areas of coastal divergence tend to underestimate the total area covered by thin ice in the CryoSat-2/SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) thickness dataset, as suggested by a thermodynamic sea ice growth model.},

   abstract = {<p>Extreme weather events in Asia have been occurring with increasing frequency as the globe warms in response to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. Many of these events arise from weather regimes that persist over a region for days or even weeks, resulting in disruptive heatwaves, droughts, flooding, snowfalls, and cold spells. We investigate changes in the persistence of large-scale weather systems through a pattern-recognition approach based on daily 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies over the Asian continent. By tracking consecutive days that the atmosphere resides in a particular pattern, we identify long-duration events (LDEs), defined as lasting longer than three days, and measure their frequency of occurrence over time in each pattern. We find that regimes featuring positive height anomalies in high latitudes are occurring more often as the Arctic warms faster than mid-latitudes, both in the recent past and in model projections for the twenty-first century assuming unabated greenhouse gas emissions. The increased dominance of these patterns corresponds to a higher likelihood of LDEs, suggesting that persistent weather conditions will occur more frequently. By mapping observed temperature and precipitation extremes onto each atmospheric regime, we gain insight into the types of disruptive weather events that will become more prevalent as particular patterns become more common.</p>},

It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.

   abstract = {The importance of stratospheric ozone depletion on the atmospheric circulation of the troposphere is studied with an atmospheric general circulation model, the Community Atmospheric Model, version 3 (CAM3), for the second half of the twentieth century. In particular, the relative importance of ozone depletion is contrasted with that of increased greenhouse gases and accompanying sea surface temperature changes. By specifying ozone and greenhouse gas forcings independently, and performing long, time-slice integrations, it is shown that the impacts of ozone depletion are roughly 2-3 times larger than those associated with increased greenhouse gases, for the Southern Hemisphere tropospheric summer circulation. The formation of the ozone hole is shown to affect not only the polar tropopause and the latitudinal position of the midlatitude jet; it extends to the entire hemisphere, resulting in a broadening of the Hadley cell and a poleward extension of the subtropical dry zones. The CAM3 results are compared to and found to be in excellent agreement with those of the multimodel means of the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) and Chemistry-Climate Model Validation (CCMVal2) simulations. This study, therefore, strongly suggests that most Southern Hemisphere tropospheric circulation changes, in austral summer over the second half of the twentieth century, have been caused by polar stratospheric ozone depletion. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

We show that our approach, MeLIME, produces more meaningful explanations compared to other techniques over different ML models, operating on various types of data. MeLIME generalizes the LIME method, allowing more flexible perturbation sampling and the use of different local interpretable models. Additionally, we introduce modifications to standard training algorithms of local interpretable models fostering more robust explanations, even allowing the production of counterfactual examples. To show the strengths of the proposed approach, we include experiments on tabular data, images, and text; all showing improved explanations. In particular, MeLIME generated more meaningful explanations on the MNIST dataset than methods such as GuidedBackprop, SmoothGrad, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation.

Initial-condition large ensembles with ensemble sizes ranging from 30 to 100 members have become a commonly used tool for quantifying the forced response and internal variability in various components of the climate system. However, there is no consensus on the ideal or even sufficient ensemble size for a large ensemble. Here, we introduce an objective method to estimate the required ensemble size that can be applied to any given application and demonstrate its use on the examples of global mean near-surface air temperature, local temperature and precipitation, and variability in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) region and central United States for the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE). Estimating the required ensemble size is relevant not only for designing or choosing a large ensemble but also for designing targeted sensitivity experiments with a model. Where possible, we base our estimate of the required ensemble size on the pre-industrial control simulation, which is available for every model. We show that more ensemble members are needed to quantify variability than the forced response, with the largest ensemble sizes needed to detect changes in internal variability itself. Finally, we highlight that the required ensemble size depends on both the acceptable error to the user and the studied quantity.</p>},

However, until now, there have been only limited assessments of riverine heat impacts. Here, we adopted a synthesis of a pan-Arctic sea ice-ocean model and a land surface model to quantify impacts of river heat on the Arctic sea ice and ocean heat budget. We show that river heat contributed up to 10% of the regional sea ice reduction over the Arctic shelves from 1980 to 2015. Particularly notable, this effect occurs as earlier sea ice breakup in late spring and early summer. The increasing ice-free area in the shelf seas results in a warmer ocean in summer, enhancing ocean-atmosphere energy exchange and atmospheric warming. Our findings suggest that a positive river heat-sea ice feedback nearly doubles the river heat effect.},

This approach not only has the potential to accelerate climate change projections by reducing the costs of scenario computations, but also helps uncover early indicators of modelled long-term climate responses, which is of relevance to climate change detection, predictability, and attribution. Our results highlight challenges and opportunities for data-driven climate modelling, especially concerning the incorporation of even larger model datasets in the future.

We examine the social, economic, and risk factors that affect the decisions to evacuate and whether to go to a shelter or motel/hotel relative to other destinations. The most important predictor of evacuation is storm intensity. Households are more likely to evacuate when given evacuation orders, when they perceive a flood risk, and when they live in mobile homes. Households who own pets are less likely to evacuate. Non-white households, pet owners and those with more education are less likely to go to either a motel/hotel or shelter, preferring instead to stay with friends or family. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Two hurricanes that approached South Carolina but hit in North Carolina allowed us to study the impact of repeated "false alarms" (evacuations ordered based on expectations of a hurricane landfall that proved to be wrong). Differences in evacuation behavior, specific information and concerns prompting evacuation, and the reliability of information sources between hurricane events are examined to determine the impact of false alarms on the credibility of warning systems. Data were derived from a face-to-face survey of residents 2 weeks after Hurricane Fran in September 1996. We found that the role of official advisories was more limited than reported in previous research as people sought information on more diverse sets of concerns in their decision making. Reliance on the media and the Weather Channel, in particular, for storm characteristics and advisories was an important factor in evacuation decision making during both hurricane events. The perceived lack of reliability of gubernatorial warnings coupled with dependence on the media suggests that residents find other sources of information more personally relevant. Thus, while residents do not find that officials are "crying wolf," they are searching elsewhere for information to assess their own risk—what does it mean to me if there is a wolf? This increased attention toward individual differences in perceived threat may become more pronounced in future evacuations from hurricanes. © 1998 Taylor & Francis.},

However, using four logistic regressions to analyze differences in departure times by day shows that the only significant variable across the three main days of evacuation was our proxy variable for evacuation-order times. Depending on the day, other variables of interest include number of household vehicles, previous hurricane experience, and receipt of an evacuation order.

   abstract = {This study investigates the influence of individuals’ social connections in their decision to either evacuate or not evacuate in the days preceding the landfall of Hurricane Irma. Using Hurricane Irma in September 2017 as a case study, a survey was conducted on two groups (those who evacuated and those who did not evacuate) to assess people’s social connections specifically examining three dimensions: dependability, density, and diversity. These variables, together with socioeconomic variables (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, education), were considered in order to better explain the influences on evacuation decision-making. To collect accurate ephemeral decision-making data from evacuees, the surveys were completed during the evacuation for those who evacuated and shortly after the passage of Hurricane Irma for those who did not evacuate. Through statistical analyses, it was concluded that density and diversity of people’s social networks played a significant role in the decision to evacuate or not, with evacuees having more dense and diverse relationships. On the other hand, the perceived dependability of a person’s social connections (i.e., their perceived access to resources and support) did not significantly impact the decision to evacuate for Hurricane Irma. This study has important implications for adding to the knowledge base on community-based sustainable disaster preparedness and resilience.},

   abstract = {Hurricanes Isaac (2012), Harvey (2017), and Irma (2017) were storms with different geophysical characteristics and track forecast consistencies. Despite the differences, common themes emerged from the perception of track forecasts from evacuees for each storm. Surveys with a mixture of closed and open-ended responses were conducted during the evacuations of each storm while the storm characteristics and decision-making were fresh in the minds of evacuees. Track perception accuracy for each evacuee was quantified by taking the difference between three metrics: Perceived track and official track (PT − OT), perceived track and forecast track (PT − FT), and home location and perceived track (HL − PT). Evacuees from Hurricanes Isaac and Harvey displayed a tendency to perceive hurricane tracks as being closer to their home locations than what was forecast to occur and what actually occurred. The large sample collected for Hurricane Irma provided a chance to statistically verify some of the hypotheses generated from Isaac and Harvey. Results from Hurricane Irma confirmed that evacuees expected a storm to be closer to their home locations after controlling for regional influences. Furthermore, participants with greater previous hurricane experience perceived a track as being closer to their home locations, and participants residing in zip codes corresponding with nonmandatory evacuation zones also perceived tracks as being closer to their home locations. These findings suggest that most evacuees from hurricanes in the United States appear to perceive storms as being closer to their home locations than they are and overestimate wind speeds at their homes, thus overestimating the true danger from landfalling hurricanes in many storms.},

   abstract = {The evolution of a hurricane—how the track, intensity, forward speed, and resulting hazard effects on land (strong winds, flooding) develop over its lifetime—is often highly uncertain. Further, the uncertainty is dynamic because it is resolved as events unfold until ultimately the storm's evolution is known completely, and because the ensemble of forecasts changes over time. Emergency managers recognize these challenges and may engage in some combination of robust, adaptive, or repeated planning to address them. However, science- and engineering-based evacuation decision support models typically do not formally incorporate uncertainty. This article discusses the use of formal modeling to support robust, adaptive, and repeated decision-making during an impending hurricane. It also details a case study of Hurricane Isabel (2003) in North Carolina using the recently introduced Integrated Scenario-based Evacuation (ISE) computational framework to compare the effects of including each of the three features in the modeling. Findings suggest that making the evacuation planning robust, adaptive, and repeated should improve results by reducing both the numbers of people at risk and unnecessary evacuation orders and travel. The magnitude of those benefits, however, depends on uncertainty in, and evolution of, the attributes of the particular hurricane.},

   abstract = {This study uses data from a survey of coastal Miami-Dade County, Florida, residents to explore how different types of forecast and warning messages influence evacuation decisions, in conjunction with other factors. The survey presented different members of the public with different test messages about the same hypothetical hurricane approaching Miami. Participants' responses to the information were evaluated using questions about their likelihood of evacuating and their perceptions of the information and the information source. Recipients of the test message about storm surge height and the message about extreme impacts from storm surge had higher evacuation intentions, compared to nonrecipients. However, recipients of the extreme-impacts message also rated the information as more overblown and the information source as less reliable. The probabilistic message about landfall location interacted with the other textual messages in unexpected ways, reducing the other messages' effects on evacuation intentions. These results illustrate the importance of considering trade-offs, unintended effects, and information interactions when deciding how to convey weather information. Recipients of the test message that described the effectiveness of evacuation had lower perceptions that the information was overblown, suggesting the potential value of efficacy messaging. In addition, respondents with stronger individualist worldviews rated the information as significantly more overblown and had significantly lower evacuation intentions. This illustrates the importance of understanding how and why responses to weather messages vary across subpopulations. Overall, the analysis demonstrates the potential value of systematically investigating how different people respond to different types of weather risk messages.},

A household's evacuation decision is framed as an optimal stopping problem in which every potential evacuation time period prior to the actual hurricane landfall, the household's optimal choice is to either evacuate or to wait one more time period for a revised hurricane forecast. We build a realistic multiperiod model of evacuation that incorporates actual forecast and evacuation cost data for our designated Gulf of Mexico region. Results from our multiperiod model are calibrated with existing evacuation timing data from a number of hurricanes. Given the calibrated dynamic framework, a number of policy questions that plausibly affect the timing of household evacuations are analyzed, and a deeper understanding of existing empirical outcomes in regard to the timing of the evacuation decision is achieved. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

This exploratory analysis draws upon interviews with key government officials and media figures, archival research of Florida newspapers, analysis of 962 public comments on the National Hurricane Center's cone of uncertainty graphic, a separate multiagency study of 2004 hurricane behavior, and relevant risk communication literature, to identify several characteristics of this graphic that likely contribute to public misinterpretation.

   abstract = {Although evacuation is one of the best strategies for protecting citizens from hurricane threat, the ways that local elected officials use hurricane data in deciding whether to issue hurricane evacuation orders is not well understood. To begin to address this problem, we examined the effects of hurricane track and intensity information in a laboratory setting where participants judged the probability that hypothetical hurricanes with a constant bearing (i.e., straight line forecast track) would make landfall in each of eight 45 degree sectors around the Gulf of Mexico. The results from 162 participants in a student sample showed that the judged strike probability distributions over the eight sectors within each scenario were, unsurprisingly, unimodal and centered on the sector toward which the forecast track pointed. More significantly, although strike probability judgments for the sector in the direction of the forecast track were generally higher than the corresponding judgments for the other sectors, the latter were not zero. Most significantly, there were no appreciable differences in the patterns of strike probability judgments for hurricane tracks represented by a forecast track only, an uncertainty cone only, or forecast track with an uncertainty cone-a result consistent with a recent survey of coastal residents threatened by Hurricane Charley. The study results suggest that people are able to correctly process basic information about hurricane tracks but they do make some errors. More research is needed to understand the sources of these errors and to identify better methods of displaying uncertainty about hurricane parameters. © 2013 Society for Risk Analysis.},

   abstract = {A common approach to sampling the space of a prediction is the generation of an ensemble of potential outcomes, where the ensemble's distribution reveals the statistical structure of the prediction space. For example, the US National Hurricane Center generates multiple day predictions for a storm's path, size, and wind speed, and then uses a Monte Carlo approach to sample this prediction into a large ensemble of potential storm outcomes. Various forms of summary visualizations are generated from such an ensemble, often using spatial spread to indicate its statistical characteristics. However, studies have shown that changes in the size of such summary glyphs, representing changes in the uncertainty of the prediction, are frequently confounded with other attributes of the phenomenon, such as its size or strength. In addition, simulation ensembles typically encode multivariate information, which can be difficult or confusing to include in a summary display. This problem can be overcome by directly displaying the ensemble as a set of annotated trajectories, however this solution will not be effective if ensembles are densely overdrawn or structurally disorganized. We propose to overcome these difficulties by selectively sampling the original ensemble, constructing a smaller representative and spatially well organized ensemble. This can be drawn directly as a set of paths that implicitly reveals the underlying spatial uncertainty distribution of the prediction. Since this approach does not use a visual channel to encode uncertainty, additional information can more easily be encoded in the display without leading to visual confusion. To demonstrate our argument, we describe the development of a visualization for ensembles of tropical cyclone forecast tracks, explaining how their spatial and temporal predictions, as well as other crucial storm characteristics such as size and intensity, can be clearly revealed. We verify the effectiveness of this visualization approach through a cognitive study exploring how storm damage estimates are affected by the density of tracks drawn, and by the presence or absence of annotating information on storm size and intensity.},

Historical housing unit data and future demographic projections from a high-resolution, spatial allocation model illustrate that the area within 50 km of the US Atlantic and Gulf Coastlines has the greatest housing unit density of any physiographic region in the USA, with residential development in this region outpacing non-coastal areas. Tropical cyclone exposure for six at-risk metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) along the US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts are assessed. All six MSAs evaluated are distinct in their development character, yet all experienced significant growth from 1940 through the contemporary period; projections from the model under various socioeconomic pathways reveal that this growth is anticipated to continue during the twenty-first century. Using a worst-case scenario framework, the historical and future residential data for the six MSAs are intersected with synthetic hurricane wind swaths generated from contemporary landfalling events. The New York City MSA contains the greatest residential built environment exposure, but Miami is the most rapidly changing MSA and has the greatest potential for hurricane disaster occurrence based on the juxtaposition of climatological risk and exposure. A disaster potential metric illustrates that all six MSAs will experience significant increases in disaster probability during the twenty-first century. This analysis facilitates a detailed spatiotemporal assessment of US coastal region vulnerability, providing decision makers with information that may be used to evaluate the potential for tropical cyclone disasters, mitigate tropical cyclone hazard impacts, and build community resilience for these and other hazards in the face of environmental and societal change.},

Over this period, 197 hurricanes resulted in 206 landfalls with about US$2 trillion in normalized (2018) damage, or just under US$17 billion annually. Consistent with observed trends in the frequency and intensity of hurricane landfalls along the continental United States since 1900, the updated normalized loss estimates also show no trend.

However, storm surge was removed from this scale following Hurricane Katrina (2005), leaving no scale-based method for storm surge risk communication despite its significant impacts on life and property. This study seeks to create a new, theoretical storm surge scale based on fiscal damage for effective risk analysis. Advanced Circulation model simulation output data of maximum water height and velocity were obtained for four storms: Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Gustav, Hurricane Ike, and Superstorm Sandy. Four countywide fiscal loss methods were then considered. The first three use National Centers for Environmental Information Storm Events Database (SED) property damages and Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) population, per capita personal income, or total income. The fourth uses National Flood Insurance Program total insured coverage and paid claims. Initial correlations indicated the statistical mode of storm surge data above the 90th percentile was most skillful; this metric was therefore chosen to represent countywide storm surge. Multiple linear regression assessed the most skillful combination of storm surge variables (height and velocity) and fiscal loss method (SED property damages and BEA population, i.e., loss per capita), and defined the proposed scale, named the Kuykendall scale. Comparison with the four storms' actual losses shows skillful performance, notably a 20% skill increase over surge heightonly approaches. The Kuykendall scale demonstrates promise for skillful future storm surge risk assessment in the analytical, academic, and operational domains.},

The survey explored respondents' evacuation decisions prior to Hurricane Rita, their perceptions of hurricane risk, and their use of and opinions on Hurricane Rita forecasts. The vast majority of respondents evacuated from Hurricane Rita, and more than half stated that Hurricane Katrina affected their evacuation decision. Although some respondents said that their primary reason for evacuating was local officials' evacuation order, many reported using information about the hurricane to evaluate the risk it posed to them and their families. Despite the major traffic jams and the minor damage in many evacuated regions, most evacuees interviewed do not regret their decision to evacuate. The majority of respondents stated that they intend to evacuate for a future category 3 hurricane, but the majority would stay for a category 2 hurricane. Most respondents obtained forecasts from multiple sources and reported checking forecasts frequently. Despite the forecast uncertainties, the respondents had high confidence in and satisfaction with the forecasts of Rita provided by the National Hurricane Center. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. Tensor-Flow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, generalpurpose GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate the compelling performance that Tensor-Flow achieves for several real-world applications.},

Therefore, it is crucial that domain specialists can understand and analyze actions and predictions, even of the most complex neural network architectures. Despite these arguments neural networks are often treated as black boxes. In the attempt to alleviate this shortcoming many analysis methods were proposed, yet the lack of reference implementations often makes a systematic comparison between the methods a major effort. The presented library iNNvestigate addresses this by providing a common interface and out-of-thebox implementation for many analysis methods, including the reference implementation for PatternNet and PatternAttribution as well as for LRP-methods. To demonstrate the versatility of iNNvestigate, we provide an analysis of image classifications for variety of state-of-the-art neural network architectures.},

   abstract = {Many problems in climate science require the identification of signals obscured by both the “noise” of internal climate variability and differences across models. Following previous work, we train an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the year of a given map of annual-mean temperature (or precipitation) from forced climate model simulations. This prediction task requires the ANN to learn forced patterns of change amidst a background of climate noise and model differences. We then apply a neural network visualization technique (layerwise relevance propagation) to visualize the spatial patterns that lead the ANN to successfully predict the year. These spatial patterns thus serve as “reliable indicators” of the forced change. The architecture of the ANN is chosen such that these indicators vary in time, thus capturing the evolving nature of regional signals of change. Results are compared to those of more standard approaches like signal-to-noise ratios and multilinear regression in order to gain intuition about the reliable indicators identified by the ANN. We then apply an additional visualization tool (backward optimization) to highlight where disagreements in simulated and observed patterns of change are most important for the prediction of the year. This work demonstrates that ANNs and their visualization tools make a powerful pair for extracting climate patterns of forced change.},

   abstract = {Neural networks have become increasingly prevalent within the geosciences, although a common limitation of their usage has been a lack of methods to interpret what the networks learn and how they make decisions. As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backward optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to common climate patterns. These results suggest that combining interpretable neural networks with novel scientific hypotheses will open the door to many new avenues in neural network-related geoscience research.},

   abstract = {Historical reanalyses that span more than a century are needed for a wide range of studies, from understanding large-scale climate trends to diagnosing the impacts of individual historical extreme weather events. The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) Project is an effort to fill this need. It is supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and is facilitated by collaboration with the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth initiative. 20CR is the first ensemble of sub-daily global atmospheric conditions spanning over 100 years. This provides a best estimate of the weather at any given place and time as well as an estimate of its confidence and uncertainty. While extremely useful, version 2c of this dataset (20CRv2c) has several significant issues, including inaccurate estimates of confidence and a global sea level pressure bias in the mid-19th century. These and other issues can reduce its effectiveness for studies at many spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, the 20CR system underwent a series of developments to generate a significant new version of the reanalysis. The version 3 system (NOAA-CIRES-DOE 20CRv3) uses upgraded data assimilation methods including an adaptive inflation algorithm; has a newer, higher-resolution forecast model that specifies dry air mass; and assimilates a larger set of pressure observations. These changes have improved the ensemble-based estimates of confidence, removed spin-up effects in the precipitation fields, and diminished the sea-level pressure bias. Other improvements include more accurate representations of storm intensity, smaller errors, and large-scale reductions in model bias. The 20CRv3 system is comprehensively reviewed, focusing on the aspects that have ameliorated issues in 20CRv2c. Despite the many improvements, some challenges remain, including a systematic bias in tropical precipitation and time-varying biases in southern high-latitude pressure fields.},

   abstract = {This paper describes a new eight-member ensemble of ocean reanalyses spanning nearly 200 years from 1815 to 2013 generated using the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation system with sparse observational input (SODAsi) to explore long-term changes in the oceans. The eight ensemble members assimilate surface temperature observations and use surface boundary conditions from an atmospheric reanalysis that is loosely coupled to the ocean reanalysis. Both surface and subsurface quantities, such as dynamic height and heat content, show a broad spectrum of variability. Surface temperature trends from 1815 to 2013 are positive in most regions, with some important exceptions; the central Tropical Pacific, around Antarctica, and in the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio extension regions all show cooling trends. A near-global average shows warming of about 0.8°C over the full period, with most of the warming occurring after 1920. There is pronounced multidecadal variability in both the midlatitude and tropical oceans. In the North Atlantic Ocean, temperature variability is highly correlated with the meridional overturning stream function, with the largest correlation occurring when the stream function is advanced by 9 years. Trends of upper ocean heat content and dynamic height from the 1950s onward compare well with previously published values. Globally averaged heat content of the upper 700 m shows a nearly linear rise after the 1920s, requiring a net downward surface heat flux increase of 0.47 W m−2 into the ocean. This is close to published estimates of the increased flux required to explain the heat content increase from 1971 to 2010.},

   abstract = {The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project is an international effort to produce a comprehensive global atmospheric circulation dataset spanning the twentieth century, assimilating only surface pressure reports and using observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as boundary conditions. It is chiefly motivated by a need to provide an observational dataset with quantified uncertainties for validations of climate model simulations of the twentieth century on all time-scales, with emphasis on the statistics of daily weather. It uses an Ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation method with background 'first guess' fields supplied by an ensemble of forecasts from a global numerical weather prediction model. This directly yields a global analysis every 6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere, and also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis. The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of global tropospheric variability, and of the dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the present at 6-hourly temporal and 2° spatial resolutions. Intercomparisons with independent radiosonde data indicate that the reanalyses are generally of high quality. The quality in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere throughout the century is similar to that of current three-day operational NWP forecasts. Intercomparisons over the second half-century of these surface-based reanalyses with other reanalyses that also make use of upper-air and satellite data are equally encouraging. It is anticipated that the 20CR dataset will be a valuable resource to the climate research community for both model validations and diagnostic studies. Some surprising results are already evident. For instance, the long-term trends of indices representing the North Atlantic Oscillation, the tropical Pacific Walker Circulation, and the Pacific-North American pattern are weak or non-existent over the full period of record. The long-term trends of zonally averaged precipitation minus evaporation also differ in character from those in climate model simulations of the twentieth century. © 2011 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright.},

   abstract = {The interaction of anthropogenic aerosols with radiation and clouds is the largest source of uncertainty in the radiative forcing of the climate during the industrial period. Here we apply novel techniques to diagnose the contributors to the shortwave (SW) effective radiative forcing (ERF) from aerosol-radiation-interaction (ERFari) and from aerosol cloud interaction (ERFaci) in experiments performed in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We find that the ensemble mean SW ERFari+aci of -1.40±0.56 W m-2 comes roughly 25% from ERFari (-0.35±0.20 W m-2) and 75% from ERFaci (-1.04±0.67 W m-2). ERFari is made up of -0.62±0.30 W m-2 due to aerosol scattering opposed by +0.26 ± 0.12 W m-2 due to aerosol absorption and is largest near emission sources. The ERFari from nonsulfate aerosols is +0.13 ± 0.09 W m-2, consisting of -0.15±0.11 W m-2 of scattering and +0.29 ± 0.15 W m-2 of absorption. The change in clear-sky flux is a negatively biased measure of ERFari, as the presence of clouds reduces the magnitude and intermodel spread of ERFari by 40-50%. ERFaci, which is large both near and downwind of emission sources, is composed of -0.99±0.54 W m-2 from enhanced cloud scattering, with much smaller contributions from increased cloud amount and absorption. In models that allow aerosols to affect ice clouds, large increases in the optical depth of high clouds cause substantial longwave and shortwave radiative anomalies. Intermodel spread in ERFaci is dominated by differences in how aerosols increase cloud scattering, but even if all models agreed on this effect, over a fifth of the spread in ERFaci would remain due solely to differences in total cloud amount.

   abstract = {Aerosols interact with radiation and clouds. Substantial progress made over the past 40 years in observing, understanding, and modeling these processes helped quantify the imbalance in the Earth's radiation budget caused by anthropogenic aerosols, called aerosol radiative forcing, but uncertainties remain large. This review provides a new range of aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial era based on multiple, traceable, and arguable lines of evidence, including modeling approaches, theoretical considerations, and observations. Improved understanding of aerosol absorption and the causes of trends in surface radiative fluxes constrain the forcing from aerosol-radiation interactions. A robust theoretical foundation and convincing evidence constrain the forcing caused by aerosol-driven increases in liquid cloud droplet number concentration. However, the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud liquid water content and cloud fraction is less clear, and the influence on mixed-phase and ice clouds remains poorly constrained. Observed changes in surface temperature and radiative fluxes provide additional constraints. These multiple lines of evidence lead to a 68% confidence interval for the total aerosol effective radiative forcing of -1.6 to -0.6 W m−2, or -2.0 to -0.4 W m−2 with a 90% likelihood. Those intervals are of similar width to the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment but shifted toward more negative values. The uncertainty will narrow in the future by continuing to critically combine multiple lines of evidence, especially those addressing industrial-era changes in aerosol sources and aerosol effects on liquid cloud amount and on ice clouds.},

Results show that nonlinear effects are small in the global mean of the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative fluxes, surface air temperature, and precipitation. However, significant nonlinear effects exist over the Arctic and other extratropical regions during certain seasons. When both forcings are included, Arctic sea ice in September-November decreases less than the linear combination of the responses to the individual forcings due to a higher sea ice sensitivity to the CO2induced warming than the sensitivity to the AA-induced cooling. This leads to less Arctic warming in the combined-forcing experiment due to reduced energy release from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere. Some nonlinear effects on precipitation in June-August are found over East Asia, with the northward-shifted East Asian summer rain belt to oppose the CO2 effect. In December-February, the aerosol loading over Europe in the combined-forcing experiment is higher than that due to the AA forcing, resulting from CO2-induced circulation changes. The changed aerosol loading results in regional thermal responses due to aerosol direct and indirect effects, weakening the combined changes of temperature and circulation. This study highlights the need to consider nonlinear effects from historical CO2 and AA forcings in seasonal and regional climate attribution analyses.},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic changes to land cover (LCC) remain common, but continuing land scarcity promotes the widespread intensification of land management changes (LMC) to better satisfy societal demand for food, fibre, fuel and shelter. The biophysical effects of LCC on surface climate are largely understood, particularly for the boreal and tropical zones, but fewer studies have investigated the biophysical consequences of LMC; that is, anthropogenic modification without a change in land cover type. Harmonized analysis of ground measurements and remote sensing observations of both LCC and LMC revealed that, in the temperate zone, potential surface cooling from increased albedo is typically offset by warming from decreased sensible heat fluxes, with the net effect being a warming of the surface. Temperature changes from LMC and LCC were of the same magnitude, and averaged 2 K at the vegetation surface and were estimated at 1.7 K in the planetary boundary layer. Given the spatial extent of land management (42-58% of the land surface) this calls for increasing the efforts to integrate land management in Earth System Science to better take into account the human impact on the climate. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In this study, we use six single model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs) and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) to visualise the role of internal variability in controlling possible observable surface temperature trends in the short-term and mid-term projections from 2019 onwards. We confirm that in the short-term, surface temperature trend projections are dominated by internal variability, with little influence of structural model differences or warming pathway. Additionally we demonstrate that this result is independent of the model-dependent estimate of the magnitude of internal variability. Indeed, and perhaps counter intuitively, in all models a lack of warming, or even a cooling trend could be observed at all individual points on the globe, even under the largest greenhouse gas emissions. The near-equivalence of all six SMILEs and CMIP5 demonstrates the robustness of this result to the choice of models used. On the mid-term time-scale, we confirm that structural model differences and scenario uncertainties play a larger role in controlling surface temperature trend projections than they did on the shorter time-scale. In addition we show that whether internal variability still dominates, or whether model uncertainties and internal variability are a similar magnitude, depends on the estimate of internal variability, which differs between the SMILEs. Finally we show that even out to thirty years large parts of the globe (or most of the globe in MPI-GE and CMIP5) could still experience no-warming due to internal variability.},

New developments in this framework include an off-line volume-conservative mapping to a cubed-sphere grid, improvements to the CNN architecture and the minimization of the loss function over multiple steps in a prediction sequence. The cubed-sphere remapping minimizes the distortion on the cube faces on which convolution operations are performed and provides natural boundary conditions for padding in the CNN. Our improved model produces weather forecasts that are indefinitely stable and produce realistic weather patterns at lead times of several weeks and longer. For short- to medium-range forecasting, our model significantly outperforms persistence, climatology, and a coarse-resolution dynamical numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Unsurprisingly, our forecasts are worse than those from a high-resolution state-of-the-art operational NWP system. Our data-driven model is able to learn to forecast complex surface temperature patterns from few input atmospheric state variables. On annual time scales, our model produces a realistic seasonal cycle driven solely by the prescribed variation in top-of-atmosphere solar forcing. Although it currently does not compete with operational weather forecasting models, our data-driven CNN executes much faster than those models, suggesting that machine learning could prove to be a valuable tool for large-ensemble forecasting.},

   abstract = {The representation of nonlinear subgrid processes, especially clouds, has been a major source of uncertainty in climate models for decades. Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be run globally but only for short-term simulations of at most a few years because of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all atmospheric subgrid processes in a climate model by learning from a multiscale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural network then replaces the traditional subgrid parameterizations in a global general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multiyear simulations are stable and closely reproduce not only the mean climate of the cloud-resolving simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to. Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning for climate model parameterization. In a broader context, we anticipate that data-driven Earth system model development could play a key role in reducing climate prediction uncertainty in the coming decade.},

   abstract = {Ensembles of climate model simulations are commonly used to separate externally forced climate change from internal variability. However, much of the information gained from running large ensembles is lost in traditional methods of data reduction such as linear trend analysis or large-scale spatial averaging. This paper demonstrates how a pattern recognition method (signal-to-noise-maximizing pattern filtering) extracts patterns of externally forced climate change from large ensembles and identifies the forced climate response with up to 10 times fewer ensemble members than simple ensemble averaging. It is particularly effective at filtering out spatially coherent modes of internal variability (e.g., El Ninõ, North Atlantic Oscillation), which would otherwise alias into estimates of regional responses to forcing. This method is used to identify forced climate responses within the 40-member Community Earth System Model (CESM) large ensemble, including an El Ninõ-like response to volcanic eruptions and forced trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation. The ensemblebased estimate of the forced response is used to test statistical methods for isolating the forced response from a single realization (i.e., individual ensemble members). Low-frequency pattern filtering is found to skillfully identify the forced response within individual ensemble members and is applied to the HadCRUT4 reconstruction of observed temperatures, whereby it identifies slow components of observed temperature changes that are consistent with the expected effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing.},

Radar images come from the Multiyear Reanalysis of Remotely Sensed Storms (MYRORSS) and Gridded NEXRAD WSR-88D Radar dataset (GridRad), both of which are multiradar composites. We train separate CNNs on MYRORSS and GridRad data, present an experiment to optimize the CNN settings, and evaluate the chosen CNNs on independent testing data. Both models achieve an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) well above 0.9, which is considered to be excellent performance. The GridRad model achieves a critical success index (CSI) of 0.31, and the MYRORSS model achieves a CSI of 0.17. The difference is due primarily to event frequency (percentage of storms that are tornadic in the next hour), which is 3.52% for GridRad but only 0.24% for MYRORSS. The best CNN predictions (true positives and negatives) occur for strongly rotating tornadic supercells and weak nontornadic cells in mesoscale convective systems, respectively. The worst predictions (false positives and negatives) occur for strongly rotating nontornadic supercells and tornadic cells in quasilinear convective systems, respectively. The performance of our CNNs is comparable to an operational machine-learning system for severe weather prediction, which suggests that they would be useful for real-time forecasting.},

   abstract = {The theory of possibility described in this paper is related to the theory of fuzzy sets by defining the concept of a possibility distribution as a fuzzy restriction which acts as an elastic constraint on the values that may be assigned to a variable. More specifically, if F is a fuzzy subset of a universe of discourse U = \{u\} which is characterized by its membership function μF, then a proposition of the form "X is F", where X is a variable taking values in U, induces a possibility distribution t ̊x which equates the possibility of X taking the value u to μF(u)-the compatibility of u with F. In this way, X becomes a fuzzy variable which is associated with the possibility distribution t ̊x in much the same way as a random variable is associated with a probability distribution. In general, a variable may be associated both with a possibility distribution and a probability distribution, with the weak connection between the two expressed as the possibility/probability consistency principle. A thesis advanced in this paper is that the imprecision that is intrinsic in natural languages is, in the main, possibilistic rather than probabilistic in nature. Thus, by employing the concept of a possibility distribution, a proposition, p, in a natural language may be translated into a procedure which computes the probability distribution of a set of attributes which are implied by p. Several types of conditional translation rules are discussed and, in particular, a translation rule for propositions of the form "X is F is α-possible", where α is a number in the interval [0,1], is formulated and illustrated by examples. © 1978.},

   abstract = {Modern weather and climate models share a common heritage, and often even components, however they are used in different ways to answer fundamentally different questions. As such, attempts to emulate them using machine learning should reflect this. While the use of machine learning to emulate weather forecast models is a relatively new endeavour there is a rich history of climate model emulation. This is primarily because while weather modelling is an initial condition problem which intimately depends on the current state of the atmosphere, climate modelling is predominantly a boundary condition problem. In order to emulate the response of the climate to different drivers therefore, representation of the full dynamical evolution of the atmosphere is neither necessary, or in many cases, desirable. Climate scientists are typically interested in different questions also. Indeed emulating the steady-state climate response has been possible for many years and provides significant speed increases that allow solving inverse problems for e.g. parameter estimation. Nevertheless, the large datasets, non-linear relationships and limited training data make Climate a domain which is rich in interesting machine learning challenges. Here I seek to set out the current state of climate model emulation and demonstrate how, despite some challenges, recent advances in machine learning provide new opportunities for creating useful statistical models of the climate.},

However, the opaque decision making process of these systems is a disadvantage where interpretability is essential. Many feature-based explanation techniques have been introduced over the last few years in the field of machine learning to better understand decisions made by neural networks and have become an important component to verify their reasoning capabilities. However, existing methods do not allow statements to be made about the uncertainty regarding a feature's relevance for the prediction. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Relevance Propagation (MCRP) for feature relevance uncertainty estimation.

So far, however, no methods for quantifying uncertainties of explanations have been conceived, which is problematic in domains where a high confidence in explanations is a prerequisite. We therefore contribute by proposing a new framework that allows to convert any arbitrary explanation method for neural networks into an explanation method for Bayesian neural networks, with an in-built modeling of uncertainties. Within the Bayesian framework a network's weights follow a distribution that extends standard single explanation scores and heatmaps to distributions thereof, in this manner translating the intrinsic network model uncertainties into a quantification of explanation uncertainties. This allows us for the first time to carve out uncertainties associated with a model explanation and subsequently gauge the appropriate level of explanation confidence for a user (using percentiles). We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach extensively in various experiments, both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

   abstract = {Internal atmospheric variability fundamentally limits predictability of climate and obscures evidence of anthropogenic climate change regionally and on time scales of up to a few decades. Dynamical adjustment techniques estimate and subsequently remove the influence of atmospheric circulation variability on temperature or precipitation. The residual component is expected to contain the thermodynamical signal of the externally forced response but with less circulation-induced noise. Existing techniques have led to important insights into recent trends in regional (hydro-) climate and their drivers, but the variance explained by circulation is often low. Here, we develop a novel dynamical adjustment technique by implementing principles from statistical learning. We demonstrate in an ensemble of Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulations that statistical learning methods, such as regularized linear models, establish a clearer relationship between circulation variability and atmospheric target variables, and need relatively short periods of record for training (around 30 years). The method accounts for, on average, 83% and 78% of European monthly winter temperature and precipitation variability at gridcell level, and around 80% of global mean temperature and hemispheric precipitation variability. We show that the residuals retain forced thermodynamical contributions to temperature and precipitation variability. Accurate estimates of the total forced response can thus be recovered assuming that forced circulation changes are gradual over time. Overall, forced climate response estimates can be extracted at regional or global scales from approximately 3–5 times fewer ensemble members, or even a single realization, using statistical learning techniques. We anticipate the technique will contribute to reducing uncertainties around internal variability and facilitating climate change detection and attribution.},

The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

   abstract = {Abstract We assess evidence relevant to Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity per doubling of atmospheric CO2, characterized by an effective sensitivity S. This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2 K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5 K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density (PDF) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult-to-quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66% range is 2.6-3.9 K for our Baseline calculation, and remains within 2.3-4.5 K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5-95% ranges are 2.3-4.7 K, bounded by 2.0-5.7 K (although such high-confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent, and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S, in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing-feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.},

   abstract = {Large initial condition ensembles of a climate model simulation provide many different realizations of internal variability noise superimposed on an externally forced signal. They have been used to estimate signal emergence time at individual grid points, but are rarely employed to identify global fingerprints of human influence. Here we analyze 50- and 40-member ensembles performed with 2 climate models; each was run with combined human and natural forcings. We apply a pattern-based method to determine signal detection time td in individual ensemble members. Distributions of td are characterized by the median td\{m\} and range td\{r\}, computed for tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures over 1979 to 2018. Lower stratospheric cooling—primarily caused by ozone depletion—yields td\{m\} values between 1994 and 1996, depending on model ensemble, domain (global or hemispheric), and type of noise data. For greenhouse-gas–driven tropospheric warming, larger noise and slower recovery from the 1991 Pinatubo eruption lead to later signal detection (between 1997 and 2003). The stochastic uncertainty td\{r\} is greater for tropospheric warming (8 to 15 y) than for stratospheric cooling (1 to 3 y). In the ensemble generated by a high climate sensitivity model with low anthropogenic aerosol forcing, simulated tropospheric warming is larger than observed; detection times for tropospheric warming signals in satellite data are within td\{r\} ranges in 60% of all cases. The corresponding number is 88% for the second ensemble, which was produced by a model with even higher climate sensitivity but with large aerosol-induced cooling. Whether the latter result is physically plausible will require concerted efforts to reduce significant uncertainties in aerosol forcing.},

   abstract = {This study elucidates the physical mechanisms underlying internal and forced components of winter surface air temperature (SAT) trends over North America during the past 50 years (1963-2012) using a combined observational and modeling framework. The modeling framework consists of 30 simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) at 1° latitude-longitude resolution, each of which is subject to an identical scenario of historical radiative forcing but starts from a slightly different atmospheric state. Hence, any spread within the ensemble results from unpredictable internal variability superimposed upon the forced climate change signal. Constructed atmospheric circulation analogs are used to estimate the dynamical contribution to forced and internal components of SAT trends: Thermodynamic contributions are obtained as a residual. Internal circulation trends are estimated to account for approximately one-third of the observed wintertime warming trend over North America and more than half locally over parts of Canada and the United States. Removing the effects of internal atmospheric circulation variability narrows the spread of SAT trends within the CESM ensemble and brings the observed trends closer to the model's radiatively forced response. In addition, removing internal dynamics approximately doubles the signal-to-noise ratio of the simulated SAT trends and substantially advances the "time of emergence" of the forced component of SAT anomalies. The methodological framework proposed here provides a general template for improving physical understanding and interpretation of observed and simulated climate trends worldwide and may help to reconcile the diversity of SAT trends across the models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5).},

   abstract = {The early twentieth-century warming (EW; 1910–45) and the mid-twentieth-century cooling (MC; 1950–80) have been linked to both internal variability of the climate system and changes in external radiative forcing. The degree to which either of the two factors contributed to EW and MC, or both, is still debated. Using a two-box impulse response model, we demonstrate that multidecadal ocean variability was unlikely to be the driver of observed changes in global mean surface temperature (GMST) after AD 1850. Instead, virtually all (97%–98%) of the global low-frequency variability (>30 years) can be explained by external forcing. We find similarly high percentages of explained variance for interhemispheric and land–ocean temperature evolution. Three key aspects are identified that underpin the conclusion of this new study: inhomogeneous anthropogenic aerosol forcing (AER), biases in the instrumental sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, and inadequate representation of the response to varying forcing factors. Once the spatially heterogeneous nature of AER is accounted for, the MC period is reconcilable with external drivers. SST biases and imprecise forcing responses explain the putative disagreement between models and observations during the EW period. As a consequence, Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) is found to be primarily controlled by external forcing too. Future attribution studies should account for these important factors when discriminating between externally forced and internally generated influences on climate. We argue that AMV must not be used as a regressor and suggest a revised AMV index instead [the North Atlantic Variability Index (NAVI)]. Our associated best estimate for the transient climate response (TCR) is 1.57 K (±0.70 at the 5%–95% confidence level).},

   abstract = {A strategy using statistically optimal fingerprints to detect anthropogenic climate change is outlined and applied to near-surface temperature trends. The components of this strategy include observations, information about natural climate variability, and a "guess pattern" representing the expected time-space pattern of anthropogenic climate change. The expected anthropogenic climate change is identified through projection of the observations onto an appropriate optimal fingerprint, yielding a scalar-detection variable. The statistically optimal fingerprint is obtained by weighting the components of the guess pattern (truncated to some small-dimensional space) toward low-noise directions. The null hypothesis that the observed climate change is part of natural climate variability is then tested. This strategy is applied to detecting a greenhouse-gas-induced climate change in the spatial pattern of nearsurface temperature trends defined for time intervals of 15-30 years. The expected pattern of climate change is derived from a transient simulation with a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model. Global gridded near-surface temperature observations are used to represent the observed climate change. Information on the natural variability needed to establish the statistics of the detection variable is extracted from long control simulations of coupled ocean-atmosphere models and, additionally, from the observations themselves (from which an estimated greenhouse warming signal has been removed). While the model control simulations contain only variability caused by the internal dynamics of the atmosphere-ocean system, the observations additionally contain the response to various external forcings (e.g., volcanic eruptions, changes in solar radiation, and residual anthropogenic forcing). The resulting estimate of climate noise has large uncertainties but is qualitatively the best the authors can presently offer. The null hypothesis that the latest observed 20-yr and 30-yr trend of near-surface temperature (ending in 1994) is part of natural variability is rejected with a risk of less than 2.5% to 5% (the 5% level is derived from the variability of one model control simulation dominated by a questionable extreme event ). In other words, the probability that the warming is due to our estimated natural variability is less than 2.5% to 5%. The increase in the signal-to-noise ratio by optimization of the fingerprint is of the order of 10%-30% in most cases. The predicted signals are dominated by the global mean component; the pattern correlation excluding the global mean is positive but not very high. Both the evolution of the detection variable and also the pattern correlation results are consistent with the model prediction for greenhouse-gas-induced climate change. However, in order to attribute the observed warming uniquely to anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing, more information on the climate's response to other forcing mechanisms (e.g., changes in solar radiation, volcanic, or anthropogenic sulfate aerosols) and their interaction is needed. It is concluded that a statistically significant externally induced warming has been observed, but our caveat that the estimate of the internal climate variability is still uncertain is emphasized.},

Such good agreement could result from a fortuitous cancellation of errors, for example, by balancing too much (or too little) greenhouse warming by too much (or too little) aerosol cooling. Despite a very large uncertainty for estimates of the possible range of sulfate aerosol forcing obtained from measurement campaigns, results show that the spatial and temporal nature of observed twentieth-century temperature change constrains the component of past warming attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse gases to be significantly greater (at the 5% level) than the observed warming over the twentieth century. The cooling effects of aerosols are detected in all three models. Both spatial and temporal aspects of observed temperature change are responsible for constraining the relative roles of greenhouse warming and sulfate cooling over the twentieth century. This is because there are distinctive temporal structures in differential warming rates between the hemispheres, between land and ocean, and between mid- and low latitudes. As a result, consistent estimates of warming attributable to greenhouse gas emissions are obtained from all three models, and predictions are relatively robust to the use of more or less sensitive models. The transient climate response following a 1% yr-1 increase in CO2 is estimated to lie between 2.2 and 4 K century-1 (5-95 percentiles). © 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Recent coordinated efforts, in which numerous general circulation climate models have been run for a common set of experiments, have produced large datasets of projections of future climate for various scenarios. Those multimodel ensembles sample initial conditions, parameters, and structural uncertainties in the model design, and they have prompted a variety of approaches to quantifying uncertainty in future climate change. International climate change assessments also rely heavily on these models. These assessments often provide equal-weighted averages as best-guess results, assuming that individual model biases will at least partly cancel and that a model average prediction is more likely to be correct than a prediction from a single model based on the result that a multimodel average of present-day climate generally outperforms any individual model. This study outlines the motivation for using multimodel ensembles and discusses various challenges in interpreting them. Among these challenges are that the number of models in these ensembles is usually small, their distribution in the model or parameter space is unclear, and that extreme behavior is often not sampled. Model skill in simulating present-day climate conditions is shown to relate only weakly to the magnitude of predicted change. It is thus unclear by how much the confidence in future projections should increase based on improvements in simulating present-day conditions, a reduction of intermodel spread, or a larger number of models. Averaging model output may further lead to a loss of signal- for example, for precipitation change where the predicted changes are spatially heterogeneous, such that the true expected change is very likely to be larger than suggested by a model average. Last, there is little agreement on metrics to separate "good" and "bad" models, and there is concern that model development, evaluation, and posterior weighting or ranking are all using the same datasets. While the multimodel average appears to still be useful in some situations, these results show that more quantitative methods to evaluate model performance are critical to maximize the value of climate change projections from global models. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {The rate of global mean surface temperature (GMST) warming has slowed this century despite the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. Climate model experiments show that this slowdown was largely driven by a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), with a smaller external contribution from solar variability, and volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols. The prevailing view is that this negative PDO occurred through internal variability. However, here we show that coupled models from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project robustly simulate a negative PDO in response to anthropogenic aerosols implying a potentially important role for external human influences. The recovery from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 also contributed to the slowdown in GMST trends. Our results suggest that a slowdown in GMST trends could have been predicted in advance, and that future reduction of anthropogenic aerosol emissions, particularly from China, would promote a positive PDO and increased GMST trends over the coming years. Furthermore, the overestimation of the magnitude of recent warming by models is substantially reduced by using detection and attribution analysis to rescale their response to external factors, especially cooling following volcanic eruptions. Improved understanding of external influences on climate is therefore crucial to constrain near-term climate predictions.},

Internal climate variability, for example, is an inherent uncertainty in the climate system that is undersampled by the multimodel ensembles used in most climate impacts research. Because of this, decision makers are left with the question of whether the range of climate projections across models is due to structural model choices, thus requiring more scientific investment to constrain, or instead is a set of equally plausible outcomes consistent with the same warming world. Similarly, many questions faced by scientists require a clear separation of model uncertainty and that arising from internal variability. With this as motivation and the renewed attention to large ensembles given planning for Phase 7 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP7), we illustrate the scientific and policy value of the attribution and quantification of uncertainty from initial condition large ensembles, particularly when analyzed in conjunction with multimodel ensembles. We focus on how large ensembles can support regional-scale robust adaptation decision-making in ways multimodel ensembles alone cannot. We also acknowledge several recently identified problems associated with large ensembles, namely, that they are (1) resource intensive, (2) redundant, and (3) biased. Despite these challenges, we show, using examples from hydroclimate, how large ensembles provide unique information for the scientific and policy communities and can be analyzed appropriately for regional-scale climate impacts research to help inform risk management in a warming world.},

Here we use a multivariate approach1,2 to identify two distinct externally forced fingerprints from multiple ensembles of Earth system model simulations. The leading fingerprint, FM1(x), is characterized by global warming, intensified wet–dry patterns3 and progressive large-scale continental aridification, largely driven by multidecadal increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The second fingerprint, FM2(x), captures a pronounced interhemispheric temperature contrast4,5, associated meridional shifts in the intertropical convergence zone6–9 and correlated anomalies in precipitation and aridity over California10, the Sahel11,12 and India. FM2(x) exhibits nonlinear temporal behaviour: the intertropical convergence zone moves southwards before 1975 in response to increases in hemispherically asymmetric sulfate aerosol emissions, and it shifts northwards after 1975 due to reduced sulfur dioxide emissions and the GHG-induced warming of Northern Hemisphere landmasses. Both fingerprints are statistically identifiable in observations of joint changes in temperature, rainfall and aridity during 1950–2014. We show that the reliable simulation of these changes requires combined forcing by GHGs, direct and indirect effects of aerosols, and large volcanic eruptions. Our results suggest that GHG-induced aridification may be modulated regionally by future reductions in sulfate aerosol emissions.},

We show that three distinct periods are identifiable in climate models, observations and reconstructions during the twentieth century. In recent decades (1981 to present), the signal of greenhouse gas forcing is present but not yet detectable at high confidence. Observations and reconstructions differ significantly from an expected pattern of greenhouse gas forcing around mid-century (1950–1975), coinciding with a global increase in aerosol forcing. In the first half of the century (1900–1949), however, a signal of greenhouse-gas-forced change is robustly detectable. Multiple observational datasets and reconstructions using data from tree rings confirm that human activities were probably affecting the worldwide risk of droughts as early as the beginning of the twentieth century.},

Aside from the warming trend itself, this has broader implications, e.g. atmospheric circulation trends depend on latitudinal temperature gradients. In this study, tropical temperature trends in the CMIP6 models are examined, from 1979 to 2014, and contrasted with trends from the RICH/RAOBCORE radiosondes, and the ERA5/5.1 reanalysis. As in earlier studies, we find considerable warming biases in the CMIP6 modeled trends, and we show that these biases are linked to biases in surface temperature. We also uncover previously undocumented biases in the lower-middle stratosphere: the CMIP6 models appear unable to capture the time evolution of stratospheric cooling, which is non-monotonic owing to the Montreal Protocol. Finally, using models with large ensembles, we show that their standard deviation in tropospheric temperature trends, which is due to internal variability alone, explains ∼ 50% (± 20%) of that from the CMIP6 models.},

   abstract = {The equilibrium response of atmospheric circulation to the direct radiative effects of natural or anthropogenic aerosols is investigated using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3) coupled to two different ocean boundary conditions: prescribed climatological sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and a slab ocean model. Anthropogenic and natural aerosols significantly affect the circulation but in nearly opposite ways, because anthropogenic aerosols tend to have a net local warming effect and natural aerosols a net cooling. Aerosol forcings shift the Intertropical Convergence Zone and alter the strength of the Hadley circulation as found in previous studies, but also affect the Hadley cell width. These effects are due to meridional gradients in warming caused by heterogeneous net heating, and are stronger with interactive SST. Aerosols also drive model responses at high latitudes, including polar near-surface warming by anthropogenic aerosols in summer and an Arctic Oscillation (AO)-type responses in winter: anthropogenic aerosols strengthen wintertime zonal wind near 60°N, weaken it near 30°N, warm the troposphere, cool the stratosphere, and reduce Arctic surface pressure, while natural aerosols produce nearly opposite changes. These responses are shown to be due to modulation of stratospheric wave-driving consistent with meridional forcing gradients in midlatitudes. They are more pronounced when SST is fixed, apparently because the contrast in land-ocean heating drives a predominantly wavenumber-2 response in the northern hemisphere which is more efficient in reaching the stratosphere, showing that zonal heating variations also affect this particular response. The results suggest that recent shifts from reflecting to absorbing aerosol types probably contributed to the observed decadal variations in tropical width and AO, although studies with more realistic temporal variations in forcing would be needed to quantify this contribution. © 2010 The Author(s).},

In coupled historical single-forcing simulations, aerosol forcing induces a deceleration of both the subpolar jet (SPJ) and the subtropical jet (STJ) in SH in austral winter. Atmospheric general circulation model experiments indicate that the STJ is weakened by an interhemisphere gradient in the zonal mean sea surface temperature (SST) and an anomalous cross-equatorial Hadley circulation, while the SPJ response shares similar feedbacks with the greenhouse gas forcing. Specifically, atmospheric eddy adjustments are important for the SPJ change. The atmospheric response unique to anthropogenic aerosol forcing (e.g., cross-equatorial Hadley cell and the weakened SH STJ) can be exploited for climate change attribution.},

Here, analyzing state-of-the-art climate models and observations, we show that the recent North Atlantic warming hole is of anthropogenic origin.

Five ensemble members are run for each of five aerosol scaling factors. Decadal variations in surface temperatures are strongly sensitive to aerosol forcing, particularly between 1950 and 1980. Post-1980, trends are dominated by greenhouse gas forcing, with much lower sensitivity to aerosol emission differences. Most realizations with aerosol forcing more negative than about –1 Wm–2 simulate stronger cooling trends in the mid-20th century compared with observations, while the simulated warming post-1980 always exceeds observed warming, likelydue to a warm bias in the transient climate response in HadGEM3-GC3.1.},

   abstract = {Abstract. The Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to a doubling of atmospheric CO2, along with the transient climate response (TCR) and greenhouse gas emissions pathways, determines the amount of future warming. Coupled climate models have in the past been important tools to estimate and understand ECS. ECS estimated from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models lies between 2.0 and 4.7 K (mean of 3.2 K), whereas in the latest CMIP6 the spread has increased to 1.8–5.5 K (mean of 3.7 K), with 5 out of 25 models exceeding 5 K. It is thus pertinent to understand the causes underlying this shift. Here we compare the CMIP5 and CMIP6 model ensembles and find a systematic shift between CMIP eras to be unexplained as a process of random sampling from modeled forcing and feedback distributions. Instead, shortwave feedbacks shift towards more positive values, in particular over the Southern Ocean, driving the shift towards larger ECS values in many of the models. These results suggest that changes in model treatment of mixed-phase cloud processes and changes to Antarctic sea ice representation are likely causes of the shift towards larger ECS. Somewhat surprisingly, CMIP6 models exhibit less historical warming than CMIP5 models, despite an increase in TCR between CMIP eras (mean TCR increased from 1.7 to 1.9 K). The evolution of the warming suggests, however, that several of the CMIP6 models apply too strong aerosol cooling, resulting in too weak mid-20th century warming compared to the instrumental record.},

   abstract = {For the current generation of earth system models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), the range of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS, a hypothetical value of global warming at equilibrium for a doubling of CO2) is 1.8°C to 5.6°C, the largest of any generation of models dating to the 1990s. Meanwhile, the range of transient climate response (TCR, the surface temperature warming around the time of CO2 doubling in a 1% per year CO2 increase simulation) for the CMIP6 models of 1.7°C (1.3°C to 3.0°C) is only slightly larger than for the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. Here we review and synthesize the latest developments in ECS and TCR values in CMIP, compile possible reasons for the current values as supplied by the modeling groups, and highlight future directions. Cloud feedbacks and cloud-aerosol interactions are the most likely contributors to the high values and increased range of ECS in CMIP6.},

   abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance in complex machine learning tasks such as image classification or speech recognition. However, due to their multilayer nonlinear structure, they are not transparent, i.e., it is hard to grasp what makes them arrive at a particular classification or recognition decision, given a new unseen data sample. Recently, several approaches have been proposed enabling one to understand and interpret the reasoning embodied in a DNN for a single test image. These methods quantify the 'importance' of individual pixels with respect to the classification decision and allow a visualization in terms of a heatmap in pixel/input space. While the usefulness of heatmaps can be judged subjectively by a human, an objective quality measure is missing. In this paper, we present a general methodology based on region perturbation for evaluating ordered collections of pixels such as heatmaps. We compare heatmaps computed by three different methods on the SUN397, ILSVRC2012, and MIT Places data sets. Our main result is that the recently proposed layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively provides a better explanation of what made a DNN arrive at a particular classification decision than the sensitivity-based approach or the deconvolution method. We provide theoretical arguments to explain this result and discuss its practical implications. Finally, we investigate the use of heatmaps for unsupervised assessment of the neural network performance.},

   abstract = {A lower-bound on the uncertainty in observational estimates of the aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE, the direct interaction with solar radiation by all aerosols), and the aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF, the radiative effect of just anthropogenic aerosols, RFari), is quantified by making the optimistic assumption that global aerosol observations can be made with the accuracy found in the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun photometer retrievals. The global mean all-sky aerosol DRE uncertainty was found to be 1.1 Wm-2 (1 standard deviation). The global mean all-sky aerosol DRF (RFari) uncertainty was determined to be 0.31 Wm-2. The total uncertainty in both quantities is dominated by contributions from the aerosol single scattering albedo uncertainty. These uncertainty estimates were compared to a literature survey of mostly satellite-based aerosol DRE/DRF values. Comparisons to previous studies reveal that most have significantly underestimated the aerosol DRE uncertainty. Past estimates of the aerosol DRF uncertainty are smaller (on average) than our optimistic observational estimates, including the aerosol DRF uncertainty given in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report (AR5). This disconnect between our observation-based uncertainty and that found in past aerosol DRF studies that rely, at least in part, on modeling is discussed. Also quantified is a potential reduction in the current observational uncertainty possible with a future generation of satellite observations that would leverage aerosol typing and more refined vertical information.},

Its emergence has been linked to a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which leads to a reduced ocean heat transport into the warming hole region. Here we show that, in addition to the reduced low-latitude heat import, increased ocean heat transport out of the region into higher latitudes and a shortwave cloud feedback dominate the formation and temporal evolution of the warming hole under greenhouse gas forcing. In climate model simulations of the historical period, the low-latitude Atlantic meridional overturning circulation decline does not emerge from natural variability, whereas the accelerating heat transport to higher latitudes is clearly attributable to anthropogenic forcing. Both the overturning and the gyre circulation contribute to the increased high-latitude ocean heat transport, and therefore are critical to understand the past and future evolutions of the warming hole.},

Here, we show that the multimodel mean AMOC strengthened by approximately 10% from 1850–1985 in new simulations from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), a larger change than was seen in CMIP5. Across the models, the strength of the AMOC trend up to 1985 is related to a proxy for the strength of the aerosol forcing. Therefore, the multimodel difference is a result of stronger anthropogenic aerosol forcing on average in CMIP6 than CMIP5, which is primarily due to more models including aerosol-cloud interactions. However, observational constraints—including a historical sea surface temperature fingerprint and shortwave radiative forcing in recent decades—suggest that anthropogenic forcing and/or the AMOC response may be overestimated.},

Despite the potential benefits of cropping systems diversity, few farmers in the US Corn Belt use diverse rotations. This study examines factors that may influence farmers’ decisions to use more diversified crop rotations in the US Corn Belt through a parallel convergent mixed methods approach, using a multi-level analysis of Corn Belt farmer survey data (n = 4,778) and in-depth interviews (n = 159). Analyses were conducted to answer questions regarding what factors influence farmers’ use of extended crop rotations in intensive corn-based cropping systems and to explore whether farmers in the Corn Belt might use extended crop rotations in response to climatic changes. Findings suggest that path dependency associated with the intensive corn-based cropping system in the region limits farmers’ ability to integrate more diverse crop rotations. However, farmers in more diversified watersheds, those who farm marginal land, and those with livestock are more likely to use extended rotations. Additionally, farmers who currently use more diverse rotations are also more likely to plan to use crop rotations as a climate change adaptation strategy. If more diverse cropping systems are desired to reduce climate risks, in addition to reducing the negative impacts associated with industrial agricultural production, then further efforts must be made to facilitate more diverse crop rotations in the U.S. Corn Belt. This may be achieved by adjusting policy and economic incentives that presently discourage cropping system diversity in the region.},

We investigated the cultural context surrounding the use of perennial cover types-such as stream buffers, wetlands, cellulosic bioenergy stocks, and diverse cropping rotations-to restore water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem function within a Corn Belt agricultural mosaic in Iowa, USA. Through ethnographic techniques and 33 in-depth interviews, we examined what was most important to rural stakeholders about their countryside. We then used photo elicitation to probe how interviewees' assessments of farm practices involving perennial cover types were related to their sense of place. Our interviewees perceived their rural "countryside" as a linked social and biophysical entity, identifying strongly with the farming lifestyle and with networks of people across the landscape. While most interviewees approved of perennial farm practices on marginal agricultural land, implementation of these practices was neither a priority nor strongly assimilated into rural experience and ethics. We identified three scale boundaries in our interviewees' perception of place which present key challenges and opportunities for landscape change: landscape-community, individual-community, and community-institution. In all cases, community social norms and networks-exhibited at landscape spatial scales-may be instrumental in bridging these boundaries and enabling networks of perennial cover types that span privately owned and operated farms. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

Adaptive strategies are evaluated in the context of decision making and farmers’ intention to increase their use of three production practices promoted across the Corn Belt: no-till farming, cover crops, and tile drainage. This paper also provides a novel conceptual framework that bridges a typology of adaptation with concepts that help predict intentionality in behavior change models. This conceptual framework was developed to facilitate examination of adaptive decision making in the context of agriculture. This research effort examines key factors that influence farmers’ intentions to increase their use of the practices evaluated given a climate change scenario. Twenty-two covariates are examined across three models developed for no-till farming, cover crops, and tile drainage. Findings highlight that farmers who believed they should adjust their practices to protect their farm from the negative impacts of increased weather variability were more likely to indicate that they would increase their use of each of the practices in response to climate change. Additionally, visiting with other farmers to observe their practices was positively associated with farmers’ intentions to increase their use of the adaptive strategies examined. Farmers who were currently using no-till farming, cover crops, and tile drainage were also more likely to plan to increase their use of these practices in response to increased weather variability associated with climate change. However, farmers who reported high levels of confidence in their current practices were less likely to plan on changing their use of these practices in response to climatic changes.},

   abstract = {The states of Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming comprise the Northern Great Plains region of the USA. The soil and water resources contained in this region have historically supported highly diverse and productive agriculture enterprises that provide a significant proportion of the food, feed, and oilseed for the nation. The region also provides ecological services that influence air, water, and soil quality along with biological diversity. Combined with livestock production and a biofuel industry, crop production forms an integrated system that can offer producers flexibility in management decisions. Projected climatic changes for this region include increasing atmospheric CO2, a longer, warmer growing season, and increased precipitation, likely received in more frequent extreme events. These changes will impact soil and water resources in the region and create opportunities and challenges for land managers. The objectives of this paper are to describe anticipated impacts of projected mid-(2050) and late-(2085) climatic changes on crop production systems in the Northern Great Plains and provide adaptation strategies that should be developed to take advantage of positive and mitigate negative changes. Projected climatic changes will influence agricultural productivity directly as well as indirectly due to changes in weed pressure, insect populations, and diseases. A warmer, longer growing season will change the crops and distribution of those crops grown within the region. An increase in the number of extreme temperature events (high daytime highs or nighttime lows) will decrease crop yields due to increased plant stress during critical pollination and grain fill periods. Adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability of soil and water resources to projected climatic changes include increasing cropping intensity, reducing tillage intensity, and use of cover crops to provide surface cover to reduce erosion potential and improve nutrient and water use efficiency. Increased use of perennial forages, crop residue, and failed crops in integrated crop-livestock systems will add biological diversity and provide options for converting vegetation biomass into animal protein. Socio-economic changes will need to be incorporated into adaptation strategies planning to insure that sustaining ecosystem services and meeting desired production and conservation goals is accomplished. Education and extension services will be needed to transfer adaptive knowledge in a timely manner to producers in the field.},

Eight focus groups with 53 Michigan farmers were conducted in 2011-12 to better understand the following: 1) what do farmers think about the relationship between climate change and agriculture, 2) what differentiates normal weather-related management from climate change adaptation actions, and 3) how do farmers understand the term "climate change adaptation." Farmers expressed skepticism at global climate change yet conveyed specific details about the local changes in climate they are experiencing on their farms. They were not able to clearly define the term "climate change adaptation" but did note specific adaptive actions they have already implemented. The farmers explained that nonclimate factors were of more concern to them when making management decisions, and they showed reactive (not proactive) actions toward adaptation. Farmers noted that any action they take has to address their specific situation, suggesting that generalized adaptation actions and language might not resonate with them. Building on quantitative surveys conducted by others, the findings in this paper contribute to ongoing efforts to more effectively assess farmers' perceptions related to climate change adaptation and to use that understanding to promote education, outreach, research, and public policies to more proactively address the consequences posed by climate change.},

In contrast with previous statistical evidence, we directly elicit an important role of water stress in explaining historical yields.

For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.” The last few years have also seen record-breaking, climate-related weather extremes, the three warmest years on record for the globe, and continued decline in arctic sea ice. These trends are expected to continue in the future over climate (multidecadal) timescales. Significant advances have also been made in our understanding of extreme weather events and how they relate to increasing global temperatures and associated climate changes. Since 1980, the cost of extreme events for the United States has exceeded $1.1 trillion; therefore, better understanding of the frequency and severity of these events in the context of a changing climate is warranted. Periodically taking stock of the current state of knowledge about climate change and putting new weather extremes, changes in sea ice, increases in ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification into context ensures that rigorous, scientifically-based information is available to inform dialogue and decisions at every level. This climate science report serves as the climate science foundation of the NCA4 and is generally intended for those who have a technical background in climate science. In this Executive Summary, gray boxes present highlights of the main report. These are followed by related points and selected figures providing more scientific details. The summary material on each topic presents the most salient points of chapter findings and therefore represents only a subset of the report’s content. For more details, the reader is referred to the individual chapters. This report discusses climate trends and findings at several scales: global, nationwide for the United States, and for ten specific U.S. regions (shown in Figure 1 in the Guide to the Report). A statement of scientific confidence also follows each point in the Executive Summary. The confidence scale is described in the Guide to the Report. At the end of the Executive Summary and in Chapter 1: Our Globally Changing Climate, there is also a summary box highlighting the most notable advances and topics since NCA3 and since the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report.},

This information is needed to inform decisions regarding the diversity and magnitude of future climate impacts and explore how mitigation and adaptation actions might affect these risks. Here, we summarize results from sectoral impact models applied within a consistent modelling framework to project how climate change will affect 22 impact sectors of the United States, including effects on human health, infrastructure and agriculture. The results show complex patterns of projected changes across the country, with damages in some sectors (for example, labour, extreme temperature mortality and coastal property) estimated to range in the hundreds of billions of US dollars annually by the end of the century under high emissions. Inclusion of a large number of sectors shows that there are no regions that escape some mix of adverse impacts. Lower emissions, and adaptation in relevant sectors, would result in substantial economic benefits.},

   abstract = {Evidence-based responses to climate change by society require operational and sustained information including biophysical indicator systems that provide up-to-date measures of trends and patterns against historical baselines. Two key components linking anthropogenic climate change to impacts on socio-ecological systems are the periodic inter- and intra-annual variations in physical climate systems (seasonality) and in plant and animal life cycles (phenology). We describe a set of national indicators that reflect sub-seasonal to seasonal drivers and responses of terrestrial physical and biological systems to climate change and variability at the national scale. Proposed indicators and metrics include seasonality of surface climate conditions (e.g., frost and freeze dates and durations), seasonality of freeze/thaw in freshwater systems (e.g., timing of stream runoff and durations of lake/river ice), seasonality in ecosystem disturbances (e.g., wildfire season timing and duration), seasonality in vegetated land surfaces (e.g., green-up and brown-down of landscapes), and seasonality of organismal life-history stages (e.g., timings of bird migration). Recommended indicators have strong linkages to variable and changing climates, include abiotic and biotic responses and feedback mechanisms, and are sufficiently simple to facilitate communication to broad audiences and stakeholders interested in understanding and adapting to climate change.},

U.S. Great Plains, due to its significance in national food production, evident climate variability, and extensive irrigation is an ideal region of investigation for climate impacts on food production. This paper evaluates climate impacts on maize, sorghum, and soybean yields and effect of irrigation for individual counties in this region by employing extensive crop yield and climate datasets from 1968-2013. Variability in crop yields was a quarter of the regional average yields, with a quarter of this variability explained by climate variability, and temperature and precipitation explained these in singularity or combination at different locations. Observed temperature trend was beneficial for maize yields, but detrimental for sorghum and soybean yields, whereas observed precipitation trend was beneficial for all three crops. Irrigated yields demonstrated increased robustness and an effective mitigation strategy against climate impacts than their non-irrigated counterparts by a considerable fraction. The information, data, and maps provided can serve as an assessment guide for planners, managers, and policy- and decision makers to prioritize agricultural resilience efforts and resource allocation or re-allocation in the regions that exhibit risk from climate variability.},

   abstract = {Seasonal transitions from winter to spring impact a wide variety of ecological and physical systems. While the effects of early springs across North America are widely documented, changes in their frequency and likelihood under the combined influences of climate change and natural variability are poorly understood. Extremely early springs, such as March 2012, can lead to severe economical losses and agricultural damage when these are followed by hard freeze events. Here we use the new Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble project and Extended Spring Indices to simulate historical and future spring onsets across the United States and in the particular the Great Lakes region. We found a marked increase in the frequency of March 2012-like springs by midcentury in addition to an overall trend towards earlier spring onsets, which nearly doubles that of observational records. However, changes in the date of last freeze do not occur at the same rate, therefore, causing a potential increase in the threat of plant tissue damage. Although large-scale climate modes, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, have previously dominated decadal to multidecadal spring onset trends, our results indicate a decreased role in natural climate variability and hence a greater forced response by the end of the century for modulating trends. Without a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, our study suggests that years like 2012 in the US could become normal by mid-century.},

   abstract = {Diverse, severe, and location-specific impacts on agricultural production are anticipated with climate change. The last IPCC report indicates that the rise of CO<inf>2</inf> and associated “greenhouse” gases could lead to a 1.4 to 5.8 °C increase in global surface temperatures, with subsequent consequences on precipitation frequency and amounts. Temperature and water availability remain key factors in determining crop growth and productivity; predicted changes in these factors will lead to reduced crop yields. Climate-induced changes in insect pest, pathogen and weed population dynamics and invasiveness could compound such effects. Undoubtedly, climate- and weather-induced instability will affect levels of and access to food supply, altering social and economic stability and regional competiveness. Adaptation is considered a key factor that will shape the future severity of climate change impacts on food production. Changes that will not radically modify the monoculture nature of dominant agroecosystems may moderate negative impacts temporarily. The biggest and most durable benefits will likely result from more radical agroecological measures that will strengthen the resilience of farmers and rural communities, such as diversification of agroecosytems in the form of polycultures, agroforestry systems, and crop-livestock mixed systems accompanied by organic soil management, water conservation and harvesting, and general enhancement of agrobiodiversity. Traditional farming systems are repositories of a wealth of principles and measures that can help modern agricultural systems become more resilient to climatic extremes. Many of these agroecological strategies that reduce vulnerabilities to climate variability include crop diversification, maintaining local genetic diversity, animal integration, soil organic management, water conservation and harvesting, etc. Understanding the agroecological features that underlie the resilience of traditional agroecosystems is an urgent matter, as they can serve as the foundation for the design of adapted agricultural systems. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events (hurricanes and droughts) in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to farms with increased levels of biodiversity. Field surveys and results reported in the literature suggest that agroecosystems are more resilient when inserted in a complex landscape matrix, featuring adapted local germplasm deployed in diversified cropping systems managed with organic matter rich soils and water conservation-harvesting techniques. The identification of systems that have withstood climatic events recently or in the past and understanding the agroecological features of such systems that allowed them to resist and/or recover from extreme events is of increased urgency, as the derived resiliency principles and practices that underlie successful farms can be disseminated to thousands of farmers via Campesino a Campesino networks to scale up agroecological practices that enhance the resiliency of agroecosystems. The effective diffusion of agroecological technologies will largely determine how well and how fast farmers adapt to climate change.},

This study addresses Midwestern U.S. crop farmers’ beliefs about climate change, perceived risks from weather and climate, and attitudes toward adaptation that influence their decisions to adopt adaptation strategies. Analyzing a 2012 survey of nearly 5000 corn farmers across 22 Midwestern U.S. Watersheds, we investigate the most common weather and climate risk management strategies, including purchasing additional crop insurance, implementing conservation practices, and adding new technology. U.S. farmers’ belief in anthropogenic climate change, perceptions of changing weather patterns, climate risks to their farm and attitudes toward adapting are analyzed. Farmers’ perceptions of risk to their own farm, attitudes toward innovation and adaptation attitudes were the most important determinants of adaptation. This study highlights the critical role of risk perceptions in adaptation attitudes as well as behaviors among agriculturalists. Finally, we discuss how these findings could be applied to increase uptake of adaptation strategies and thus resilience of U.S. agriculture to a changing climate.},

A few key studies have delineated synoptic maps of the Corn Belt boundaries going back to the early 20th century, but a modern flexible and accessible framework for mapping the Corn Belt in space and time is needed. New tools provide reference maps for the Corn Belt in the 21st century and the ability to quantify space-time changes in corn cropping patterns. The Landuse and Agricultural Management Practices web-Service (LAMPS) was used to estimate the average corn (maize, Zea mays L.) area in each county of the contiguous 48 USA states for the years 2010–2016. LAMPS provides a modified areal Fraction of corn (Fc) used to map the Corn Belt at three intensity levels, for example. The resulting patterns illustrate a mostly contiguous Midwest Corn Belt surrounded by more scattered regions, including southern and eastern regions. We also mapped irrigated areas and temporal changes in Fc. Mapped patterns have the potential to help researchers study issues related to food, feed, biofuel, and water security.},

   abstract = {Heat and drought are two emerging climatic threats to the US maize and soybean production, yet their impacts on yields are collectively determined by the magnitude of climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This study quantifies the combined and separate impacts of high temperature, heat and drought stresses on the current and future US rainfed maize and soybean production and for the first time characterizes spatial shifts in the relative importance of individual stress. Crop yields are simulated using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), driven by high-resolution (12 km) dynamically downscaled climate projections for 1995–2004 and 2085–2094. Results show that maize and soybean yield losses are prominent in the US Midwest by the late 21st century under both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, and the magnitude of loss highly depends on the current vulnerability and changes in climate extremes. Elevated atmospheric CO2 partially but not completely offsets the yield gaps caused by climate extremes, and the effect is greater in soybean than in maize. Our simulations suggest that drought will continue to be the largest threat to US rainfed maize production under RCP4.5 and soybean production under both RCP scenarios, whereas high temperature and heat stress take over the dominant stress of drought on maize under RCP8.5. We also reveal that shifts in the geographic distributions of dominant stresses are characterized by the increase in concurrent stresses, especially for the US Midwest. These findings imply the importance of considering heat and drought stresses simultaneously for future agronomic adaptation and mitigation strategies, particularly for breeding programs and crop management. The modeling framework of partitioning the total effects of climate change into individual stress impacts can be applied to the study of other crops and agriculture systems.},

   abstract = {Accurate representation of crop responses to climate is critically important to understand impacts of climate change and variability in food systems. We use Random Forest (RF), a diagnostic machine learning tool, to explore the dependence of yield on climate and technology for maize, sorghum and soybean in the US plains. We analyze the period from 1980 to 2016 and use a panel of county yields and climate variables for the crop-specific developmental phases: establishment, critical window (yield potential definition) and grain filling. The RF models accounted for between 71% to 86% of the yield variance. Technology, evaluated through the time variable, accounted for approximately 20% of the yield variance and indicates that yields have steadily increased. Responses to climate confirm prior findings revealing threshold-like responses to high temperature (yield decrease sharply when maximum temperature exceed 29 C and 30 C for maize and soybean), and reveal a higher temperature tolerance for sorghum, whose yield decreases gradually as maximum temperature exceeds 32.5 C. We found that sorghum and soybean responded positively to increases in cool minimum temperatures. Maize yield exhibited a unique and negative response to low atmospheric humidity during the critical phase that encompasses flowering, as well as a strong sensitivity to extreme temperature exposure. Using maize as a benchmark, we estimate that if warming continues unabated through the first half of the 21st century, the best climatic conditions for rainfed maize and soybean production may shift from Iowa and Illinois to Minnesota and the Dakotas with possible modulation by soil productivity.},

These crops are an important component of the region’s rural economy with an estimated value of $1.8 billion in 2012. More profitable per-acre than many row crops, specialty crops also have higher production-related risks. They are generally more sensitive to climatic stressors and require more comprehensive management compared to traditional row crops. Temperature and precipitation fluctuations across the Midwest directly impact specialty crop production quantity and quality and indirectly influence the timing of crucial farm operations and the economic impacts of pests, weeds, and diseases. Increasingly variable weather and climate change pose a serious threat to specialty crop production in the Midwest. In this article, we assess how climate variability and observed climatic trends are impacting Midwestern specialty crop production using USDA Risk Management Agency data. In addition, we review current trends in grower perceptions of risks associated with a changing climate and assess sustainable adaptation strategies. Our results indicate that weather-induced losses vary by state with excessive moisture resulting in the highest total number of claims across all Midwestern states followed by freeze and drought events. Overall, specialty crop growers are aware of the increased production risk under a changing climate and have identified the need for crop-specific weather, production, and financial risk management tools and increased crop insurance coverage.},

We present an overview of MPI-GE, its components, and detail the experiments completed. We demonstrate how to separate the forced response from internal variability in a large ensemble. This separation allows the quantification of both the forced signal under climate change and the internal variability to unprecedented precision. We then demonstrate multiple ways to evaluate MPI-GE and put observations in the context of a large ensemble, including a novel approach for comparing model internal variability with estimated observed variability. Finally, we present four novel analyses, which can only be completed using a large ensemble. First, we address whether temperature and precipitation have a pathway dependence using the forcing scenarios. Second, the forced signal of the highly noisy atmospheric circulation is computed, and different drivers are identified to be important for the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions. Third, we use the ensemble dimension to investigate the time dependency of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation variability changes under global warming. Last, sea level pressure is used as an example to demonstrate how MPI-GE can be utilized to estimate the ensemble size needed for a given scientific problem and provide insights for future ensemble projects.},

The dominant discriminants of twentieth-century variations in surface temperature exhibit large-scale warming in which, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere summer months, localized cooling is embedded. The structure of the large-scale warming is consistent with expected effects of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations. The localized cooling, with maxima on scales of 1000-2000 km over East Asia, eastern Europe, and North America, is suggestive of radiative effects of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols.},

   abstract = {Recent observed climate trends result from a combination of external radiative forcing and internally generated variability. To better contextualize these trends and forecast future ones, it is necessary to properly model the spatiotemporal properties of the internal variability. Here, a statistical model is developed for terrestrial temperature and precipitation, and global sea level pressure, based upon monthly gridded observational datasets that span 1921-2014. The model is used to generate a synthetic ensemble, each member of which has a unique sequence of internal variability but with statistical properties similar to the observational record. This synthetic ensemble is combined with estimates of the externally forced response from climate models to produce an observational large ensemble (OBS-LE). The 1000 members of the OBS-LE display considerable diversity in their 50-yr regional climate trends, indicative of the importance of internal variability on multidecadal time scales. For example, unforced atmospheric circulation trends associated with the northern annular mode can induce winter temperature trends over Eurasia that are comparable in magnitude to the forced trend over the past 50 years. Similarly, the contribution of internal variability to winter precipitation trends is large across most of the globe, leading to substantial regional uncertainties in the amplitude and, in some cases, the sign of the 50-yr trend. The OBS-LE provides a real-world counterpart to initial-condition model ensembles. The approach could be expanded to using paleo-proxy data to simulate longer-term variability.},

   abstract = {Tropospheric aerosol radiative forcing has persisted for many years as one of the major causes of uncertainty in global climate model simulations. To sample the range of plausible aerosol and atmospheric states and perform robust statistical analyses of the radiative forcing, it is important to account for the combined effects of many sources of model uncertainty, which is rarely done due to the high computational cost. This paper describes the designs of two ensembles of the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environment Model-U.K. Chemistry and Aerosol global climate model and provides the first analyses of the uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing and their causes. The first ensemble was designed to comprehensively sample uncertainty in the aerosol state, while the other samples additional uncertainties in the physical model related to clouds, humidity, and radiation, thereby allowing an analysis of uncertainty in the aerosol effective radiative forcing. Each ensemble consists of around 200 simulations of the preindustrial and present-day atmospheres. The uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing in our ensembles is comparable to the range of estimates from multimodel intercomparison projects. The mean aerosol effective radiative forcing is −1.45 W/m2 (credible interval of −2.07 to −0.81 W/m2), which encompasses but is more negative than the −1.17 W/m2 in the 2013 Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project and −0.90 W/m2 in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. The ensembles can be used to reduce aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty by challenging them with multiple measurements as well as to isolate potential causes of multimodel differences.},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosol emissions are predicted to decline sharply throughout the 21st century, in line with climate change and air quality mitigation policies, causing a near-term warming of climate that will impact our trajectory towards 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures. However, the persistent uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing limits our understanding of how much the global mean temperature will respond to near-term reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions. We quantify the model and scenario uncertainty in global mean aerosol radiative forcing up to 2050 using statistical emulation of a perturbed parameter ensemble for emission reduction scenarios consistent with three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. We then use a simple climate model to translate the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing into uncertainty in global mean temperature projections, accounting additionally for the potential correlation of aerosol radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. Near-term aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty alone causes an uncertainty window of around 5 years (2034-2039) on the projected year of exceeding a global temperature rise of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures for a middle of the road emissions scenario (SSP2-RCP4.5). A correlation between aerosol radiative forcing and climate sensitivity would increase the 1.5 °C exceedance window by many years. The results highlight the importance of quantifying aerosol radiative forcing and any relationship with climate sensitivity in climate models in order to reduce uncertainty in temperature projections.},

   abstract = {P revious studies regarding connections between the Atlantic and Pacific basins often focused on the Walker circulation through the atmosphere, with the Atlantic driving the Pacific 1-5 , the Atlantic driving global decadal variability 6 , the Pacific driving the Atlantic 7-9 or the Atlantic affecting the Pacific via the tropical Indian Ocean 10. These influences are typically invoked for the tropics 11 , although other connections through the midlati-tudes have also been proposed 3,11 with interaction between Pacific and Atlantic decadal variability possibly important for midlatitude teleconnections 12. Two-way interactions between the Atlantic and Pacific have been reviewed for interannual timescales 11 , and for observations on decadal timescales 13 , although the short data record for the latter did not allow an analysis of the mechanisms involved. The tropical Atlantic forcing of the tropical Pacific via the anomalous Walker circulation is seen on both interannual and decadal timescales as noted by studies cited in the preceding. However, a major difference on the decadal timescale, which we address in this paper, is that convective heating anomalies in the tropical eastern Pacific, which have been shown to play roles in decadal-timescale Arctic and Antarctic sea ice responses through the Pacific-North American (PNA) and Pacific-South American (PSA) telecon-nection patterns, respectively 14-16 , also end up affecting the tropical North and South Atlantic. Since these processes are acting on decadal timescales, as opposed to the interannual timescale, the responses go beyond single seasons as in the interannual case 11. In addition, external forcings play a greater role on the decadal timescales shown here. Idealized pacemaker experiments For Pacific decadal variability positive phase (PDV+) minus PDV−, assuming approximate linearity of the interbasin connections, the specified SST pattern in the Pacific (Methods) is characterized by positive SST anomalies of over +0.5 °C over most of the tropical Pacific representing the positive PDV phase (Fig. 1a). There are statistically significant positive (same-sign) SST anomalies of several tenths of a degree over most of the tropical Atlantic (Fig. 1a) with significant positive precipitation anomalies that cover most of the Pacific tropics (Fig. 1b, values of around +0.4 mm d −1). There are mostly positive precipitation anomalies between about 30° N and 30° S in the Atlantic and a narrow band of negative anomalies near 20° S (Fig. 1b) with values of about ±0.2 mm d −1. For specified positive Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV+ minus AMV−), the tropical Pacific shows opposite-sign (nega-tive) SST anomalies with values of around −0.2 °C (Fig. 1c) that are roughly half the amplitude of the specified PDV pattern in Fig. 1a. Corresponding precipitation anomalies (Fig. 1d) are positive over much of the specified positive SST regions in the tropical Atlantic (values of over about +0.4 mm d −1) and negative (around −0.2 mm d −1) over most of the tropical Pacific. The large-scale east-west Walker circulation in the atmosphere connects the basins in the pacemaker experiments with enhanced vertical motion over tropical ocean regions with positive SST anomalies and anomalous descent to the east and west (Fig. 1e,f). Thus, for PDV+ minus PDV−, stronger upward vertical motion over the eastern tropical Pacific is associated with weaker Pacific trade winds (westerly anomaly winds in the lower troposphere), anomalous descent over the tropical Atlantic and Maritime Continent and upper-level outflow away from the enhanced vertical motion in the tropical Pacific (Fig. 1e). Similarly for the AMV+ minus AMV-, enhanced vertical motion over the tropical Atlantic is associated with outflow near 200 hPa to the west (easterly anomaly winds) and anomalous descent over the tropical Pacific with trade-wind acceleration there (easterly anomaly winds in the lower troposphere, Fig. 1f). Decadal climate prediction presumes there are decadal-timescale processes and mechanisms that, if initialized properly in models, potentially provide predictive skill more than one or two years into the future. Candidate mechanisms involve Pacific decadal variability and Atlantic multidecadal variability, elements of which involve slow fluctuations of tropical Pacific and Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from positive anomalies (positive phase) to negative anomalies (negative phase). Here we use model experiments to show that there tends to be a weak opposite-sign SST response in the tropical Pacific when observed SSTs are specified in the Atlantic, while there is a weak same-sign SST response in the tropical Atlantic when observed SSTs are specified in the tropical Pacific. Net surface heat flux in the Atlantic and ocean dynamics in the Pacific play contrasting roles in the ocean response to specified SSTs in the respective basins. We propose that processes in the Pacific and Atlantic are sequentially interactive through the atmospheric Walker circulation along with contributions from midlatitude teleconnections for the Atlantic response to the Pacific.

   abstract = {The Earth's climate is rapidly changing. Over the past centuries, aerosols, via their ability to absorb or scatter solar radiation and alter clouds, played an important role in counterbalancing some of the greenhouse gas (GHG) caused global warming. The multicentury anthropogenic aerosol cooling effect prevented present-day climate from reaching even higher surface air temperatures and subsequent more dramatic climate impacts. Trends in aerosol concentrations and optical depth show that in many polluted regions such as Europe and the United States, aerosol precursor emissions decreased back to levels of the 1950s. More recent polluting countries such as China may have reached a turning point in recent years as well, while India still follows an upward trend. Here we study aerosol trends in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations of the GISS ModelE2.1 climate model using a fully coupled atmosphere composition configuration, including interactive gas-phase chemistry and either an aerosol microphysical (MATRIX) or a mass-based (One-Moment Aerosol, OMA) aerosol module. Results show that whether global aerosol radiative forcing is already declining depends on the aerosol scheme used. Using the aerosol microphysical scheme, where the aerosol system reacts more strongly to the trend in sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, global peak direct aerosol forcing was reached in the 1980s, whereas the mass-based scheme simulates peak direct aerosol forcing around 2010.},

   abstract = {The effective radiative forcing, which includes the instantaneous forcing plus adjustments from the atmosphere and surface, has emerged as the key metric of evaluating human and natural influence on the climate. We evaluate effective radiative forcing and adjustments in 17 contemporary climate models that are participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and have contributed to the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP). Present-day (2014) global-mean anthropogenic forcing relative to pre-industrial (1850) levels from climate models stands at 2.00 (0:23) Wm2, comprised of 1.81 (0:09) Wm2 from CO2, 1.08 ( 0.21) Wm2 from other well-mixed greenhouse gases, 1:01 ( 0.23) Wm2 from aerosols and 0:09 (0:13) Wm2 from land use change. Quoted uncertainties are 1 standard deviation across model best estimates, and 90 confidence in the reported forcings, due to internal variability, is typically within 0.1 Wm2. The majority of the remaining 0:21Wm2 is likely to be from ozone. In most cases, the largest contributors to the spread in effective radiative forcing (ERF) is from the instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF) and from cloud responses, particularly aerosol-cloud interactions to aerosol forcing. As determined in previous studies, cancellation of tropospheric and surface adjustments means that the stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing is approximately equal to ERF for greenhouse gas forcing but not for aerosols, and consequentially, not for the anthropogenic total. The spread of aerosol forcing ranges from 0:63 to 1:37Wm2, exhibiting a less negative mean and narrower range compared to 10 CMIP5 models. The spread in 4CO2 forcing has also narrowed in CMIP6 compared to 13 CMIP5 models. Aerosol forcing is uncorrelated with climate sensitivity. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the increasing spread in climate sensitivity in CMIP6 models, particularly related to high-sensitivity models, is a consequence of a stronger negative present-day aerosol forcing and little evidence that modelling groups are systematically tuning climate sensitivity or aerosol forcing to recreate observed historical warming.},

   abstract = {Current state-of-the-art global climate models produce different values for Earth's mean temperature. When comparing simulations with each other and with observations, it is standard practice to compare temperature anomalies with respect to a reference period. It is not always appreciated that the choice of reference period can affect conclusions, both about the skill of simulations of past climate and about the magnitude of expected future changes in climate. For example, observed global temperatures over the past decade are toward the lower end of the range of the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations irrespective of what reference period is used, but exactly where they lie in the model distribution varies with the choice of reference period. Additionally, we demonstrate that projections of when particular temperature levels are reached, for example, 2 K above "preindustrial," change by up to a decade depending on the choice of reference period. In this article, we discuss some of the key issues that arise when using anomalies relative to a reference period to generate climate projections. We highlight that there is no perfect choice of reference period. When evaluating models against observations, a long reference period should generally be used, but how long depends on the quality of the observations available. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) choice to use a 1986-2005 reference period for future global temperature projections was reasonable, but a case-by-case approach is needed for different purposes and when assessing projections of different climate variables. Finally, we recommend that any studies that involve the use of a reference period should explicitly examine the robustness of the conclusions to alternative choices.},

Instead, atmospheric scientists look for specific states of the climate system that lead to more predictable behaviour than others. Here, we demonstrate how neural networks can be used, not only to leverage these states to make skillful predictions, but moreover to identify the climatic conditions that lead to enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we employ a neural network interpretability method called ``layer-wise relevance propagation'' to create heatmaps of the regions in the input most relevant for a network's output. For Earth scientists, these relevant regions for the neural network's prediction are by far the most important product of our study: they provide scientific insight into the physical mechanisms that lead to enhanced weather predictability. While we demonstrate our approach for the atmospheric science domain, this methodology is applicable to a large range of geoscientific problems.},

   abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report largely depends on simulations, predictions and projections by climate models. Most models, however, have deficiencies and biases that raise large uncertainties in their products. Over the past several decades, a tremendous effort has been made to improve model performance in the simulation of special regions and aspects of the climate system. Here we show that biases or errors in special regions can be linked with others at far away locations. We find in 22 climate models that regional sea surface temperature (SST) biases are commonly linked with the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which is characterized by the northward flow in the upper ocean and returning southward flow in the deep ocean. A simulated weak AMOC is associated with cold biases in the entire Northern Hemisphere with an atmospheric pattern that resembles the Northern Hemisphere annular mode. The AMOC weakening is also associated with a strengthening of Antarctic Bottom Water formation and warm SST biases in the Southern Ocean. It is also shown that cold biases in the tropical North Atlantic and West African/Indian monsoon regions during the warm season in the Northern Hemisphere have interhemispheric links with warm SST biases in the tropical southeastern Pacific and Atlantic, respectively. The results suggest that improving the simulation of regional processes may not suffice for overall better model performance, as the effects of remote biases may override them. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Southern Ocean mean-state circulation takes up heat while a slowdown in North Atlantic circulation acts as a feedback to slow surface warming.

A global land–ocean temperature record has been created by combining the Berkeley Earth monthly land temperature field with spatially kriged version of the HadSST3 dataset.

It includes average temperatures in 1∘×1∘ lat–long grid cells for each month when available. It provides a global mean temperature record quite similar to records from Hadley's HadCRUT4, NASA's GISTEMP, NOAA's GlobalTemp, and Cowtan and Way and provides a spatially complete and homogeneous temperature field. Two versions of the record are provided, treating areas with sea ice cover as either air temperature over sea ice or sea surface temperature under sea ice, the former being preferred for most applications. The choice of how to assess the temperature of areas with sea ice coverage has a notable impact on global anomalies over past decades due to rapid warming of air temperatures in the Arctic. Accounting for rapid warming of Arctic air suggests ∼ 0.1 ∘C additional global-average temperature rise since the 19th century than temperature series that do not capture the changes in the Arctic.

   abstract = {In this paper we examine various options for the calculation of the forced signal in climate model simulations, and the impact these choices have on the estimates of internal variability. We find that an ensemble mean of runs from a single climate model [a single model ensemble mean (SMEM)] provides a good estimate of the true forced signal even for models with very few ensemble members. In cases where only a single member is available for a given model, however, the SMEM from other models is in general out-performed by the scaled ensemble mean from all available climate model simulations [the multimodel ensemble mean (MMEM)]. The scaled MMEM may therefore be used as an estimate of the forced signal for observations. The MMEM method, however, leads to increasing errors further into the future, as the different rates of warming in the models causes their trajectories to diverge. We therefore apply the SMEM method to those models with a sufficient number of ensemble members to estimate the change in the amplitude of internal variability under a future forcing scenario. In line with previous results, we find that on average the surface air temperature variability decreases at higher latitudes, particularly over the ocean along the sea ice margins, while variability in precipitation increases on average, particularly at high latitudes. Variability in sea level pressure decreases on average in the Southern Hemisphere, while in the Northern Hemisphere there are regional differences.},

   abstract = {The frequency of climate extremes will change in response to shifts in both mean climate and climate variability. These individual contributions, and thus the fundamental mechanisms behind changes in climate extremes, remain largely unknown. Here we apply the probability ratio concept in large-ensemble climate simulations to attribute changes in extreme events to either changes in mean climate or climate variability. We show that increased occurrence of monthly high-temperature events is governed by a warming mean climate. In contrast, future changes in monthly heavy-precipitation events depend to a considerable degree on trends in climate variability. Spatial variations are substantial however, highlighting the relevance of regional processes. The contributions of mean and variability to the probability ratio are largely independent of event threshold, magnitude of warming and climate model. Hence projections of temperature extremes are more robust than those of precipitation extremes, since the mean climate is better understood than climate variability.},

A major limitation of deep models is that they are not amenable to interpretability. This limitation can be circumvented by developing post hoc techniques to explain the predictions, giving rise to the area of explainability. Recently, explainability of deep models on images and texts has achieved significant progress. In the area of graph data, graph neural networks (GNNs) and their explainability are experiencing rapid developments. However, there is neither a unified treatment of GNN explainability methods, nor a standard benchmark and testbed for evaluations. In this survey, we provide a unified and taxonomic view of current GNN explainability methods. Our unified and taxonomic treatments of this subject shed lights on the commonalities and differences of existing methods and set the stage for further methodological developments. To facilitate evaluations, we generate a set of benchmark graph datasets specifically for GNN explainability. We summarize current datasets and metrics for evaluating GNN explainability. Altogether, this work provides a unified methodological treatment of GNN explainability and a standardized testbed for evaluations.},

   abstract = {Identifying, detecting, and localizing extreme weather events is a crucial first step in understanding how they may vary under different climate change scenarios. Pattern recognition tasks such as classification, object detection , and segmentation (i.e., pixel-level classification) have remained challenging problems in the weather and climate sciences. While there exist many empirical heuristics for detecting extreme events, the disparities between the output of these different methods even for a single event are large and often difficult to reconcile. Given the success of deep learning (DL) in tackling similar problems in computer vision, we advocate a DL-based approach. DL, however, works best in the context of supervised learning-when labeled datasets are readily available. Reliable labeled training data for extreme weather and climate events is scarce. We create "ClimateNet"-an open, community-sourced human-expert-labeled curated dataset that captures tropical cyclones (TCs) and atmospheric rivers (ARs) in high-resolution climate model output from a simulation of a recent historical period. We use the curated ClimateNet dataset to train a state-of-the-art DL model for pixel-level identification -i.e., segmentation-of TCs and ARs. We then apply the trained DL model to historical and climate change scenarios simulated by the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM5.1) and show that the DL model accurately segments the data into TCs, ARs, or "the background" at a pixel level. Further, we show how the segmentation results can be used to conduct spatially and temporally precise analytics by quantifying distributions of extreme precipitation conditioned on event types (TC or AR) at regional scales. The key contribution of this work is that it paves the way for DL-based automated , high-fidelity, and highly precise analytics of climate data using a curated expert-labeled dataset-ClimateNet. ClimateNet and the DL-based segmentation method provide several unique capabilities: (i) they can be used to calculate a variety of TC and AR statistics at a fine-grained level; (ii) they can be applied to different climate scenarios and different datasets without tuning as they do not rely on threshold conditions; and (iii) the proposed DL method is suitable for rapidly analyzing large amounts of climate model output.

   abstract = {It remains difficult to disentangle the relative influences of aerosols and greenhouse gases on regional surface temperature trends in the context of global climate change. To address this issue, we use a new collection of initial-condition large ensembles from the Community Earth System Model version 1 that are prescribed with different combinations of industrial aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing. To compare the climate response to these external forcings, we adopt an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture from previous work that predicts the year by training on maps of near-surface temperature. We then utilize layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize the regional temperature signals that are important for the ANN's prediction in each climate model experiment. To mask noise when extracting only the most robust climate patterns from LRP, we introduce a simple uncertainty metric that can be adopted to other explainable artificial intelligence (AI) problems. We find that the North Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and Southeast Asia are key regions of importance for the neural network to make its prediction, especially prior to the early-21st century. Notably, we also find that the ANN predictions based on maps of observations correlate higher to the actual year after training on the large ensemble experiment with industrial aerosols held fixed to 1920 levels. This work illustrates the sensitivity of regional temperature signals to changes in aerosol forcing in historical simulations. By using explainable AI methods, we have the opportunity to improve our understanding of (non)linear combinations of anthropogenic forcings in state-of-the-art global climate models.},

   abstract = {T he positions of the storm track and the seasonal precipitation over Europe and Eastern North America are known to be linked to the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) which is the most prominent pattern of atmospheric variability over middle and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. The NAO is described as an alternation between two pressure systems, the Azores High and the Icelandic Low, which in turn influences weather conditions over large areas 1,2. The Arctic Oscillation (AO, also known as the Northern Annular Mode, NAM) has been introduced 3-5 as a hemispheric climate variability pattern characterized by a primary centre of action over the Arctic and two opposite centres of action in mid-latitudes, one over the North Pacific and the other over the North Atlantic. A negative AO is usually associated with pronounced meridional wind patterns and has been linked with the occurrence of surface extremes in the mid-latitudes 6. Despite the annular (zonally symmetric) structure that characterizes the AO, sea-level pressure (SLP) anomalies in the North Atlantic and North Pacific centres of action are not correlated 7 , suggesting that each one of them can exist independently of the other. The present-day monthly temporal correlation between AO and NAO is very high, with correlation coefficients up to 0.95 (refs. 8,9). For this reason, the NAO is often referred to as the local manifestation of the AO and the two terms have been used interchangeably (for example, refs. 6,10-12). Their variability has been shown to be affected by stratospheric anomalies: in winter, the correlation between the 90-d low pass filtered anomalies of 10 hPa and 1,000 hPa geopotential height (GPH) exceeds 0.65, when surface anomaly time series are lagged by about 3 weeks, meaning that stratospheric anomalies are good precursors to surface NAO/AO conditions 11,13. On the other hand, the stratospheric polar vortex is known to be influenced by various tropospheric phenomena, such as tropical and extratropical variability, including El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 14 , Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) 15 , the Madden-Julian tropical atmospheric oscillation (MJO) 16-18 and sea-ice or snow cover changes in the Arctic region 19-25. Enhanced air-sea fluxes and/or deep convection generate a delayed warming response in the polar stratosphere, which eventually often triggers a negative NAO/AO phase 16,21,23,26. In this study, we analyse the dependence of AO and NAO on climate mean state, showing that their correlation breaks down in a warmer climate and suggesting a sufficient condition for the change. Then, we discuss the implications of these modifications on the stratosphere-troposphere coupling. For this purpose, we analyse the results obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for the historical climate and for the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) scenario, and from simulations of an intermediate complexity model, and compare them to reanalysis data. We compare the present-day climate with the most extreme climatic scenario of RCP 8.5 during the twenty-third century. We choose this time frame to shed light on the theoretical behaviour of these coupled modes of variability and demonstrate that they can behave very differently under large climate forcing.},

   abstract = {F or more than 20 years, detection and attribution techniques have been used to identify human influence on global temperature changes and to quantify the contributions of individual forcings to observed changes 1-3. The commitment of parties to the Paris Agreement 4 to "holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels", and the Global Stocktake process, which aims to monitor progress towards the Paris Agreement goals, give new relevance to efforts to quantify human climate influence so far. While the Paris Agreement is not explicit about the meaning of either 'global average temperature' or 'pre-industrial levels' , much of the climate impacts literature on which assessment of dangerous anthropogenic interference in climate is based has used globally complete global mean near-surface air temperature (GSAT) from climate models to assess future climate impacts. Therefore, we primarily assess human influence on GSAT in this Article. Recent literature has demonstrated that, in climate models, this metric of global mean temperature warms more than blended sea surface temperatures over ocean and near-surface air temperature over land, masked with observational coverage (global mean surface temperature (GMST)) 5-7. Previous attribution studies have typically estimated attributable trends over the past 50-60 years in GMST 8 , but estimates of warming relative to pre-industrial levels are more relevant to monitoring progress towards Paris Agreement goals. While multiple possible periods over the Holocene could be chosen as pre-industrial base periods 9 , we follow the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (ref. 10 ; SR1.5) and choose 1850-1900. Comparison of global mean temperature metrics Annual means of global mean temperature anomalies in the fourth Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit Temperature (HadCRUT4) 11 dataset relative to 1850-1900 and based on an area-weighted global mean of monthly mean anomalies are shown in Fig. 1a. These are compared with global mean blended sea surface temperatures over ocean and near-surface air temperatures over land and ice masked with HadCRUT4 coverage 5 (GMST, Methods) in individual Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) 12 historical simulations merged with Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 (SSP2-4.5) 13 simulations (historical-ssp245 simulations hereafter). The simulated warming in 2010-2019 is on average 17% (5-95% ensemble range of 10%-24%) stronger in globally complete GSAT than in HadCRUT4-masked GMST (Fig. 1a) (similar to previous results based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations 14,15), demonstrating the importance of the choice of metric for assessing attributable warming. Comparing globally complete versions of GSAT and GMST, the simulated warming in GSAT is only 6% stronger (5-95% range of 2-8%). Therefore, the largest contribution to the enhanced warming in globally complete GSAT versus HadCRUT4-masked GMST comes from the observational masking. Multiplying the observed 2010-2019 warming in HadCRUT4 GMST of 0.94 °C (5-95% range of 0.90-0.99 °C, Supplementary Table 1) by the ratio of simulated warming in globally complete GSAT to HadCRUT4-masked GMST (1.17), we infer a best estimate of observed 2010-2019 warming in GSAT of 1.10 °C (5-95% range of 1.01-1.20 °C). Similar calculations using HadCRUT5 Parties to the Paris Agreement agreed to holding global average temperature increases "well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels". Monitoring the contributions of human-induced climate forcings to warming so far is key to understanding progress towards these goals. Here we use climate model simulations from the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project, as well as regularized optimal fingerprinting, to show that anthropogenic forcings caused 0.9 to 1.3 °C of warming in global mean near-surface air temperature in 2010-2019 relative to 1850-1900, compared with an observed warming of 1.1 °C. Greenhouse gases and aerosols contributed changes of 1.2 to 1.9 °C and −0.7 to −0.1 °C, respectively, and natural forcings contributed negligibly. These results demonstrate the substantial human influence on climate so far and the urgency of action needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals.

Their underlying, increasingly elaborate numerical codes produce a growing amount of raw data. Post-processing such data is therefore becoming more and more important, but also more challenging and time-consuming. In addition, visualising processed data and results has, in times of coloured figures and a wealth of half-scientific software, become one of the weakest pillars of science, widely mistreated and ignored. Efficient and automated geodynamic diagnostics and sensible scientific visualisation preventing common pitfalls is thus more important than ever. Here, a collection of numerous diagnostics for plate tectonics and mantle dynamics is provided and a case for truly scientific visualisation is made. Amongst other diagnostics are a most accurate and robust plate-boundary identification, slab-polarity recognition, plate-bending derivation, surface-topography component splitting and mantle-plume detection. Thanks to powerful image processing tools and other elaborate algorithms, these and many other insightful diagnostics are conveniently derived from only a subset of the most basic parameter fields. A brand new set of scientific quality, perceptually uniform colour maps including devon, davos, oslo and broc is introduced and made freely available (http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps, last access: 25 June 2018).

For projections of September 18 Arctic SIA change, internal variability accounts for as much as 40-60% of the total 19 uncertainty in the next decade, while emissions scenario dominates uncertainty toward 20 the end of the century. Model structure accounts for approximately 60-70% of the total 21 uncertainty by mid-century and declines to 30% at the end of the 21st century in the 22 summer months. For projections of wintertime Arctic SIA change, internal variability 23 contributes as much as 50-60% of the total uncertainty in the next decade and impacts 24 total uncertainty at longer lead times when compared to the summertime. In winter, 25 there exists a considerable scenario dependence of model uncertainty with relatively 26 larger model uncertainty under strong forcing compared to weak forcing. At regional 27 scales, the contribution of internal variability can vary widely and strongly depends on 28 the calendar month and region. For wintertime SIA change in the GIN and Barents 29 Seas, internal variability contributes approximately 60-70% to the total uncertainty 30 over the coming decades and remains important much longer than in other regions. 31 We further find that the relative contribution of internal variability to total uncertainty 32 is state-dependent and increases as sea ice volume declines. These results demonstrate 33 that internal variability is a significant source of uncertainty in projections of Arctic 34 sea ice. 35},

Using two General Circulation Models (GCMs), the ensemble size is increased up to 300 ensemble members, beyond the recommended 100 members. After partitioning the response in groups of 100-ensemble members, the reproducibility of the results is evaluated, with a focus on the response of the mid-latitude jet streams in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. Both atmosphere-only and coupled ocean-atmosphere PAMIP experiments are analyzed. Substantial differences in the mid-latitude response are found among the different experiment subsets, suggesting that 100-member ensembles are still significantly influenced by internal variability, which can mislead conclusions. Despite an overall stronger response, the coupled ocean-atmosphere runs exhibit greater spread due to additional ENSO-related internal variability when the ocean is interactive. The lack of consistency in the response is true for anomalies that are statistically significant according to Student’s-t and False Discovery Rate tests. This is problematic for the multi-model assessment of the response, as some of the spread may be attributed to different model sensitivities while it is due to internal variability. We propose a method to overcome this consistency issue, that allows for more robust conclusions when only 100 ensemble members are used.},

Reducing U MD increases confidence in projections, while U IV characterises the range of possible futures that might occur purely by chance. Separating these uncertainties is limited in traditional multi-model ensembles because most models have only a small number of realisations; furthermore, some models are not independent. Here, we use six largely independent single model initial-condition large ensembles to separate the contributions of U MD and U IV in projecting 21st-century changes of temperature, precipitation, and their temporal variability under strong forcing (RCP8.5). We provide a method that produces similar results using traditional multi-model archives. While U MD is larger than U IV for both temperature and precipitation changes, U IV is larger than U MD for the changes in temporal variability of both temperature and precipitation, between 20° and 80° latitude in both hemispheres. Over large regions and for all variables considered here except temporal temperature variability, models agree on the sign of the forced response whereas they disagree widely on the magnitude. Our separation method can readily be extended to other climate variables.},

Furthermore, the models learn from artificial datasets, often with bias or contaminated discriminating content. Through their increased distribution, decision-making algorithms can contribute promoting prejudge and unfairness which is not easy to notice due to lack of transparency. Hence, scientists developed several so-called explanators or explainers which try to point out the connection between input and output to represent in a simplified way the inner structure of machine learning black boxes. In this survey we differ the mechanisms and properties of explaining systems for Deep Neural Networks for Computer Vision tasks. We give a comprehensive overview about taxonomy of related studies and compare several survey papers that deal with explainability in general. We work out the drawbacks and gaps and summarize further research ideas.},

   abstract = {Among the statistical methods used for seasonal climate prediction, canonical correlation analysis (CCA), a more sophisticated version of the linear regression (LR) method, is well established. Recently, neural networks (NN) have been applied to seasonal climate prediction. Unlike CCA and LR, NN is a nonlinear method, which leads to the question whether the nonlinearity of NN brings any extra prediction skill. In this study, an objective comparison between the three methods (CCA, LR, and NN) in predicting the equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures (in regions Nino1+2, Nino3, Nino3.4, and Nino4) was made. The skill of NN was found to be comparable to that of LR and CCA. A cross-validated t test showed that the difference between NN and LR and the difference between NN and CCA were not significant at the 5% level. The lack of significant skill difference between the nonlinear NN method and the linear methods suggests that at the seasonal timescale the equatorial Pacific dynamics is basically linear.},

In contrast with previously proposed methods, TracIn is simple to implement; all it needs is the ability to work with gradients, checkpoints, and loss functions. The method is general.

We propose a loss function that permits abstention during training thereby allowing the DNN to abstain on confusing samples while continuing to learn and improve classification performance on the non-abstained samples. We show how such a deep abstaining classifier (DAC) can be used for robust learning in the presence of different types of label noise. In the case of structured or systematic label noise -- where noisy training labels or confusing examples are correlated with underlying features of the data-- training with abstention enables representation learning for features that are associated with unreliable labels. In the case of unstructured (arbitrary) label noise, abstention during training enables the DAC to be used as an effective data cleaner by identifying samples that are likely to have label noise. We provide analytical results on the loss function behavior that enable dynamic adaption of abstention rates based on learning progress during training. We demonstrate the utility of the deep abstaining classifier for various image classification tasks under different types of label noise; in the case of arbitrary label noise, we show significant improvements over previously published results on multiple image benchmarks.

@article{Bauer,
   abstract = {T he human impact on greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and the effects on the climate system have been documented and explained by a vast resource of scientific publications, and the conclusion-that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions need to be drastically reduced within a few decades to avoid a climate catastrophe-is accepted by more than 97% of the Earth-system science community today 1. The pressure to provide skillful predictions of extremes in a changing climate, for example, the number and intensity of tropical cyclones and the likelihood of heatwaves and drought co-occurrence, is particularly high because the present-day impact of natural hazards at a global level is staggering. In the period 1998-2017, over 1 million fatalities and several trillion dollars in economic loss have occurred 2. The years between 2010 and 2019 have been the costliest decade on record with the economic damage reaching US$2.98 trillion-US$1.19 trillion higher than 2000-2009 3. Both extreme weather and the potential failure to act on climate change rank as the leading risks combining maximum likelihood and impact for our future 4. These losses do not invalidate the steady progress achieved in weather prediction over the past decades, that is, the combined result of improved observing systems, a better understanding of the relevant physical processes occurring and interacting in the Earth system and the exponential growth of general-purpose computing technology performance at nearly constant cost 5. However, continuing at this pace is being questioned right now for two major reasons. First, the apparent effects of climate change on our environment-in particular on the frequency of occurrence and the intensity of environmental extremes-require urgent political response and much faster progress in delivering skillful predictions of future change 6,7. Earth-system models need more than steady progress and make a leap to very high resolution, a more realistic representation of processes at all scales and their interaction between atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, land surfaces and the biosphere. This leap will inevitably translate into a leap in our computational and data handling capacity needs. Second, the explosion of data challenges 8 and the demise of the 'laws' of Dennard and Moore 9 require a rethinking of the way we approach Earth-system modeling and high-performance computing (HPC) at extreme scales. These laws have been driving the development of microchips for decades. Dennard scaling states that shrinking feature sizes of transistors also decreases their power consumption such that the frequency could be increased from processor generation to the next while the heat dissipation per chip area remained approximately constant. Dennard scaling ended nearly 15 years ago and led to the 'multicore crisis' and the advent of commodity parallel processing. Moore's law drove the economics of computing by stating that every 18 months, the number of transistors on a chip would double at approximately equal cost. However, the cost per transistor starts to grow with the latest chip generations , indicating an end of this law. Therefore, in order to increase the performance while keeping the cost constant, transistors need to be used more efficiently. In this Perspective, we will present potential solutions to adapt our current algorithmic framework to best exploit what new digital technologies have to offer, thus paving the way to address the afore-mentioned challenges. In addition, we will propose the concept of a generic, scalable and performant prediction system architecture that allows advancement of our weather and climate prediction capabilities to the required levels. Powerful machine learning tools can accelerate progress in nearly all parts of this concept. The perfect application for extreme computing Weather prediction has been a pioneering application of numerical computer simulations since John von Neuman's 'Meteorology Project' in the late 1940s 10,11. Much has been achieved since then and today's operational global predictions are completed within an hour for models with about 10 million grid points, 100 vertical layers and 10 prognostic variables, initialized using 100 million observations per day. These calculations run on hundreds of nodes of general-purpose central processing units (CPU) offered by vendors in the US, Asia and Europe. The need to run simulation ensembles for predicting both state and uncertainty 12 multiplies both compute and data burden-but has proven hugely beneficial for decision-making 13. Figure 1 illustrates the elements of an operational weather prediction workflow, in which steps 2-4 are very compute-(peta-flops) and data-(100 terabytes per day) intensive. Weather simulations are different from climate simulations as they are run in burst mode at given times per day while climate predictions are run in steady-production mode to complete multi-decadal, centennial and millennial projections of the climate. Given the computational constraints, weather and climate models have diverged in the past decades: climate models need to represent closed and stable energy, water and constituent cycles at the expense of small-scale process detail; weather models, on the other hand, need this level of detail for locally accurate forecasts, but choose to exclude those Earth-system processes that are less relevant for weather on day-to-season time scales. For example, the accurate description of water-cycle processes is highly relevant for Computational science is crucial for delivering reliable weather and climate predictions. However, despite decades of high-performance computing experience, there is serious concern about the sustainability of this application in the post-Moore/ Dennard era. Here, we discuss the present limitations in the field and propose the design of a novel infrastructure that is scal-able and more adaptable to future, yet unknown computing architectures.},

Recent studies have claimed that this so-termed Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is instead a manifestation of competing time-varying effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. That conclusion is bolstered by the absence of robust multidecadal climate oscillations in control simulations of current-generation models. Paleoclimate data, however, do demonstrate multidecadal oscillatory behavior during the preindustrial era. By comparing control and forced "Last Millennium" simulations, we show that these apparent multidecadal oscillations are an artifact of pulses of volcanic activity during the preindustrial era that project markedly onto the multidecadal (50-to 70-year) frequency band. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence for internal multidecadal oscillations in the climate system.},

To understand and improve hurricane risk communication, this article examines how National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters at the National Hurricane Center and local weather forecast offices, local emergency managers, and local television and radio media create and convey hurricane risk information. Data from in-depth interviews and observational sessions with members of these groups from Greater Miami were analyzed to examine their roles, goals, and interactions, and to identify strengths and challenges in how they communicate with each other and with the public. Together, these groups succeed in partnering with each other to make information about approaching hurricane threats widely available. Yet NWS forecasters sometimes find that the information they provide is not used as they intended; media personnel want streamlined information from NWS and emergency managers that emphasizes the timing of hazards and the recommended response and protective actions; and emergency managers need forecast uncertainty information that can help them plan for different scenarios. Thus, we recommend that warning system partners 1) build understanding of each other's needs and constraints; 2) ensure formalized, yet flexible mechanisms exist for exchanging critical information; 3) improve hurricane risk communication by integrating social science knowledge to design and test messages with intended audiences; and 4) evaluate, test, and improve the NWS hurricane-related product suite in collaboration with social scientists. ©2012 American Meteorological Society.},

To answer the research question, this study conducted online surveys in which respondents from two coastal universities were asked risk perception questions based on a series of forecast graphics. Other variables measured included dispositional optimism, general hurricane risk perception, and hurricane information use. Optimistic bias was calculated from two of the risk perception questions. Results did not indicate strong support for an influence of optimistic bias or changing forecast track on risk perception. There was limited evidence that a veering track scenario may lead to differences in risk judgments about another location, but most measures of personal risk estimation were not influenced by the track. Dispositional optimism was not related to optimistic bias or many of the risk perception variables tested, including general hurricane risk perception. There did appear to be an interaction between track scenario and optimistic bias with more relationships being significant among those who received the consistent track scenario.},

As in previous research, risk perception and the perceived vulnerability of one’s home were motivating factors for hurricane evacuation. Local television news was the most important source for hurricane information. Trust in local news and viewing a weathercast in the last twenty-four hours were related to risk perception. This study was the first to examine the one-sided parasocial relationship (PSR) that develops between a viewer and a local television news or weathercaster and the viewer’s response to a hurricane. Although PSR was not related to hurricane risk perception or protective actions as anticipated, this article explores reasons that may have led to this surprising result including changes in the media landscape, or the potential for the weathercaster to play different roles in different extreme weather events. The findings contribute to our understanding of information use during a hurricane. It also raises questions about the future of media influence on decision-making.},

   abstract = {Pronounced changes in the Arctic environment add a new potential driver of anomalous weather patterns in midlatitudes that affect billions of people. Recent studies of these Arctic/midlatitude weather linkages, however, state inconsistent conclusions. A source of uncertainty arises from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Thermodynamic forcing by a rapidly warming Arctic contributes to weather events through changing surface heat fluxes and large-scale temperature and pressure gradients. But internal shifts in atmospheric dynamics — the variability of the location, strength, and character of the jet stream, blocking, and stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) — obscure the direct causes and effects. It is important to understand these associated processes to differentiate Arctic-forced variability from natural variability. For example in early winter, reduced Barents/Kara Seas sea-ice coverage may reinforce existing atmospheric teleconnections between the North Atlantic/Arctic and central Asia, and affect downstream weather in East Asia. Reduced sea ice in the Chukchi Sea can amplify atmospheric ridging of high pressure near Alaska, influencing downstream weather across North America. In late winter southward displacement of the SPV, coupled to the troposphere, leads to weather extremes in Eurasia and North America. Combined tropical and sea ice conditions can modulate the variability of the SPV. Observational evidence for Arctic/midlatitude weather linkages continues to accumulate, along with understanding of connections with pre-existing climate states. Relative to natural atmospheric variability, sea-ice loss alone has played a secondary role in Arctic/midlatitude weather linkages; the full influence of Arctic amplification remains uncertain.},

Using a large ensemble of simulations from a single climate model, we find that tropical TMT trends (1979–2018) vary widely and that a subset of realizations are within the range of satellite observations. Realizations with relatively small tropical TMT trends are accompanied by subdued sea-surface warming in the tropical central and eastern Pacific. Observed changes in sea-surface temperature have a similar pattern, implying that the observed tropical TMT trend has been reduced by multidecadal variability. We also assess the latest generation of GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). CMIP6 simulations with muted warming over the central and eastern Pacific also show reduced tropical tropospheric warming. We find that 13% of the model realizations have tropical TMT trends within the observed trend range. These simulations are from models with both small and large climate sensitivity values, illustrating that the magnitude of tropical tropospheric warming is not solely a function of climate sensitivity. For global averages, one-quarter of model simulations exhibit TMT trends in accord with observations. Our results indicate that even on 40-y timescales, natural climate variability is important to consider when comparing observed and simulated tropospheric warming and is sufficiently large to explain TMT trend differences between models and satellite data.</p>},

We then demonstrate this in practice by applying large neural networks, with hundreds of parameters per training observation, to a collection of 116 real-world data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This collection of data sets contains a much smaller number of training examples than the types of image classification tasks generally studied in the deep learning literature, as well as non-trivial label noise.

   abstract = {Time of emergence of anthropogenic climate change is a crucial metric in risk assessments surrounding future climate predictions. However, internal climate variability impairs the ability to make accurate statements about when climate change emerges from a background reference state. None of the existing efforts to explore uncertainties in time of emergence has explicitly explored the role of internal atmospheric circulation variability. Here a dynamical adjustment method based on constructed circulation analogs is used to provide new estimates of time of emergence of anthropogenic warming over North America and Europe from both a local and spatially aggregated perspective. After removing the effects of internal atmospheric circulation variability, the emergence of anthropogenic warming occurs on average two decades earlier in winter and one decade earlier in summer over North America and Europe. Dynamical adjustment increases the percentage of land area over which warming has emerged by about 30% and 15% in winter (10% and5%in summer) over North America and Europe, respectively. Using a large ensemble of simulations with a climate model, evidence is provided that thermodynamic factors related to variations in snow cover, sea ice, and soil moisture are important drivers of the remaining uncertainty in time of emergence. Model biases in variability lead to an underestimation (13%-22% over North America and <5% over Europe) of the land fraction emerged by 2010 in summer, indicating that the forced warming signal emerges earlier in observations than suggested by models. The results herein illustrate opportunities for future detection and attribution studies to improve physical understanding by explicitly accounting for internal atmospheric circulation variability.},

   abstract = {The global average temperature of the Earth has increased, but year-to-year variability in local climates impedes the identification of clear changes in observations and human experience. For a signal to become obvious in data records or in a human lifetime it needs to be greater than the noise of variability and thereby lead to a significant shift in the distribution of temperature. We show that locations with the largest amount of warming may not display a clear shift in temperature distributions if the local variability is also large. Based on observational data only we demonstrate that large parts of the Earth have experienced a significant local shift towards warmer temperatures in the summer season, particularly at lower latitudes. We also show that these regions are similar to those that are found to be significant in standard detection methods, thus providing an approach to link locally significant changes more closely to impacts. © 2012.

   abstract = {Projections of future climate change are increasingly based on the output of many different models. Typically, the mean over all model simulations is considered as the optimal prediction, with the underlying assumption that different models provide statistically independent information evenly distributed around the true state. However, there is reason to believe that this is not the best assumption. Coupled models are of comparable complexity and are constructed in similar ways. Some models share parts of the same code and some models are even developed at the same center. Therefore, the limitations of these models tend to be fairly similar, contributing to the well-known problem of common model biases and possibly to an unrealistically small spread in the outcomes of model predictions. This study attempts to quantify the extent of this problem by asking how many models there effectively are and howto best determine this number.Quantifying the effective number ofmodels is achieved by evaluating 24 state-of-the-art models and their ability to simulate broad aspects of twentieth-century climate. Using two different approaches, the amount of unique information in the ensemble is calculated and the effective ensemble size is found to be much smaller than the actual number of models. As more models are included in an ensemble, the amount of new information diminishes in proportion. Furthermore, this reduction is found to go beyond the problem of "same center" models and systemic similarities are seen to exist across all models. The results suggest that current methodologies for the interpretation of multimodel ensembles may lead to overly confident climate predictions. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

The consequence is a set of IPCC imagery where our understanding of perception remains empirically unchallenged. The visual design (defined in this study as the method, technique, and style used to create a visual) directly affects perception and yet, we know very little about how people intuitively respond to visuals depicting climate science. This study examines the perception of four images from the IPCC summary report for policymakers and two open sourced infographics. Using a group-administered study we found the visual design to have a significant impact on a novice readers ability to associate relevant words with an image. While the visuals part of the summary for policymakers educed a sense of confidence, a well-designed infographic left readers feeling less confident. The veneer of legitimacy associated with IPCC visuals is because they look scientific, whereas infographic images were found to look less serious. We acknowledge the accessibility of an infographic but urge IPCC authors to use it with caution, as any negative impact on scientific credibility is an unwanted feature in IPCC communication.},

   abstract = {<p>Abstract. Single model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs) are valuable tools that can be used to investigate the climate system. SMILEs allow scientists to quantify and separate the internal variability of the climate system and its response to external forcing, with different types of SMILEs appropriate to answer different scientific questions. In this editorial we first provide an introduction to SMILEs and an overview of the studies in the special issue “Large Ensemble Climate Model Simulations: Exploring Natural Variability, Change Signals and Impacts”. These studies analyse a range of different types of SMILEs including global climate models (GCMs), regionally downscaled climate models (RCMs), a hydrological model with input from a RCM SMILE, a SMILE with prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) built for event attribution, a SMILE that assimilates observed data, and an initialised regional model. These studies provide novel methods, that can be used with SMILEs. The methods published in this issue include a snapshot empirical orthogonal function analysis used to investigate El Niño–Southern Oscillation teleconnections; the partitioning of future uncertainty into model differences, internal variability, and scenario choices; a weighting scheme for multi-model ensembles that can incorporate SMILEs; and a method to identify the required ensemble size for any given problem. Studies in this special issue also focus on RCM SMILEs, with projections of the North Atlantic Oscillation and its regional impacts assessed over Europe, and an RCM SMILE intercomparison. Finally a subset of studies investigate projected impacts of global warming, with increased water flows projected for future hydrometeorological events in southern Ontario; precipitation projections over central Europe are investigated and found to be inconsistent across models in the Alps, with a continuation of past tendencies in Mid-Europe; and equatorial Asia is found to have an increase in the probability of large fire and drought events under higher levels of warming. These studies demonstrate the utility of different types of SMILEs. In the second part of this editorial we provide a perspective on how three types of SMILEs could be combined to exploit the advantages of each. To do so we use a GCM SMILE and an RCM SMILE with all forcings, as well as a naturally forced GCM SMILE (nat-GCM) over the European domain. We utilise one of the key advantages of SMILEs, precisely separating the forced response and internal variability within an individual model to investigate a variety of simple questions. Broadly we show that the GCM can be used to investigate broad-scale patterns and can be directly compared to the nat-GCM to attribute forced changes to either anthropogenic emissions or volcanoes. The RCM provides high-resolution spatial information of both the forced change and the internal variability around this change at different warming levels. By combining all three ensembles we can gain information that would not be available using a single type of SMILE alone, providing a perspective on future research that could be undertaken using these tools.</p>},

   abstract = {The expressiveness principle for visualization design asserts that a visualization should encode all of the available data, and only the available data, implying that continuous data types should be visualized with a continuous encoding channel. And yet, in many domains binning continuous data is not only pervasive, but it is accepted as standard practice. Prior work provides no clear guidance for when encoding continuous data continuously is preferable to employing binning techniques or how this choice affects data interpretation and decision making. In this paper, we present a study aimed at better understanding the conditions in which the expressiveness principle can or should be violated for visualizing continuous data. We provided participants with visualizations employing either continuous or binned greyscale encodings of geospatial elevation data and compared participants' ability to complete a wide variety of tasks. For various tasks, the results indicate significant differences in decision making, confidence in responses, and task completion time between continuous and binned encodings of the data. In general, participants with continuous encodings were faster to complete many of the tasks, but never outperformed those with binned encodings, while performance accuracy with binned encodings was superior to continuous encodings in some tasks. These findings suggest that strict adherence to the expressiveness principle is not always advisable. We discuss both the implications and limitations of our results and outline various avenues for potential work needed to further improve guidelines for using continuous versus binned encodings for continuous data types.},

We present a multi-model, multi-method analysis on how anthropogenic climate change affected the probability of these events occurring using both observational datasets and a large collection of climate models, including state-of-the-art higher-resolution simulations designed for attribution and many from the latest generation of coupled ocean-atmosphere models, CMIP6.

We show that human-induced climate change has dramatically increased the probability of occurrence and magnitude of extremes in both of these (with lower confidence for the probability for Verkhoyansk) and that without human influence the temperatures widely experienced in Siberia in the first half of 2020 would have been practically impossible.</p>},

   abstract = {(2019) demonstrate a technique for forecast of opportunity identification through the utilization of expected skill from a linear inverse model. The study demonstrates the ability of the linear statistical model to identify forecasts of opportunity, and raises the question of whether other statistical models, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), can identify forecasts of opportunity for subseasonal prediction. ANNs are very good at nonlinear function estimation (Chen & Chen, 1995), and thus, may be able to identify both linear and nonlinear relationships that lend predictability. Recently, neural networks have been successfully applied to seasonal prediction of meteorological variables such as monthly rainfall (Abbot & Marohasy, 2014) and surface temperature (Toms et al., 2020) as well as yearly prediction of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (Ham et al., 2019), suggesting neural networks may be useful for identifying subseasonal forecasts of opportunity as well. In this paper, we test whether an ANN can be used for subseasonal forecast of opportunity identification. To do so, we input tropical outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies into an ANN and task the network to predict the sign of 500 hPa geopotential height (z500) anomalies in the North Atlantic (40°N, 325°E) 22 days later (e.g., Week 4). Tropical OLR is used to explore the ability of an ANN to identify known relationships between the MJO and the North Atlantic via tropical-extratropical teleconnections (e.g., Cassou, 2008; Hen-derson et al., 2016). We demonstrate that an ANN can identify subseasonal forecasts of opportunity related to tropical OLR, and through an ANN explainability technique, demonstrate that the ANN identifies these known MJO-like OLR patterns. In addition, we find a possible new tropical OLR pattern associated with predictable behavior of the North Atlantic circulation on subseasonal timescales.},

   abstract = {<p>The last few years have seen an explosion of interest in extreme event attribution, the science of estimating the influence of human activities or other factors on the probability and other characteristics of an observed extreme weather or climate event. This is driven by public interest, but also has practical applications in decision-making after the event and for raising awareness of current and future climate change impacts. The World Weather Attribution (WWA) collaboration has over the last 5 years developed a methodology to answer these questions in a scientifically rigorous way in the immediate wake of the event when the information is most in demand. This methodology has been developed in the practice of investigating the role of climate change in two dozen extreme events world-wide. In this paper, we highlight the lessons learned through this experience. The methodology itself is documented in a more extensive companion paper. It covers all steps in the attribution process: the event choice and definition, collecting and assessing observations and estimating probability and trends from these, climate model evaluation, estimating modelled hazard trends and their significance, synthesis of the attribution of the hazard, assessment of trends in vulnerability and exposure, and communication. Here, we discuss how each of these steps entails choices that may affect the results, the common problems that can occur and how robust conclusions can (or cannot) be derived from the analysis. Some of these developments also apply to other attribution methodologies and indeed to other problems in climate science.</p>},

Aiming at the imperious demand of short-term prediction for sea ice, we develop a new data-driven prediction technique for the sea ice concentration (SIC) combined with causal analysis. Through the causal analysis based on kernel Granger causality (KGC) test, key environmental factors affecting SIC are selected. Then multiple popular machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely self-adaptive differential extreme learning machine (SaD-ELM), classification and regression tree (CART), random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR), are employed to predict daily SIC, respectively. The experimental results in the Barents-Kara (B-K) sea show: (1) compared with correlation analysis, the input variables of ML models screened out by causal analysis achieve better prediction; (2) when lead time is short (<3 d), the four ML algorithms are all suitable for short-term prediction of daily SIC, while RF and SaD-ELM have better prediction performance with long lead time (>3 d); (3) RF has the best prediction accuracy and generalization ability but hugely time consuming, while SaD-ELM achieves more favorable performance when taking computational complexity into consideration. In summary, ML is applicable to short-term prediction of daily SIC, which develops a new way of sea ice prediction and provides technical support for Arctic navigation.},

Here proxy SSTs from different approaches are evaluated and an improved proxy SST method is shown. The improved proxy SSTs were tested in an SST analysis, and showed reduced bias and random errors compared to the Arctic buoy SSTs. Almost all reduction in errors is in the warm melt season. In the cold season the SIC is typically high and all estimates tend to have low errors. The improved method will be incorporated into an operational SST analysis.},

This evaluation framework allows us to directly attribute discrepancies between models and observations to biases in the simulated internal variability or forced response, without relying on assumptions to separate these signals in observations. The largest discrepancies result from the overestimated forced warming in some models during recent decades. In contrast, models do not systematically over-or underestimate internal variability in global mean temperature. On regional scales, all models misrepresent surface temperature variability over the Southern Ocean, while overestimating variability over land-surface areas, such as the Amazon and South Asia, and high-latitude oceans. Our evaluation shows that MPI-GE, followed by GFDL-ESM2M and CESM-LE offer the best global and regional representation of both the internal variability and forced response in observed historical temperatures.},

   abstract = {It remains difficult to disentangle the relative influences of aerosols and greenhouse gases on regional surface temperature trends in the context of global climate change. To address this issue, we use a new collection of initial-condition large ensembles from the Community Earth System Model version 1 that are prescribed with different combinations of industrial aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing. To compare the climate response to these external forcings, we adopt an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture from previous work that predicts the year by training on maps of near-surface temperature. We then utilize layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize the regional temperature signals that are important for the ANN's prediction in each climate model experiment. To mask noise when extracting only the most robust climate patterns from LRP, we introduce a simple uncertainty metric that can be adopted to other explainable artificial intelligence (AI) problems. We find that the North Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and Southeast Asia are key regions of importance for the neural network to make its prediction, especially prior to the early-21st century. Notably, we also find that the ANN predictions based on maps of observations correlate higher to the actual year after training on the large ensemble experiment with industrial aerosols held fixed to 1920 levels. This work illustrates the sensitivity of regional temperature signals to changes in aerosol forcing in historical simulations. By using explainable AI methods, we have the opportunity to improve our understanding of (non)linear combinations of anthropogenic forcings in state-of-the-art global climate models.},

   abstract = {<p>Previous modelling and observational studies have shown discrepancies in the interannual relationship of winter surface air temperature (SAT) between Arctic and East Asia, stimulating the debate about whether Arctic change can influence midlatitude climate. This study uses two sets of coordinated experiments (EXP1 and EXP2) from six different atmospheric general circulation models. Both EXP1 and EXP2 consist of 130 ensemble members, each of which in EXP1 (EXP2) was forced by the same observed daily varying sea ice and daily varying (daily climatological) sea surface temperature (SST) for 1982–2014 but with different atmospheric initial conditions. Large spread exists among ensemble members in simulating the Arctic–East Asian SAT relationship. Only a fraction of ensemble members can reproduce the observed deep Arctic warming–cold continent pattern which extends from surface to upper troposphere, implying the important role of atmospheric internal variability. The mechanisms of deep Arctic warming and shallow Arctic warming are further distinguished. Arctic warming aloft is caused primarily by poleward moisture transport, which in conjunction with the surface warming coupled with sea ice melting constitutes the surface-amplified deep Arctic warming throughout the troposphere. These processes associated with the deep Arctic warming may be related to the forcing of remote SST when there is favorable atmospheric circulation such as Rossby wave train propagating from the North Atlantic into the Arctic.</p>},

In general, all SST products show consistent spatial patterns and temporal variability during the overlapping time period (2003-18). The main differences between each product are located in the western boundary current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current regions. Linear trends display consistent SST spatial patterns among all products and exhibit a strong warming trend from 2012 to 2018 with the Pacific Ocean basin as the main contributor. The SST discrepancy between all SST products is very small compared to the significant warming trend. Spatial power spectral density shows that the interpolation into 18 spatial resolution has negligible impacts on our results. The global mean SST time series reveals larger differences among all SST products during the early period of the satellite era (1982-2002) when there were fewer observations, indicating that the observation frequency is the main constraint of the SST climatology.

   abstract = {The intensification of extreme precipitation under anthropogenic forcing is robustly projected by global climate models, but highly challenging to detect in the observational record. Large internal variability distorts this anthropogenic signal. Models produce diverse magnitudes of precipitation response to anthropogenic forcing, largely due to differing schemes for parameterizing subgrid-scale processes. Meanwhile, multiple global observational datasets of daily precipitation exist, developed using varying techniques and inhomogeneously sampled data in space and time. Previous attempts to detect human influence on extreme precipitation have not incorporated model uncertainty, and have been limited to specific regions and observational datasets. Using machine learning methods that can account for these uncertainties and capable of identifying the time evolution of the spatial patterns, we find a physically interpretable anthropogenic signal that is detectable in all global observational datasets. Machine learning efficiently generates multiple lines of evidence supporting detection of an anthropogenic signal in global extreme precipitation. Climate models project an intensification of extreme precipitation under climate change, but this effect is difficult to detect in the observational record. Here, the authors show that a physically interpretable anthropogenic impact on extreme precipitation is detectable in global observational data sets.},

   abstract = {Severe cold air outbreaks have significant impacts on human health, energy use, agriculture, and transportation. Anomalous behavior of the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex provides an important source of subseasonal-to-seasonal predictability of Northern Hemisphere cold air outbreaks. Here, through reanalysis data for the period 1958–2019 and climate model simulations for preindustrial conditions, we show that weak stratospheric polar vortex conditions increase the risk of severe cold air outbreaks in mid-latitude East Asia by 100%, in contrast to only 40% for moderate cold air outbreaks. Such a disproportionate increase is also found in Europe, with an elevated risk persisting more than three weeks. By analysing the stream of polar cold air mass, we show that the polar vortex affects severe cold air outbreaks by modifying the inter-hemispheric transport of cold air mass. Using a novel method to assess Granger causality, we show that the polar vortex provides predictive information regarding severe cold air outbreaks over multiple regions in the Northern Hemisphere, which may help with mitigating their impact. A weak stratospheric polar vortex in the Arctic leads to a disproportionally increased risk of severe cold air outbreaks over northern extratropical regions, compared to moderate outbreaks, suggest analyses of reanalysis data and climate model simulations.},

   abstract = {Attribution studies on recent global warming by Global Climate Model (GCM) ensembles converge in showing the fundamental role of anthropogenic forcings as primary drivers of temperature in the last half century. However, despite their differences, all these models pertain to the same dynamical approach and come from a common ancestor, so that their very similar results in attribution studies are not surprising and cannot be considered as a clear proof of robustness of the results themselves. Thus, here we adopt a completely different, non-dynamical, data-driven and fully nonlinear approach to the attribution problem. By means of neural network (NN) modelling, and analysing the last 160 years, we perform attribution experiments and find that the strong increase in global temperature of the last half century may be attributed basically to anthropogenic forcings (with details on their specific contributions), while the Sun considerably influences the period 1910–1975. Furthermore, the role of sulphate aerosols and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation for better catching interannual to decadal temperature variability is clarified. Sensitivity analyses to forcing changes are also performed. The NN outcomes both corroborate our previous knowledge from GCMs and give new insight into the relative contributions of external forcings and internal variability to climate.},

   abstract = {Most historical sea surface temperature (SST) estimates indicate warmer World War II SSTs than expected from forcing and internal climate variability. If real, this World War II warm anomaly (WW2WA) has important implications for decadal variability, but the WW2WA may also arise from incomplete corrections of biases associated with bucket and engine room intake (ERI) measurements. To better assess the origins of the WW2WA, we develop five different historical SST estimates (reconstructions R1–R5). Using uncorrected SST measurements from the International Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) version 3.0 (R1) gives a WW2WA of 0.418C. In contrast, using only buckets (R2) or ERI observations (R3) gives WW2WAs of 0.188 and 0.088C, respectively, implying that uncorrected biases are the primary source of the WW2WA. We then use an extended linear-mixed-effect method to quantify systematic differences between subsets of SSTs and develop groupwise SST adjustments based on differences between pairs of nearby SST measurements. Using all measurements after applying groupwise adjustments (R4) gives a WW2WA of 0.138C [95% confidence interval (c.i.): 0.018–0.268C] and indicates that U.S. and U.K. naval observations are the primary cause of the WW2WA. Finally, nighttime bucket SSTs are found to be warmer than their daytime counterparts during WW2, prompting a daytime-only reconstruction using groupwise adjustments (R5) that has a WW2WA of 0.098C (95% c.i.: 20.018 to 0.188C). R5 is consistent with the range of internal variability found in either the CMIP5 (95% c.i.: 20.108 to 0.108C) or CMIP6 ensembles (95% c.i.: 20.118 to 0.108C). These results support the hypothesis that the WW2WA is an artifact of observational biases, although further data and metadata analyses will be important for confirmation.},

The motivation for defining the PDO index on HC300 stems from the following considerations: (i) a need to accentuate lower-frequency variations in the monitoring of PDO and (ii) to take into account variations in the temperatures associated with the PDO that extend throughout the upper ocean (and are modulated by the seasonal cycle of mixed layer variability). It is demonstrated that an HC300-based definition is better suited to encapsulate these characteristics in the PDO variability. The variability in an HC300-based definition is also contrasted with the traditional definition of the PDO based on SSTs.},

   abstract = {Neural networks are increasingly used in environmental science applications. Furthermore, neural network models are trained by minimizing a loss function, and it is crucial to choose the loss function very carefully for environmental science applications, as it determines what exactly is being optimized. Standard loss functions do not cover all the needs of the environmental sciences, which makes it important for scientists to be able to develop their own custom loss functions so that they can implement many of the classic performance measures already developed in environmental science, including measures developed for spatial model verification. However, there are very few resources available that cover the basics of custom loss function development comprehensively, and to the best of our knowledge none that focus on the needs of environmental scientists. This document seeks to fill this gap by providing a guide on how to write custom loss functions targeted toward environmental science applications. Topics include the basics of writing custom loss functions, common pitfalls, functions to use in loss functions, examples such as fractions skill score as loss function, how to incorporate physical constraints, discrete and soft discretization, and concepts such as focal, robust, and adaptive loss. While examples are currently provided in this guide for Python with Keras and the TensorFlow backend, the basic concepts also apply to other environments, such as Python with PyTorch. Similarly, while the sample loss functions provided here are from meteorology, these are just examples of how to create custom loss functions. Other fields in the environmental sciences have very similar needs for custom loss functions, e.g., for evaluating spatial forecasts effectively, and the concepts discussed here can be applied there as well.

The annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) anomaly for land areas poleward of 60°N was 2.1°C above the 1981–2010 average, marking the highest observed SAT anomaly for the terrestrial Arctic since at least 1900. It was also the seventh consecutive year with SAT anomalies of more than +1°C higher than the 1981–2010 average. This continued increase in Arctic SAT is the primary driver for many of the changes observed on a pan-Arctic scale and enhanced regionally in any given year. During 2020, for example, warm SAT anomalies persisted from winter into summer across the Eurasian Arctic, contributing to early and widespread wildfire activity across the region and to the near-record sea ice retreat and warm summer and autumn sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Laptev and Kara Seas.},

This has far-reaching consequences for indigenous and local communities, polar ecosystems, and global climate, motivating the need for accurate seasonal sea ice forecasts. While physics-based dynamical models can successfully forecast sea ice concentration several weeks ahead, they struggle to outperform simple statistical benchmarks at longer lead times. We present a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system, IceNet. The system has been trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps. We show that IceNet advances the range of accurate sea ice forecasts, outperforming a state-of-the-art dynamical model in seasonal forecasts of summer sea ice, particularly for extreme sea ice events. This step-change in sea ice forecasting ability brings us closer to conservation tools that mitigate risks associated with rapid sea ice loss. Accurate seasonal forecasts of sea ice are highly valuable, particularly in the context of sea ice loss due to global warming. A new machine learning tool for sea ice forecasting offers a substantial increase in accuracy over current physics-based dynamical model predictions.},

   abstract = {As a step towards understanding the fundamental drivers of polar climate change, we evaluate contributions to polar warming and its seasonal and hemispheric asymmetries in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) as compared with CMIP5. CMIP6 models broadly capture the observed pattern of surface- and winter-dominated Arctic warming that has outpaced both tropical and Antarctic warming in recent decades. For both CMIP5 and CMIP6, CO2 quadrupling experiments reveal that the lapse-rate and albedo feedbacks contribute most to stronger warming in the Arctic than the tropics or Antarctic. The relative strength of the polar albedo feedback in comparison to the lapse-rate feedback is sensitive to the choice of radiative kernel, and the albedo feedback contributes most to intermodel spread in polar warming at both poles. By separately calculating moist and dry atmospheric heat transport, we show that increased poleward moisture transport is another important driver of Arctic amplification and the largest contributor to projected Antarctic warming. Seasonal ocean heat storage and winter-amplified temperature feedbacks contribute most to the winter peak in warming in the Arctic and a weaker winter peak in the Antarctic. In comparison with CMIP5, stronger polar warming in CMIP6 results from a larger albedo feedback at both poles, combined with less-negative cloud feedbacks in the Arctic and increased poleward moisture transport in the Antarctic. However, normalizing by the global-mean surface warming yields a similar degree of Arctic amplification and only slightly increased Antarctic amplification in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5.},

   abstract = {<p><![CDATA[Abstract. Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management. The full ERA5-Land hourly (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019a) and monthly (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019b) averaged datasets presented in this paper are available through the C3S Climate Data Store at https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac and https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.68d2bb30, respectively.]]></p>},

   abstract = {<p><![CDATA[Abstract. In recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70∘ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2.5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65∘ N are larger than emissions from the anthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60∘ N, with 56 % of black carbon emissions above 65∘ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.]]></p>},

However, a number of individual ensemble members from that set of models successfully simulate the early-2000s hiatus when naturally-occurring climate variability involving the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) coincided, by chance, with the observed negative phase of the IPO that contributed to the early-2000s hiatus. If the recent methodology of initialized decadal climate prediction could have been applied in the mid-1990s using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 multi-models, both the negative phase of the IPO in the early 2000s as well as the hiatus could have been simulated, with the multi-model average performing better than most of the individual models.

   abstract = {Despite a steady increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), global-mean surface temperature (T) has shown no discernible warming since about 2000, in sharp contrast to model simulations, which on average project strong warming 1-3. The recent slowdown in observed surface warming has been attributed to decadal cooling in the tropical Pacific 1,4,5 , intensifying trade winds 5 , changes in El Niño activity 6,7 , increasing volcanic activity 8-10 and decreasing solar irradiance 7. Earlier periods of arrested warming have been observed but received much less attention than the recent period, and their causes are poorly understood. Here we analyse observed and model-simulated global T fields to quantify the contributions of internal climate variability (ICV) to decadal changes in global-mean T since 1920. We show that the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) has been associated with large T anomalies over both ocean and land. Combined with another leading mode of ICV, the IPO explains most of the diierence between observed and model-simulated rates of decadal change in global-mean T since 1920, and particularly over the so-called 'hiatus' period since about 2000. We conclude that ICV, mainly through the IPO, was largely responsible for the recent slowdown, as well as for earlier slowdowns and accelerations in global-mean T since 1920, with preferred spatial patterns diierent from those associated with GHG-induced warming or aerosol-induced cooling. Recent history suggests that the IPO could reverse course and lead to accelerated global warming in the coming decades. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO; refs 11,12), or more generally the IPO (refs 13,14), switched from a warm phase to a cold phase around 1999 15. This switch has been associated with a cooling trend since the early 1990s over the Equatorial Central and Eastern Pacific (ECEP; 15 • S-15 • N, 180 •-80 • W) that has contributed to the recent hiatus in global-mean T (refs 4,5). Modelling studies 1,16,17 have also shown that the IPO can modulate the rate of global warming through changes in ocean heat uptake. Given the well-documented extra-tropical response to tropical forcings 18,19 , it is not surprising that IPO-associated sea surface temperature (SST) variations in the ECEP have had a large impact on global-mean T (ref. 1). The recent cooling of the ECEP has been accompanied by strengthening trade winds 5 and increasing ocean heat uptake 4,16,17,20 , typical of a La Niña event 21 but over decadal timescales. Although these studies all point to a major contribution of the ECEP to the recent global warming slowdown, it is unclear how much of the observed SST change in the ECEP is associated with ICV, particularly the IPO, and how much is due to external forcing change, such as stratospheric aerosols 7-10.

Assuming bias in TAS has stabilized in the 10 year predictions, after bias adjustment, TAS anomalies for the 2016-2035 period in the 30 year predictions initialized in 2006 are about 16% less than the uninitialized projections. One contributing factor for the improved climate simulation is the bias adjustment, which corrects the models' systematic errors and higher-than-observed decadal warming trend. Another important factor is the initialization with observations which constrains the ocean such that the starting points of the initialized simulations are close to the observed initial states.

In the extratropics, large-scale atmospheric circulation is responsible for much of observed regional climate variability, from seasonal to multidecadal timescales. However, the extratropical circulation variability on multidecadal timescales is systematically weaker in coupled climate models. Here we show that projections of future extratropical climate from coupled model simulations significantly underestimate the projected uncertainty range originating from large-scale atmospheric circulation variability. Using observational datasets and large ensembles of coupled climate models, we produce synthetic ensemble projections constrained to have variability consistent with the large-scale atmospheric circulation in observations. Compared to the raw model projections, the synthetic observationally-constrained projections exhibit an increased uncertainty in projected 21st century temperature and precipitation changes across much of the Northern extratropics. This increased uncertainty is also associated with an increase of the projected occurrence of future extreme seasons. Future projections of northern hemisphere extratropical climate based on climate model simulations substantially underestimate the uncertainty that originates from large-scale atmospheric circulation variability, suggest synthetic ensemble projections constrained with observations.},

   abstract = {Interactions between the tropical and subtropical northern Pacific at decadal time scales are examined using uncoupled oceanic and atmospheric simulations. An atmospheric model is forced with observed Pacific sea surface temperatures (SST) decadal anomalies, computed as the difference between the 2000–2009 and the 1990–1999 period. The resulting pattern has negative SST anomalies at the equator, with a global pattern reminiscent of the Pacific decadal oscillation. The tropical SST anomalies are responsible for driving a weakening of the Hadley cell and atmospheric meridional heat transport. The atmosphere is then shown to produce a significant response in the subtropics, with wind-stress-curl anomalies having the opposite sign from the climatological mean, consistent with a weakening of the oceanic subtropical gyre (STG). A global ocean model is then forced with the decadal anomalies from the atmospheric model. In the North Pacific, the shallow subtropical cell (STC) spins down and the meridional heat transport is reduced, resulting in positive tropical SST anomalies. The final tropical response is reached after the first 10 years of the experiment, consistent with the Rossby-wave adjustment time for both the STG and the STC. The STC provides the connection between subtropical wind stress anomalies and tropical SSTs. In fact, targeted simulations show the importance of off-equatorial wind stress anomalies in driving the oceanic response, whereas anomalous tropical winds have no role in the SST signal reversal. We further explore the connection between STG, STC and tropical SST with the help of an idealized model. We argue that, in our models, tropical SST decadal variability stems from the forcing of the Pacific subtropical gyre through the atmospheric response to ENSO. The resulting Ekman pumping anomaly alters the STC and oceanic heat transport, providing a negative feedback on the SST. We thus suggest that extratropical atmospheric responses to tropical forcing have feedbacks onto the ocean dynamics that lead to a time-delayed response of the tropical oceans, giving rise to a possible mechanism for multidecadal ocean-atmosphere coupled variability.},

In one perspective, we explore the physical mechanisms for sea surface temperature patterns and highlight the role of natural variability, particularly the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) that both have chaotic/random phases. In the other perspective, we investigate how the hiatus relates to changes in energy fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and to the three-dimensional distribution of ocean heat content change on decadal timescales. We find that the recent surface warming hiatus is associated with a transition of the IPO from a positive to negative phase and with heat redistribution between the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. The AMO has shifted to a positive phase since the late 1990s, inducing a La Niña-type response over the tropical Pacific via a tropic-wide teleconnection, contributing to the global warming hiatus.},

Here we show that the deep heat penetration in these two basins is not unique to the hiatus but is characteristic of anthropogenic warming and merely reflects the depth of the mean meridional overturning circulation in the basin. We find, however, that heat redistribution in the upper 350 m between the Pacific and Indian Oceans is closely tied to the surface warming hiatus. The Indian Ocean shows an anomalous warming below 50 m during hiatus events due to an enhanced heat transport by the Indonesian throughflow in response to the intensified trade winds in the equatorial Pacific. Thus, the Pacific and Indian Oceans are the key regions to track ocean heat uptake during the surface warming hiatus. Mechanisms for the warming hiatus are inferred by tracking regional ocean heat uptake in different regions. Here, the authors show that the Indo-Pacific heat redistribution holds the key while the abyssal heat uptake in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans primarily reflects the downward penetration of anthropogenic heat.},

The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of 38 CMIP5 climate models to provide further evidence that models produce warming hiatus periods during warming experiments. GST rates are simulated in each model for the 21st century using two experiments: a moderate warming scenario (RCP4.5) and high-end scenario (RCP8.5). Warming hiatus periods are identified in model simulations by detecting (1) ≥15-year periods lacking a statistically meaningful trend and (2) rapid changes in the GST rate which resemble the observed 1998–2012 hiatus. Under the RCP4.5 experiment, all tested models produce warming hiatus periods. However, once radiative forcing exceeds 5 W/m 2 —about 2°C GST increase—as simulated in the RCP8.5 experiment after 2050, nearly all models produce only positive warming trends. All models show evidence of rapid changes in the GST rate resembling the observed hiatus, showing that the climate variations associated with warming hiatus periods are still evident in the models, even under accelerated warming conditions. },

This study compares the global mean surface air temperature from 29 CMIP6 models with observations from three datasets. We examine (1) warming and cooling rates in five subperiods from 1880 to 2014, (2) autocorrelation and long-term persistence, (3) models' performance based on probabilistic and entropy metrics, and (4) the distributional shape of temperature. All models simulate the observed long-term warming trend from 1880 to 2014. The late twentieth century warming (1975–2014) and the hiatus (1942–1975) are replicated by most models. The post-1998 warming is overestimated in 90% of the simulations. Only six out of 29 models reproduce the observed long-term persistence. All models show differences in distributional shape when compared with observations. Varying performance across metrics reveals the challenge to determine the “best” model. Thus, we argue that models should be selected, based on case-specific metrics, depending on the intended use. Metrics proposed here facilitate a comprehensive assessment for various applications.},

   abstract = {Globally averaged surface air temperatures in some decades show rapid increases (accelerated warming decades), and in other decades there is no warming trend (hiatus decades). A previous study showed that the net energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere of about 1Wm22 is associated with greater increases of deep ocean heat content below 750m during the hiatus decades, while there is little globally averaged surface temperature increase or warming in the upper ocean layers. Here the authors examine processes involved with accelerated warming decades and address the relative roles of external forcing from increasing greenhouse gases and internally generated decadal climate variability associated with interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO). Model results from the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), show that accelerated warming decades are characterized by rapid warming of globally averaged surface air temperature, greater increases of heat content in the upper ocean layers, and less heat content increase in the deep ocean, opposite to the hiatus decades. In addition to contributions from processes potentially linked to Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), the positive phase of the IPO, adding to the response to external forcing, is usually associated with accelerated warming decades. Conversely, hiatus decades typically occur with the negative phase of the IPO, when warming from the external forcing is overwhelmed by internally generated cooling in the tropical Pacific. Internally generated hiatus periods of up to 15 years with zero global warming trend are present in the future climate simulations. This suggests that there is a chance that the current observed hiatus could extend for several more years. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {The negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), a dominant mode of multi-decadal variability of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Pacific, contributed to the reduced rate of global surface temperature warming in the early 2000s. A proposed mechanism for IPO multidecadal variability indicates that the presence of decadal timescale upper ocean heat content in the off-equatorial western tropical Pacific can provide conditions for an interannual El Niño/Southern Oscillation event to trigger a transition of tropical Pacific SSTs to the opposite IPO phase. Here we show that a decadal prediction initialized in 2013 simulates predicted Niño3.4 SSTs that have qualitatively tracked the observations through 2015. The year three to seven average prediction (2015–2019) from the 2013 initial state shows a transition to the positive phase of the IPO from the previous negative phase and a resumption of larger rates of global warming over the 2013–2022 period consistent with a positive IPO phase. The phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) impacts global temperatures. Here, the authors show that a build-up of off-equatorial western tropical Pacific heat content allows ENSO events to trigger IPO phase changes, with a predicted switch to a positive IPO for 2015–2019 and larger warming trends.},

   abstract = {Changes in subseasonal temperature variability are linked with the altered probability of weather extremes and have important impacts on society and ecological systems. Earlier studies based on observations up to 2014 have shown a general decrease in subseasonal temperature variability over Northern Hemisphere extratropical land. However, these changes have been confined to specific regions and seasons, have limited statistical significance and human influence is yet to be determined. Here we show using up-to-date observations and climate model simulations that a human fingerprint, or pattern of change, in subseasonal variability has recently emerged over the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. The fingerprint features decreased near-surface air temperature variability over land in the high-northern latitudes in autumn, further extending into mid-latitudes in winter. Using large ensembles of single-forcing model experiments, we attribute the pattern of reduced temperature variability primarily to increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, with anthropogenic aerosols playing a secondary role. Our results reveal that human influence is now detectable in hemispheric-wide day-to-day temperature variability and motivates research into the impacts of reduced temperature volatility on societal and ecological systems. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for the observed decrease in subseasonal temperature variability in the northern extratropics, according to an attribution analysis using a large ensemble of climate model simulations.},

   abstract = {Increasingly, the risk assessment community has recognized the social and cultural aspects of vulnerability to hurricanes and other hazards that impact planning and public communication. How individuals and communities understand and react to natural hazard risk communications can be driven by a number of different cognitive, cultural, economic, and political factors. The social sciences have seen an increased focus over the last decade on studying hurricane understanding and responses from a social, cognitive, or decision science perspective, which, broadly defined, includes a number of disparate fields. This paper is a cross-disciplinary and critical review of those efforts as they are relevant to hurricane risk communication devel-opment. We focus on two areas that, on the basis of a comprehensive literature review and discussions with experts in the field, have received comparatively little attention from the hazards community: 1) research concerning visual communications and the way in which individuals process, understand, and make decisions regarding them and 2) the way in which vulnerable communities understand and interact with hurricane warning communications. We go on to suggest areas that merit increased research and draw lessons or guidance from the broader hazards/social science research realm that has implications for hurricane planning and risk communication, particularly the development and dissemination of hurricane forecast products.},

   abstract = {Verification was performed on ensemble forecasts of 2009 Northern Hemisphere summer tropical cyclones (TCs) from two experimental global numerical weather prediction ensemble prediction systems (EPSs). The first model was a high-resolution version (T382L64) of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS). The second model was a 30-km version of the experimental NOAA/Earth System Research Laboratory's Flow-following finite-volume Icosahedral Model (FIM). Both models were initialized with the first 20 members of a 60-member ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) using the T382L64 GFS. The GFS-EnKF assimilated the full observational data stream that was normally assimilated into the NCEP operational Global Statistical Interpolation (GSI) data assimilation, plus human-synthesized "observations" of tropical cyclone central pressure and position produced at the National Hurricane Center and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The forecasts from the two experimental ensembles were compared against four operational EPSs from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), NCEP, the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC), and the Met Office (UKMO). The errors of GFS-EnKF ensemble track forecasts were competitive with those from the ECMWF ensemble system, and the overall spread of the ensemble tracks was consistent in magnitude with the track error. Both experimental EPSs had much lower errors than the operational NCEP, UKMO, and CMC EPSs, but the FIM-EnKF tracks were somewhat less accurate than the GFS-EnKF. The ensemble forecasts were often stretched in particular directions, and not necessarily along or across track. The better-performing EPSs provided useful information on potential track error anisotropy. While the GFS-EnKF initialized relatively deep vortices by assimilating the TC central pressure estimate, the model storms filled during the subsequent 24 h. Other forecast models also systematically underestimated TC intensity (e.g., maximum forecast surface wind speed). The higher-resolution models generally had less bias. Analyses were conducted to try to understand whether the additional central pressure observation, the EnKF, or the extra resolution was most responsible for the decrease in track error of the experimental Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS)-EnKF over the operational NCEP. The assimilation of the additional TC observations produced only a small change in deterministic track forecasts initialized with the GSI. The T382L64 GFS-EnKF ensemble was used to initialize a T126L28 ensemble forecast to facilitate a comparison with the operationalNCEP system. The T126L28GFS-EnKFEPS track forecasts were dramatically better than the NCEP operational, suggesting the positive impact of the EnKF, perhaps through improved steering flow. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

Within the past 15 years this region has experienced Hurricane Isabel in 2003, Hurricane Irene in 2011 and several tropical storms. The region was also impacted by post-tropical Sandy in 2012. The perception of hurricane hazards among residents of the mid-Atlantic region has not been directly researched. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on the comprehension of information from hurricane warning graphics that influences hazard perception. This research used a total of eight hypothetical scenarios (four pairs) that varied storm track and storm size to assess risk perception of hurricane hazards and characteristics. Each scenario was represented using a four-panelled map featuring the National Hurricane Center's cone of uncertainty, a new storm surge map and a new damaging wind map created by the authors. A Qualtrics survey was used to collect responses to questions about concern for personal harm and evacuation intent. Residents of the region perceived falling trees, potential for damaging winds and the size of the storm to be the greatest threats. Scenarios depicting larger storms with track lines that moved inland were seen as more hazardous, resulting in greater concern and evacuation intent. Coastal residents showed greater concern about distance from the track for all scenarios and greater evacuation intent for larger storms compared to inland residents.},

   abstract = {Though most hurricane evacuation studies have focused on residents, tourists are also a vulnerable population. To assess their perceptions of risk and evacuation likelihood under different hurricane conditions, we surveyed 448 tourists visiting central Florida. Respondents viewed four maps emulating track forecast cones produced by the National Hurricane Center and text information featuring variations of storm intensity, coast of landfall, centerline position relative to the survey site, time until landfall, and event duration. We performed chi-square tests to determine which hurricane conditions, and aspects of tourists such as their demographics and previous hurricane experience, most likely influenced their ratings of risk and evacuation likelihood for respondents located on Pinellas County beaches or inland near Orlando, FL. Highly rated scenarios featured a Category 4 hurricane making landfall along the Gulf Coast with the centerline passing over the sampling site. Overall, tourists that indicated the highest risk and evacuation ratings were not previously affected by a hurricane, had a trip duration of less than 6 days, and had checked for the possibility of a hurricane strike before departure. However, results for other tourist attributes differed between tourists in coastal and inland locations. We found that although somewhat knowledgeable about hurricanes, tourists misinterpreted the track forecast cone and hurricane conditions, which led to a lower perception of risk and subsequent likelihood to evacuate. Tourists, particularly those from outside of Florida, need to be better educated about the risks they face from hurricanes that make landfall.},

   abstract = {This article investigates the use of dynamic laboratory simulations as a tool for studying decisions to prepare for hurricane threats. A prototype web-based simulation named Stormview is described that allows individuals to experience the approach of a hurricane in a computer-based environment. In Stormview participants can gather storm information through various media, hear the opinions of neighbors, and indicate intentions to take protective action. We illustrate how the ability to exert experimental control over the information viewed by participants can be used to provide insights into decision making that would be difficult to gain from field studies, such as how preparedness decisions are affected by the nature of news coverage of prior storms, how a storm's movement is depicted in graphics, and the content of word-of-mouth communications. Data from an initial application involving a sample of Florida residents reveal a number of unexpected findings about hurricane risk response. Participants who viewed forecast graphics, which contained track lines depicting the most likely path of the storm, for example, had higher levels of preparation than those who saw graphics that showed only uncertainty cones-even among those living far from the predicted center path. Similarly, the participants who were most likely to express worry about an approaching storm and fastest to undertake preparatory action were those who, ironically, had never experienced one. Finally, external validity is evidenced by a close rank-order correspondence between patterns of information use revealed in the lab and that found in previous cross-sectional field studies. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.},

   abstract = {Objective: The purpose was to examine how participants understand, interpret, and make decisions using hurricane forecast graphics.    Design: A four-part online survey was administered.    Participants were provided an error cone graphic and one of three experimental potential for damaging winds graphics. Hurricane knowledge was also measured.    Subjects: Two hundred eighty-six individuals initially responded to the survey. A subset of the sample was used for analysis (N = 203, with 130 responding to questions in all four parts). The average age was 41.97 (SD 12.97) with a range from 18 to 75. The reduced sample was 56.7 percent female and 43.3 percent male.    Results: Responses were significantly different between those receiving the potential for damaging winds graphic and both other graphics. The addition of the error cone did not significantly change decision making. Perceived helpfulness of the forecast graphic increased with the addition of the track, but similarly, the addition of the error cone did not contribute significantly (means = 5.91, 7.78, 8.09). A majority of respondents answered five of the six hurricane knowledge questions correctly (62.1-79 percent). The lowest percentage knew what ingredients hurricanes needed to form (36.3 percent).    Conclusions: Track information significantly altered participants’ perceptions of risk from damaging winds, but the error cone did not. Hurricane knowledge was good, with misconceptions existing regarding the effectiveness of taping windows and the meaning of the term “major hurricane.” Understanding of the two forecast graphics was also good.},

In addition, an evaluation of a pair of CESM2 long preindustrial control and historical ensemble simulations is presented. These simulations were performed using the nominal 1° horizontal resolution configuration of the coupled model with both the “low-top” (40 km, with limited chemistry) and “high-top” (130 km, with comprehensive chemistry) versions of the atmospheric component. CESM2 contains many substantial science and infrastructure improvements and new capabilities since its previous major release, CESM1, resulting in improved historical simulations in comparison to CESM1 and available observations. These include major reductions in low-latitude precipitation and shortwave cloud forcing biases; better representation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation; better El Niño-Southern Oscillation-related teleconnections; and a global land carbon accumulation trend that agrees well with observationally based estimates. Most tropospheric and surface features of the low- and high-top simulations are very similar to each other, so these improvements are present in both configurations. CESM2 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.1–5.3 °C, larger than in CESM1, primarily due to a combination of relatively small changes to cloud microphysics and boundary layer parameters. In contrast, CESM2's transient climate response of 1.9–2.0 °C is comparable to that of CESM1. The model outputs from these and many other simulations are available to the research community, and they represent CESM2's contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6.},

   abstract = {While climate change mitigation targets necessarily concern maximum mean state changes, understanding impacts and developing adaptation strategies will be largely contingent on how climate variability responds to increasing anthropogenic perturbations. Here we present a new 100-member large ensemble of climate change projections conducted with the Community Earth System Model version 2 to examine the sensitivity of internal climate fluctuations to greenhouse warming. Our unprecedented simulations reveal that changes in variability, considered broadly in terms of probability distribution, amplitude, frequency, phasing, and patterns, are are ubiquitous and span a wide range of physical and ecosystem variables across many spatial and temporal scales. Greenhouse warming will in particular alter variance spectra of Earth system variables that are characterized by non-Gaussian probability distributions, such as rainfall, primary production or fire occurrence. Our modeling results have important implications for climate adaptation efforts, resource management, and for seasonal predictions.},

   abstract = {The ocean component of the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) is described, and its solutions from the twentieth-century (20C) simulations are documented in comparison with observations and those of CCSM3. The improvements to the ocean model physical processes include new parameterizations to represent previously missing physics and modifications of existing parameterizations to incorporate recent new developments. In comparison with CCSM3, the new solutions show some significant improvements that can be attributed to these model changes. These include a better equatorial current structure, a sharper thermocline, and elimination of the cold bias of the equatorial cold tongue all in the Pacific Ocean; reduced sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity biases along the North Atlantic Current path; and much smaller potential temperature and salinity biases in the near-surface Pacific Ocean. Other improvements include a global-mean SST that is more consistent with the present-day observations due to a different spinup procedure from that used in CCSM3. Despite these improvements, many of the biases present in CCSM3 still exist in CCSM4. A major concern continues to be the substantial heat content loss in the ocean during the preindustrial control simulation from which the 20C cases start. This heat loss largely reflects the top of the atmospheric model heat loss rate in the coupled system, and it essentially determines the abyssal ocean potential temperature biases in the 20C simulations. There is also a deep salty bias in all basins. As a result of this latter bias in the deep North Atlantic, the parameterized overflow waters cannot penetrate much deeper than in CCSM3. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {An objective approach is presented for scoring coupled climate simulations through an evaluation against satellite and reanalysis datasets during the satellite era (i.e., since 1979). The approach is motivated, described, and applied to available Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) archives and the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Version 1 Large Ensemble archives with the goal of robustly benchmarking model performance and its evolution across CMIP generations. A scoring system is employed that minimizes sensitivity to internal variability, external forcings, and model tuning. Scores are based on pattern correlations of the simulated mean state, seasonal contrasts, and ENSO teleconnections. A broad range of feedback-relevant fields is considered and summarized on discrete timescales (climatology, seasonal, interannual) and physical realms (energy budget, water cycle, dynamics). Fields are also generally chosen for which observational uncertainty is small compared to model structural differences. Highest mean variable scores across models are reported for well-observed fields such as sea level pressure, precipitable water, and outgoing longwave radiation, while the lowest scores are reported for 500 hPa vertical velocity, net surface energy flux, and precipitation minus evaporation. The fidelity of models is found to vary widely both within and across CMIP generations. Systematic increases in model fidelity in more recent CMIP generations are identified, with the greatest improvements occurring in dynamic and energetic fields. Such examples include shortwave cloud forcing and 500 hPa eddy geopotential height and relative humidity. Improvements in ENSO scores with time are substantially greater than for climatology or seasonal timescales. Analysis output data generated by this approach are made freely available online from a broad range of model ensembles, including the CMIP archives and various singlemodel large ensembles. These multimodel archives allow for an expeditious analysis of performance across a range of simulations, while the CESM large ensemble archive allows for estimation of the influence of internal variability on computed scores. The entire output archive, updated and expanded regularly, can be accessed at http://webext.cgd. ucar.edu/Multi-Case/CMAT/index.html (last access: 18 August 2020).},

   abstract = {This study presents a description of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) in a multicentury preindustrial simulation of the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2). The model simulates several aspects of ENSO relatively well, including dominant timescale, tropical and extratropical precursors, composite evolution of El Niño and La Niña events, and ENSO teleconnections. The good model representation of ENSO spectral characteristics is consistent with the spatial pattern of the anomalous equatorial zonal wind stress in the model, which results in the correct adjustment timescale of the equatorial thermocline according to the delayed/recharge oscillator paradigms, as also reflected in the realistic time evolution of the equatorial Warm Water Volume. PDV in the model exhibits a pattern that is very similar to the observed, with realistic tropical and South Pacific signatures which were much weaker in some of the CESM2 predecessor models. The tropical component of PDV also shows an association with ENSO decadal modulation which is similar to that found in observations. However, the ENSO amplitude is about 30% larger than observed in the preindustrial CESM2 simulation, and even larger in the historical ensemble, perhaps as a result of anthropogenic influences. In contrast to observations, the largest variability is found in the central Pacific rather than in the eastern Pacific, a discrepancy that somewhat hinders the model's ability to represent a full diversity in El Niño spatial patterns and appears to be associated with an unrealistic confinement of the precipitation anomalies to the western Pacific.},

   abstract = {To better understand global mean sea level (GMSL) as an indicator of climate variability and change, contributions to its interannual variation are quantified in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble and Last Millennium Ensemble. Consistent with expectations, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is found to exert a strong influence due to variability in rainfall over land (PL) and terrestrial water storage (TWS). Other important contributors include changes in ocean heat content (OHC) and precipitable water (PW). The temporal evolution of individual contributing terms is documented. The magnitude of peak GMSL anomalies associated with ENSO generally are of the order of 0.5 mm·K−1 with significant inter-event variability, with a standard deviation (σ) that is about half as large The results underscore the exceptional rarity of the 2010/2011 La Niña-related GMSL drop and estimate the frequency of such an event to be about only once in every 75 years. In addition to ENSO, major volcanic eruptions are found to be a key driver of interannual variability. Associated GMSL variability contrasts with that of ENSO as TWS and PW anomalies initially offset the drop due to OHC reductions but short-lived relative to them. Responses up to 25 mm are estimated for the largest eruptions of the Last Millennium.},

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 °C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017-2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018-2020 period.},

   abstract = {Fires have influenced atmospheric composition and climate since the rise of vascular plants, and satellite data have shown the overall global extent of fires. Our knowledge of historic fire emissions has progressively improved over the past decades due mostly to the development of new proxies and the improvement of fire models. Currently, there is a suite of proxies including sedimentary charcoal records, measurements of fire-emitted trace gases and black carbon stored in ice and firn, and visibility observations. These proxies provide opportunities to extrapolate emission estimates back in time based on satellite data starting in 1997, but each proxy has strengths and weaknesses regarding, for example, the spatial and temporal extents over which they are representative. We developed a new historic biomass burning emissions dataset starting in 1750 that merges the satellite record with several existing proxies and uses the average of six models from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP) protocol to estimate emissions when the available proxies had limited coverage. According to our approach, global biomass burning emissions were relatively constant, with 10-year averages varying between 1.8 and 2.3 PgC yr-1. Carbon emissions increased only slightly over the full time period and peaked during the 1990s after which they decreased gradually. There is substantial uncertainty in these estimates, and patterns varied depending on choices regarding data representation, especially on regional scales. The observed pattern in fire carbon emissions is for a large part driven by African fires, which accounted for 58% of global fire carbon emissions. African fire emissions declined since about 1950 due to conversion of savanna to cropland, and this decrease is partially compensated for by increasing emissions in deforestation zones of South America and Asia. These global fire emission estimates are mostly suited for global analyses and will be used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations.},

The increase in ECS over the previous version (CESM1) is the result of cloud feedbacks. Interim versions of CESM2 had a land model that damped ECS. Part of the ECS change results from evolving the model configuration to reproduce the long-term trend of global and regional surface temperature over the twentieth century in response to climate forcings. Changes made to reduce sensitivity to aerosols also impacted cloud feedbacks, which significantly influence ECS. CESM2 simulations compare very well to observations of present climate. It is critical to understand whether the high ECS, outside the best estimate range of 1.5–4.5 K, is plausible.},

Climatology was used when no information about the sea ice was available. Our main aim was to create a homogenous data set by calculating and applying bias adjustments using periods of overlaps between the different data sources used. National Ice Center charts from 1995 to 2007 have been used as a reference to achieve this. In particular, large bias adjustments have been applied to the passive microwave data in both the Antarctic and Arctic summers. Overall, HadISST.2.1.0.0 contains more ice than HadISST1.1, with higher concentrations, shorter marginal ice zones, and larger extents and areas in some regions and periods. A new method for estimating the concentrations within the ice pack using the distance from the ice edge has been developed and evaluated. This was used when only the extents were known or the original concentration fields were heterogeneous. A number of discontinuities in the HadISST1.1 record are no longer found in HadISST.2.1.0.0.},

   abstract = {This paper describes a new Sea surface temperature (SST) analysis that is produced with global coverage on a daily basis at the Met Office called the Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system. OSTIA uses satellite SST data provided by international agencies via the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) framework. GHRSST products include data from microwave and infrared satellite instruments with accompanying uncertainty estimates. The system also uses in situ SST data available over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and a sea-ice concentration product from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Applications Facility (OSI-SAF). The SST analysis is a multi-scale optimal interpolation that is designed for applications in numerical weather prediction and ocean forecasting systems. The background error covariance matrix is specified using ocean model data and the analysis uses correlation length scales of 10. km and 100. km. The OSTIA system produces a foundation SST estimate (SSTfnd, which is the SST free of diurnal variability) at an output grid resolution of 1/20° (~. 6. km) although the smallest analysis feature resolution is based on the correlation length scale of 10. km. All satellite SST data are adjusted for bias errors based on a combination of ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) SST data and in situ SST measurements from drifting buoys. Data are filtered (based on surface wind speed data) to remove diurnal variability and AATSR data are adjusted to represent the SST at the same depth as drifting buoy measurements (0.2-1. m) before bias adjustments are made. Global coverage outputs are provided each day in GHRSST L4 netCDF format. A variety of secondary products are also provided including weekly and monthly mean data sets. OSTIA products are continuously monitored and validation/verification activities demonstrate that SST products have zero mean bias and an accuracy of ~. 0.57. K compared to in situ measurements. OSTIA is now used operationally as a boundary condition for all weather forecast models at the Met Office and at European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). OSTIA is produced by the Met Office as part of the European Union Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) MyOcean project. © 2011.},

   abstract = {A complete map of the ocean subsurface temperature is essential for monitoring aspects of climate change such as the ocean heat content (OHC) and sea level changes and for understanding the dynamics of the ocean/climate variation. However, global observations have not been available in the past, so a mapping strategy is required to fill the data gaps. In this study, an advanced mapping method is proposed to reconstruct the historical ocean subsurface (0-700 m) temperature field from 1940 to 2014 by using ensemble optimal interpolation with a dynamic ensemble (EnOI-DE) approach and a multimodel ensemble of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) historical and representative concentration pathway 4.5 simulations. The reconstructed field is a combination of two parts: a first guess provided by the ensemble mean of CMIP5 models and an adjustment by minimizing the analysis error with the assistance of error covariance determined by the CMIP5 models. The uncertainty of the field can also be assessed. This new approach was evaluated using a series of tests, including subsample tests by using data from the Argo period, idealized tests by specifying a truth field from the models, and withdrawn-data tests by removing 20% of the observations for validation. In addition, the authors showed that the ocean mean state, long-term trends, and interannual and decadal variability are all well represented. Furthermore, the most significant benefit of this method is to provide an improved estimate of the long-term historical OHC changes since 1940, which have important implications for Earth's energy budget.},

   abstract = {The rate of increase of global-mean surface air temperature (SAT g) has apparently slowed during the last decade. We investigated the extent to which state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs) can capture this hiatus period by using multimodel ensembles of historical climate simulations. While the SATg linear trend for the last decade is not captured by their ensemble means regardless of differences in model generation and external forcing, it is barely represented by an 11-member ensemble of a GCM, suggesting an internal origin of the hiatus associated with active heat uptake by the oceans. Besides, we found opposite changes in ocean heat uptake efficiency (κ), weakening in models and strengthening in nature, which explain why the models tend to overestimate the SATg trend. The weakening of κ commonly found in GCMs seems to be an inevitable response of the climate system to global warming, suggesting the recovery from hiatus in coming decades.

We test for 'pauses', both in the normally understood meaning of the term to mean no warming trend, as well as for a 'pause' defined as a substantially slower trend in GMST. The tests are carried out with the historical versions of GMST that existed for each pause-interval tested, and with current versions of each of the GMST datasets. The tests are conducted following the common (but questionable) practice of breaking the linear fit at the start of the trend interval ('broken' trends), and also with trends that are continuous with the data bordering the trend interval. We also compare results when appropriate allowance is made for the selection bias problem. The results show that there is little or no statistical evidence for a lack of trend or slower trend in GMST using either the historical data or the current data. The perception that there was a 'pause' in GMST was bolstered by earlier biases in the data in combination with incomplete statistical testing.},

Satellite-observed night lights are used to identify measurement stations located in extreme darkness and adjust temperature trends of urban and periurban stations for nonclimatic factors, verifying that urban effects on analyzed global change are small. Because the GISS analysis combines available sea surface temperature records with meteorological station measurements, we test alternative choices for the ocean data, showing that global temperature change is sensitive to estimated temperature change in polar regions where observations are limited. We use simple 12 month (and n × 12) running means to improve the information content in our temperature graphs. Contrary to a popular misconception, the rate of warming has not declined. Global temperature is rising as fast in the past decade as in the prior 2 decades, despite year-to-year fluctuations associated with the El Nio-La Nia cycle of tropical ocean temperature.

   abstract = {In recent years the global warming trend has plateaued, despite increasing anthropogenic emissions. Now research attributes this plateau to an increase in ocean heat uptake, through retrospective predictions of up to 5 years in length. The ability to hindcast this warming plateau strengthens our confidence in the robustness of climate models. Despite a sustained production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, the Earth’s mean near-surface temperature paused its rise during the 2000–2010 period1. To explain such a pause, an increase in ocean heat uptake below the superficial ocean layer2,3 has been proposed to overcompensate for the Earth’s heat storage. Contributions have also been suggested from the deep prolonged solar minimum4, the stratospheric water vapour5, the stratospheric6 and tropospheric aerosols7. However, a robust attribution of this warming slowdown has not been achievable up to now. Here we show successful retrospective predictions of this warming slowdown up to 5 years ahead, the analysis of which allows us to attribute the onset of this slowdown to an increase in ocean heat uptake. Sensitivity experiments accounting only for the external radiative forcings do not reproduce the slowdown. The top-of-atmosphere net energy input remained in the [0.5–1] W m−2 interval during the past decade, which is successfully captured by our predictions. Most of this excess energy was absorbed in the top 700 m of the ocean at the onset of the warming pause, 65% of it in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Our results hence point at the key role of the ocean heat uptake in the recent warming slowdown. The ability to predict retrospectively this slowdown not only strengthens our confidence in the robustness of our climate models, but also enhances the socio-economic relevance of operational decadal climate predictions.},

   abstract = {Incomplete global coverage is a potential source of bias in global temperature reconstructions if the unsampled regions are not uniformly distributed over the planet's surface. The widely used Hadley Centre-Climatic Reseach Unit Version 4 (HadCRUT4) dataset covers on average about 84% of the globe over recent decades, with the unsampled regions being concentrated at the poles and over Africa. Three existing reconstructions with near-global coverage are examined, each suggesting that HadCRUT4 is subject to bias due to its treatment of unobserved regions. Two alternative approaches for reconstructing global temperatures are explored, one based on an optimal interpolation algorithm and the other a hybrid method incorporating additional information from the satellite temperature record. The methods are validated on the basis of their skill at reconstructing omitted sets of observations. Both methods provide results superior to excluding the unsampled regions, with the hybrid method showing particular skill around the regions where no observations are available. Temperature trends are compared for the hybrid global temperature reconstruction and the raw HadCRUT4 data. The widely quoted trend since 1997 in the hybrid global reconstruction is two and a half times greater than the corresponding trend in the coverage-biased HadCRUT4 data. Coverage bias causes a cool bias in recent temperatures relative to the late 1990s, which increases from around 1998 to the present. Trends starting in 1997 or 1998 are particularly biased with respect to the global trend. The issue is exacerbated by the strong El Niño event of 1997-1998, which also tends to suppress trends starting during those years.},

Here using a 30-member ensemble simulation of a global Earth system model, we show that in 10% of all simulated decades with a global cooling trend, the eastern equatorial Pacific actually warms. This implies that there is a 1 in 10 chance that decadal hiatus periods may occur without the equatorial Pacific being the dominant pacemaker. In addition, the global ocean heat uptake tends to slow down during hiatus decades implying a fundamentally different global climate feedback factor on decadal time scales than on centennial time scales and calling for caution inferring climate sensitivity from decadal-scale variability.},

   abstract = {Global warming has stalled since the late 1990s, puzzling researchers; here a climate model that includes observed sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific reproduces the hiatus as part of natural variation, suggesting that long-term global warming is likely to continue. Global warming has largely stalled since the late 1990s, raising concerns regarding our understanding of climate sensitivity, the underlying mechanisms influencing climate variability and the ability of climate models to represent decadal variability. Yu Kosaka and Shang-Ping Xie show that the warming hiatus, including most of its seasonal and spatial aspects, can be resolved when observations of recently observed cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific are directly incorporated into a climate model. The results suggest that the current hiatus is a normal instance of internal climate variability, and that long-term warming is likely to resume as greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase. Despite the continued increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, the annual-mean global temperature has not risen in the twenty-first century1,2, challenging the prevailing view that anthropogenic forcing causes climate warming. Various mechanisms have been proposed for this hiatus in global warming3,4,5,6, but their relative importance has not been quantified, hampering observational estimates of climate sensitivity. Here we show that accounting for recent cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific reconciles climate simulations and observations. We present a novel method of uncovering mechanisms for global temperature change by prescribing, in addition to radiative forcing, the observed history of sea surface temperature over the central to eastern tropical Pacific in a climate model. Although the surface temperature prescription is limited to only 8.2% of the global surface, our model reproduces the annual-mean global temperature remarkably well with correlation coefficient r = 0.97 for 1970–2012 (which includes the current hiatus and a period of accelerated global warming). Moreover, our simulation captures major seasonal and regional characteristics of the hiatus, including the intensified Walker circulation, the winter cooling in northwestern North America and the prolonged drought in the southern USA. Our results show that the current hiatus is part of natural climate variability, tied specifically to a La-Niña-like decadal cooling. Although similar decadal hiatus events may occur in the future, the multi-decadal warming trend is very likely to continue with greenhouse gas increase.},

   abstract = {This study investigates global surface temperature data since 1920, and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation is found to be largely responsible for temperature fluctuations, exhibiting different spatial patterns to anthropogenic temperature drivers. Despite a steady increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), global-mean surface temperature (T) has shown no discernible warming since about 2000, in sharp contrast to model simulations, which on average project strong warming1,2,3. The recent slowdown in observed surface warming has been attributed to decadal cooling in the tropical Pacific1,4,5, intensifying trade winds5, changes in El Niño activity6,7, increasing volcanic activity8,9,10 and decreasing solar irradiance7. Earlier periods of arrested warming have been observed but received much less attention than the recent period, and their causes are poorly understood. Here we analyse observed and model-simulated global T fields to quantify the contributions of internal climate variability (ICV) to decadal changes in global-mean T since 1920. We show that the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) has been associated with large T anomalies over both ocean and land. Combined with another leading mode of ICV, the IPO explains most of the difference between observed and model-simulated rates of decadal change in global-mean T since 1920, and particularly over the so-called ‘hiatus’ period since about 2000. We conclude that ICV, mainly through the IPO, was largely responsible for the recent slowdown, as well as for earlier slowdowns and accelerations in global-mean T since 1920, with preferred spatial patterns different from those associated with GHG-induced warming or aerosol-induced cooling. Recent history suggests that the IPO could reverse course and lead to accelerated global warming in the coming decades.},

   abstract = {Closure of the Earth’s energy budget relies on strong aerosol cooling since 1998, if the same feedbacks apply for anthropogenic and natural variability. An analysis of climate model simulations suggests that these feedbacks are instead distinct. The Earth’s energy budget for the past four decades can now be closed1, and it supports anthropogenic greenhouse forcing as the cause for climate warming. However, closure depends on invoking an unrealistically large increase in aerosol cooling2 during the so-called global warming hiatus since the late 1990s (refs 3,4) that was due partly to tropical Pacific Ocean cooling5,6,7. The difficulty with this closure lies in the assumption that the same climate feedback applies to both anthropogenic warming and natural cooling. Here we analyse climate model simulations with and without anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, and show that top-of-the-atmosphere radiation and global mean surface temperature are much less tightly coupled for natural decadal variability than for the greenhouse-gas-induced response, implying distinct climate feedback between anthropogenic warming and natural variability. In addition, we identify a phase difference between top-of-the-atmosphere radiation and global mean surface temperature such that ocean heat uptake tends to slow down during the surface warming hiatus. This result deviates from existing energy theory but we find that it is broadly consistent with observations. Our study highlights the importance of developing metrics that distinguish anthropogenic change from natural variations to attribute climate variability and to estimate climate sensitivity from observations.},

   abstract = {Between about 1998 and 2012, a time that coincided with political negotiations for preventing climate change, the surface of Earth seemed hardly to warm. This phenomenon, often termed the ‘global warming hiatus’, caused doubt in the public mind about how well anthropogenic climate change and natural variability are understood. Here we show that apparently contradictory conclusions stem from different definitions of ‘hiatus’ and from different datasets. A combination of changes in forcing, uptake of heat by the oceans, natural variability and incomplete observational coverage reconciles models and data. Combined with stronger recent warming trends in newer datasets, we are now more confident than ever that human influence is dominant in long-term warming. Apparently contradictory conclusions regarding the ‘global warming hiatus’ are reconciled, strengthening the current scientific understanding that long-term global warming is extremely likely to be of anthropogenic origin. After a spike in global-mean temperature associated with the 1998 El Niño, the climate system experienced several years of reduced warming, and perhaps even slight cooling. This period, variously termed the 'hiatus', 'pause' or 'slowdown', should have come as no surprise given our understanding of El Niño and natural climate variability. However, soon after the recognition of the reduced warming, it appeared that models and observations were diverging, raising the question of whether the models were missing important processes. Although global warming has since recommenced, the hiatus sparked an enormous research effort. Iselin Medhaug et al. synthesize the literature and reassess the model and observational evidence. Their assessment reconciles the apparent contradictions between models and data and obviates the need to revise our understanding of the underlying physics of climate systems. The hiatus was an episode of natural variability after all.},

For a given global warming signal produced by a climate model ensemble, there exists an envelope of GMT values representing the range of possible unforced states of the climate system (the Envelope of Unforced Noise; EUN). Typically, the EUN is derived from climate models themselves, but climate models might not accurately simulate the correct characteristics of unforced GMT variability. Here, we simulate a new, empirical, EUN that is based on instrumental and reconstructed surface temperature records. We compare the forced GMT signal produced by climate models to observations while noting the range of GMT values provided by the empirical EUN. We find that the empirical EUN is wide enough so that the interdecadal variability in the rate of global warming over the 20th century does not necessarily require corresponding variability in the rate-of-increase of the forced signal. The empirical EUN also indicates that the reduced GMT warming over the past decade or so is still consistent with a middle emission scenario’s forced signal, but is likely inconsistent with the steepest emission scenario’s forced signal.},

Similar characteristics are investigated in the indices of both MPI-ESM1.1 and CESM1 ensemble models. The results further indicate no statistically significant lead-lag correlations between the unforced multidecadal climate modes originating from North Pacific (e.g., PDO) and North Atlantic (e.g., AMO), suggesting that a high correlation found in previous observational studies may be due to biased detrending approaches.},

   abstract = {Globally averaged surface air temperatures in some decades show rapid increases (accelerated warming decades), and in other decades there is no warming trend (hiatus decades). A previous study showed that the net energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere of about 1Wm22 is associated with greater increases of deep ocean heat content below 750m during the hiatus decades, while there is little globally averaged surface temperature increase or warming in the upper ocean layers. Here the authors examine processes involved with accelerated warming decades and address the relative roles of external forcing from increasing greenhouse gases and internally generated decadal climate variability associated with interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO). Model results from the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), show that accelerated warming decades are characterized by rapid warming of globally averaged surface air temperature, greater increases of heat content in the upper ocean layers, and less heat content increase in the deep ocean, opposite to the hiatus decades. In addition to contributions from processes potentially linked to Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), the positive phase of the IPO, adding to the response to external forcing, is usually associated with accelerated warming decades. Conversely, hiatus decades typically occur with the negative phase of the IPO, when warming from the external forcing is overwhelmed by internally generated cooling in the tropical Pacific. Internally generated hiatus periods of up to 15 years with zero global warming trend are present in the future climate simulations. This suggests that there is a chance that the current observed hiatus could extend for several more years. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

Here I present a review of indices and patterns of decadal climate variability in the Pacific from observations and palaeoclimate reconstructions. I examine the spatial characteristics of Pacific sea surface temperature variability and the metrics used to track observations of PDV. I find commonalities between the PDV patterns, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and its North and South Pacific counterparts, the Pacific Decadal and South Pacific Decadal Oscillations (PDO and SPDO). I present a tool to provide probabilistic quantification of the recent state of the IPO, and use the tool to provide reliable estimates of IPO state up to 2 years prior to the present. The tool indicates a probability of 80–90% that the IPO remained in its negative state until 2014–2015. I review palaeoclimate reconstructions of the IPO and PDO, and outline advances and challenges in our pre-instrumental understanding of PDV. I draw attention to a Pacific-wide tropical-extratropical mechanism that suggests that the cool and warm phases of PDV are not driven by tropical or extratropical variability alone, but are instead the result of continuous tropical-extratropical interactions on decadal timescales. I conclude by noting key sources of remaining uncertainty and emphasising the need to better understand decadal variability. This will occur through continual improvements in observations, an expansion of palaeoclimate exploration and data collection, and renewed efforts in model development.},

   abstract = {Initialized Earth System predictions are made by starting a numerical prediction model in a state as consistent as possible to observations and running it forward in time for up to 10 years. Skilful predictions at time slices from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), seasonal to interannual (S2I) and seasonal to decadal (S2D) offer information useful for various stakeholders, ranging from agriculture to water resource management to human and infrastructure safety. In this Review, we examine the processes influencing predictability, and discuss estimates of skill across S2S, S2I and S2D timescales. There are encouraging signs that skilful predictions can be made: on S2S timescales, there has been some skill in predicting the Madden–Julian Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation; on S2I, in predicting the El Niño–Southern Oscillation; and on S2D, in predicting ocean and atmosphere variability in the North Atlantic region. However, challenges remain, and future work must prioritize reducing model error, more effectively communicating forecasts to users, and increasing process and mechanistic understanding that could enhance predictive skill and, in turn, confidence. As numerical models progress towards Earth System models, initialized predictions are expanding to include prediction of sea ice, air pollution, and terrestrial and ocean biochemistry that can bring clear benefit to society and various stakeholders. Initialized climate predictions offer distinct benefits for multiple stakeholders. This Review discusses initialized prediction on subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), seasonal to interannual (S2I) and seasonal to decadal (S2D) timescales, highlighting potential for skilful predictions in the years to come.},

This variability is also seen in instrumental records, although the oscillatory nature of the variability is difficult to assess due to the short length of the instrumental record. The spatial pattern of this variability is hemispheric or perhaps even global in scale, but with particular emphasis on the Atlantic region. Independent analyses of multicentury integrations of two versions of the GFDL coupled atmosphere-ocean model also show the existence of distinct multidecadal variability in the North Atlantic region which resembles the observed pattern. The model variability involves fluctuations in the intensity of the thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic. It is our intent here to provide a direct comparison of the observed variability to that simulated in a coupled ocean-atmosphere model, making use of both existing instrumental analyses and newly available proxy based multi-century surface temperature estimates. The analyses demonstrate a substantial agreement between the simulated and observed patterns of multidecadal variability in sea surface temperature (SST) over the North Atlantic. There is much less agreement between the model and observations for sea level pressure. Seasonal analyses of the variability demonstrate that for both the model and observations SST appears to be the primary carrier of the multidecadal signal.},

While seeking explanations for the nearly steady global mean temperature from late 1990s through the early 2010s, the scientific community also grappled with concomitant and seemingly inconsistent changes in other metrics. For example, over that period, Arctic sea ice experienced a rapid decline but Antarctic sea ice expanded slightly, summertime warm extremes continued to rise without evidence of a pause, and the expanding Hadley cell trend maintained its course. In this article, we review recent advances in understanding the multidecadal variability of these metrics of global climate change, focusing on how internal multidecadal variability may reconcile differences between projected and recently observed trends and apparent inconsistencies between recent trends in some metrics. We emphasize that the impacts of global scale, naturally occurring patterns on multidecadal timescales, most notably the Pacific and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, tend to be more regionally heterogeneous than those of radiatively forced change, which weakens the relationship between local climate impacts and global mean temperature on multidecadal timescales. We conclude this review with a summary of current challenges and opportunities for progress.},

SPEAR (Seamless System for Prediction and EArth System Research) is built from component models recently developed at GFDL—the AM4 atmosphere model, MOM6 ocean code, LM4 land model, and SIS2 sea ice model. The SPEAR models are specifically designed with attributes needed for a prediction model for seasonal to decadal time scales, including the ability to run large ensembles of simulations with available computational resources. For computational speed SPEAR uses a coarse ocean resolution of approximately 1.0° (with tropical refinement). SPEAR can use differing atmospheric horizontal resolutions ranging from 1° to 0.25°. The higher atmospheric resolution facilitates improved simulation of regional climate and extremes. SPEAR is built from the same components as the GFDL CM4 and ESM4 models but with design choices geared toward seasonal to multidecadal physical climate prediction and projection. We document simulation characteristics for the time mean climate, aspects of internal variability, and the response to both idealized and realistic radiative forcing change. We describe in greater detail one focus of the model development process that was motivated by the importance of the Southern Ocean to the global climate system. We present sensitivity tests that document the influence of the Antarctic surface heat budget on Southern Ocean ventilation and deep global ocean circulation.

   abstract = {There is a growing need for skilful predictions of climate up to a decade ahead. Decadal climate predictions show high skill for surface temperature, but confidence in forecasts of precipitation and atmospheric circulation is much lower. Recent advances in seasonal and annual prediction show that the signal-to-noise ratio can be too small in climate models, requiring a very large ensemble to extract the predictable signal. Here, we reassess decadal prediction skill using a much larger ensemble than previously available, and reveal significant skill for precipitation over land and atmospheric circulation, in addition to surface temperature. We further propose a more powerful approach than used previously to evaluate the benefit of initialisation with observations, improving our understanding of the sources of skill. Our results show that decadal climate is more predictable than previously thought and will aid society to prepare for, and adapt to, ongoing climate variability and change. There is increasing demand for near-time climate predictions to provide guidance for adaptation planning at policy-relevant timescales. Although previous work has shown some skill in forecasting decadal surface temperature, it has proven more difficult to make predictions for precipitation and atmospheric circulation. By using a large, multi-model ensemble of climate models, a multi-institution team lead by Doug Smith of the Met Office Hadley Centre, UK were able to make skillful decadal predictions for near surface temperature, precipitation for the Sahel and broad swathes of Europe and Eurasia, and mean sea level pressure for many regions, with some exceptions being predictions for the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean. Further work is needed to understand whether the instances in which forecasts and observations differ are due to internal variability or external factors such as solar variability, volcanoes and anthropogenic aerosols.},

   abstract = {This Review considers recent advances in our understanding of regional climate change, critically discusses outstanding issues, and recommends targets for future research. Regional information on climate change is urgently needed but often deemed unreliable. To achieve credible regional climate projections, it is essential to understand underlying physical processes, reduce model biases and evaluate their impact on projections, and adequately account for internal variability. In the tropics, where atmospheric internal variability is small compared with the forced change, advancing our understanding of the coupling between long-term changes in upper-ocean temperature and the atmospheric circulation will help most to narrow the uncertainty. In the extratropics, relatively large internal variability introduces substantial uncertainty, while exacerbating risks associated with extreme events. Large ensemble simulations are essential to estimate the probabilistic distribution of climate change on regional scales. Regional models inherit atmospheric circulation uncertainty from global models and do not automatically solve the problem of regional climate change. We conclude that the current priority is to understand and reduce uncertainties on scales greater than 100 km to aid assessments at finer scales.},

The neural networks learn to use sea-surface temperature anomalies to predict future continental surface temperature anomalies. We then use a neural-network explainability method called layerwise relevance propagation to infer which oceanic patterns lead to accurate predictions made by the neural networks. In particular, regions within the North Atlantic Ocean and North Pacific Ocean lend the most predictability for surface temperature across continental North America. We apply the proposed methodology to decadal variability, although the concept is generalizable to other timescales of predictability. Furthermore, while our approach focuses on predictable patterns of internal variability within climate models, it should be generalizable to observational data as well.

Here, we provide a robust quantification of the relative contributions of anthropogenic, natural, and internally-driven decadal variability of global mean sea surface temperature (GMSST) by using a unique dataset consisting of 30-member large initial-condition ensembles with five Earth System Models (ESM-LE). We present evidence that a large fraction (~29–53%) of the simulated decadal-scale variance in individual timeseries of GMSST over 1950–2010 is externally forced and largely linked to the representation of volcanic aerosols. Comparison with the future (2010–2070) period suggests that external forcing provides a source of additional decadal-scale variability in the historical period. Given the unpredictable nature of future volcanic aerosol forcing, it is suggested that a large portion of decadal GMSST variability might not be predictable. Global mean sea surface surface temperature shows decadal fluctuations superimposed to the warming trend whose causes are still debated. Here, the authors provide a quantification of relative contributions of different drivers and conclude that both internal and externally-forced variability play a comparable role.},

   abstract = {Decadal climate predictions are being increasingly used by stakeholders interested in the evolution of climate over the coming decade. However, investigating the added value of those initialized decadal predictions over other sources of information typically used by stakeholders generally relies on forecast accuracy, while probabilistic aspects, although crucial to users, are often overlooked. In this study, the quality of the near-surface air temperature from initialized predictions has been assessed in terms of reliability, an essential characteristic of climate simulation ensembles, and compared to the reliability of noninitialized simulations performed with the same model ensembles. Here, reliability is defined as the capability to obtain a true estimate of the forecast uncertainty from the ensemble spread. We show the limited added value of initialization in terms of reliability, the initialized predictions being significantly more reliable than their noninitialized counterparts only for specific regions and the first forecast year. By analyzing reliability for different forecast system ensembles, we further highlight the fact that the combination of models seems to play a more important role than the ensemble size of each individual forecast system. This is due to sampling different model errors related to model physics, numerics, and initialization approaches involved in the multimodel, allowing for a certain level of error compensation. Finally, this study demonstrates that all forecast system ensembles are affected by systematic biases and dispersion errors that affect the reliability. This set of errors makes bias correction and calibration necessary to obtain reliable estimates of forecast probabilities that can be useful to stakeholders.},

   abstract = {Weather and climate variations on subseasonal to decadal time scales can have enormous social, economic, and environmental impacts, making skillful predictions on these time scales a valuable tool for decision-makers. As such, there is a growing interest in the scientific, operational, and applications communities in developing forecasts to improve our foreknowledge of extreme events. On subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scales, these include high-impact meteorological events such as tropical cyclones, extratropical storms, floods, droughts, and heat and cold waves. On seasonal to decadal (S2D) time scales, while the focus broadly remains similar (e.g., on precipitation, surface and upper-ocean temperatures, and their effects on the probabilities of high-impact meteorological events), understanding the roles of internal variability and externally forced variability such as anthropogenic warming in forecasts also becomes important. The S2S and S2D communities share common scientific and technical challenges. These include forecast initialization and ensemble generation; initialization shock and drift; understanding the onset of model systematic errors; bias correction, calibration, and forecast quality assessment; model resolution; atmosphere-ocean coupling; sources and expectations for predictability; and linking research, operational forecasting, and end-user needs. In September 2018 a coordinated pair of international conferences, framed by the above challenges, was organized jointly by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the World Weather Research Programme (WWRP). These conferences surveyed the state of S2S and S2D prediction, ongoing research, and future needs, providing an ideal basis for synthesizing current and emerging developments in these areas that promise to enhance future operational services.

   abstract = {Internal climate variability confounds estimates of the climate response to forcing but offers an opportunity to examine the dynamics controlling Earth’s energy budget. This study analyzes the time-evolving impact of modes of low-frequency internal variability on global-mean surface temperature (GMST) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation in preindustrial control simulations from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The results show that the slow modes of variability with the largest impact on decadal GMST anomalies are focused in high-latitude ocean regions, where they have a minimal impact on global TOA radiation. When these regions warm, positive shortwave cloud and sea ice–albedo feedbacks largely cancel the negative feedback of outgoing longwave radiation, resulting in a weak net radiative feedback. As a consequence of the weak net radiative feedback, less energy is required to sustain these long-lived temperature anomalies. In contrast to these weakly radiating high-latitude modes, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a large impact on the global energy budget, such that it remains the dominant influence on global TOA radiation out to decadal and longer time scales, despite its primarily interannual time scale. These results show that on decadal and longer time scales, different processes control internal variability in GMST than control internal variability in global TOA radiation. The results are used to quantify the impact of low-frequency internal variability and ENSO on estimates of climate sensitivity from historical GMST and TOA-radiative-imbalance anomalies.},

The incorporation of machine learning (ML) techniques offers exciting possibilities for advancing the capacity and speed of established methods and for making substantial and serendipitous discoveries. Beyond vast amounts of complex data ubiquitous in many modern scientific fields, the study of the ocean poses a combination of unique challenges that ML can help address. The observational data available is largely spatially sparse, limited to the surface, and with few time series spanning more than a handful of decades. Important timescales span seconds to millennia, with strong scale interactions and numerical modelling efforts complicated by details such as coastlines. This review covers the current scientific insight offered by applying ML and points to where there is imminent potential. We cover the main three branches of the field: observations, theory, and numerical modelling. Highlighting both challenges and opportunities, we discuss both the historical context and salient ML tools. We focus on the use of ML in situ sampling and satellite observations, and the extent to which ML applications can advance theoretical oceanographic exploration, as well as aid numerical simulations. Applications that are also covered include model error and bias correction and current and potential use within data assimilation. While not without risk, there is great interest in the potential benefits of oceanographic ML applications; this review caters to this interest within the research community.},

These three years are the three warmest on record in all but one of the datasets. The largest warming occurred over land, especially at high latitudes. Since the strong El Niño event that occurred in 2015/2016 was similar to the 1997/1998 El Niño, we compared the 2014–2016 period with 1998, the warmest year in the 20th century. The contribution to the annual mean surface temperature anomaly of climate variations at different time scales was assessed using ensemble empirical mode decomposition. Results based on the HadCRUT4 dataset suggest that the interannual component may have contributed an anomaly of −0.01°C in 2014, 0.12°C in 2015, and 0.06°C in 2016. These values are substantially lower than the contribution in 1998 (0.18°C). In comparison, the combined contribution of the decadal-to-multidecadal (DM) component and the long-term warming trend was 0.64°C in 2014, 0.70°C in 2015, and 0.77°C in 2016, which are substantially greater than that in 1998 (0.41°C). Similar results were obtained using the other four datasets. The larger contribution from the DM component and the long-term warming trend implies that warmer years like 2014–2016 may occur more frequently in the near future. We conclude that the so-called warming hiatus has faded away.},

   abstract = {Research into the mechanisms for the global warming slowdown or “hiatus” of 1998–2013 is reviewed here. Observational and modeling studies identify tropical Pacific sea surface temperature variability as a major pacemaker of global mean surface temperature (GMST) change, as corroborated by the GMST increase following a major El Niño event. Specifically, the decadal cooling of the tropical Pacific contributes to the recent global warming hiatus. This tropical Pacific pacemaker effect appears larger for decadal than interannual variability, but the decadal effect remains to be quantified from observations. Our critical review of the literature reveals that the internal and radiatively forced GMST changes are distinct in pattern, energetics, mechanism, and predictability. In contrast to greenhouse gas-induced warming that is spatially uniform in sign and driven by energy perturbations, internal variability in GMST is an order of magnitude smaller than spatial variations, for which ocean-atmosphere interaction is of first-order importance while planetary energetics is not. In fact, decadal variability in GMST is poorly correlated with net radiation at the top of the atmosphere, highlighting the need to distinguish internal and forced GMST change in planetary energy budget. While the planetary energy budget can now be closed observationally over multi-decadal periods, the recent hiatus highlights the need and challenges to measure and quantify decadal changes in both global ocean heat uptake (e.g., for the effect of radiative forcing on the hiatus) and heat redistribution in the ocean. Hiatus research has led to a wide recognition of the importance of internal variability for GMST trends over a decade and longer. The strengthened connection between the climate variability and change communities is an important legacy of hiatus research.},

In one perspective, we explore the physical mechanisms for sea surface temperature patterns and highlight the role of natural variability, particularly the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) that both have chaotic/random phases. In the other perspective, we investigate how the hiatus relates to changes in energy fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and to the three-dimensional distribution of ocean heat content change on decadal timescales. We find that the recent surface warming hiatus is associated with a transition of the IPO from a positive to negative phase and with heat redistribution between the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. The AMO has shifted to a positive phase since the late 1990s, inducing a La Niña-type response over the tropical Pacific via a tropic-wide teleconnection, contributing to the global warming hiatus.},

Its cold-phase shift around 1999, implicated as a driver for the early-2000s global warming slowdown, has been potentially linked to the Atlantic warming during the positive-phase Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV). However, the key mechanism for the trans-basin Atlantic-Pacific teleconnection remains debatable. Here, we show that an AMV-SST cooling can initiate a pan-Pacific response. The North Atlantic cooling induces westerly wind anomalies over the central-western equatorial Pacific as Kelvin-wave responses and easterly wind anomalies over the far-eastern equatorial Pacific as Rossby-wave responses. Additionally, anomalous lows are generated over the extratropical North and South Pacific through the midlatitude Rossby wave propagation. The tropical and midlatitude teleconnections act together to develop into a warm-phase IPO-like pattern through the wind-induced latent heat. Our results suggest a potential of advancing the predictability of IPO through a skillful simulation of AMV.},

The current 15-year event is found to have up to 25% chance of continuing for another 5 years. Since the end of the twentieth century, global mean surface temperature has not risen as rapidly as predicted by global climate models1,2,3 (GCMs). This discrepancy has become known as the global warming ‘hiatus’ and a variety of mechanisms1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 have been proposed to explain the observed slowdown in warming. Focusing on internally generated variability, we use pre-industrial control simulations from an observationally constrained ensemble of GCMs and a statistical approach to evaluate the expected frequency and characteristics of variability-driven hiatus periods and their likelihood of future continuation. Given an expected forced warming trend of ∼0.2 K per decade, our constrained ensemble of GCMs implies that the probability of a variability-driven 10-year hiatus is ∼10%, but less than 1% for a 20-year hiatus. Although the absolute probability of a 20-year hiatus is small, the probability that an existing 15-year hiatus will continue another five years is much higher (up to 25%). Therefore, given the recognized contribution of internal climate variability to the reduced rate of global warming during the past 15 years, we should not be surprised if the current hiatus continues until the end of the decade. Following the termination of a variability-driven hiatus, we also show that there is an increased likelihood of accelerated global warming associated with release of heat from the sub-surface ocean and a reversal of the phase of decadal variability in the Pacific Ocean.},

The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of 38 CMIP5 climate models to provide further evidence that models produce warming hiatus periods during warming experiments. GST rates are simulated in each model for the 21st century using two experiments: a moderate warming scenario (RCP4.5) and high-end scenario (RCP8.5). Warming hiatus periods are identified in model simulations by detecting (1) ≥15-year periods lacking a statistically meaningful trend and (2) rapid changes in the GST rate which resemble the observed 1998–2012 hiatus. Under the RCP4.5 experiment, all tested models produce warming hiatus periods. However, once radiative forcing exceeds 5 W/m 2 —about 2°C GST increase—as simulated in the RCP8.5 experiment after 2050, nearly all models produce only positive warming trends. All models show evidence of rapid changes in the GST rate resembling the observed hiatus, showing that the climate variations associated with warming hiatus periods are still evident in the models, even under accelerated warming conditions.},

The CNN correctly identifies 91% of observed precipitation extremes based on daily sea level pressure and 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies. There is evidence of increasing frequency of extreme precipitation circulation patterns (EPCPs) over the past two decades, although frequency changes are insignificant over the past four decades.

   abstract = {The North Atlantic ocean is key to climate through its role in heat transport and storage. Climate models suggest that the circulation is weakening but the physical drivers of this change are poorly constrained. Here, the root mechanisms are revealed with the explicitly transparent machine learning (ML) method Tracking global Heating with Ocean Regimes (THOR). Addressing the fundamental question of the existence of dynamical coherent regions, THOR identifies these and their link to distinct currents and mechanisms such as the formation regions of deep water masses, and the location of the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current. Beyond a black box approach, THOR is engineered to elucidate its source of predictive skill rooted in physical understanding. A labeled data set is engineered using an explicitly interpretable equation transform and k-means application to model data, allowing theoretical inference. A multilayer perceptron is then trained, explaining its skill using a combination of layerwise relevance propagation and theory. With abrupt CO2 quadrupling, the circulation weakens due to a shift in deep water formation regions, a northward shift of the Gulf Stream and an eastward shift in the North Atlantic Current. If CO2 is increased 1% yearly, similar but weaker patterns emerge influenced by natural variability.

THOR constitutes a step toward trustworthy ML called for within oceanography and beyond, as its predictions are physically tractable.},

   abstract = {In some decades, such as 2000–2009, the observed globally averaged surface-temperature time series has shown a flat or slightly negative trend. A modelling study provides evidence that heat uptake by the deep ocean may cause these hiatus periods and may be linked to La Niña-like conditions. There have been decades, such as 2000–2009, when the observed globally averaged surface-temperature time series shows little increase or even a slightly negative trend1 (a hiatus period). However, the observed energy imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere for this recent decade indicates that a net energy flux into the climate system of about 1 W m−2 (refs 2, 3) should be producing warming somewhere in the system4,5. Here we analyse twenty-first-century climate-model simulations that maintain a consistent radiative imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere of about 1 W m−2 as observed for the past decade. Eight decades with a slightly negative global mean surface-temperature trend show that the ocean above 300 m takes up significantly less heat whereas the ocean below 300 m takes up significantly more, compared with non-hiatus decades. The model provides a plausible depiction of processes in the climate system causing the hiatus periods, and indicates that a hiatus period is a relatively common climate phenomenon and may be linked to La Niña-like conditions.},

   abstract = {We present a new version of the Met Office Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit global surface temperature data set, HadCRUT5. HadCRUT5 presents monthly average near-surface temperature anomalies, relative to the 1961–1990 period, on a regular 5° latitude by 5° longitude grid from 1850 to 2018. HadCRUT5 is a combination of sea-surface temperature (SST) measurements over the ocean from ships and buoys and near-surface air temperature measurements from weather stations over the land surface. These data have been sourced from updated compilations and the adjustments applied to mitigate the impact of changes in SST measurement methods have been revised. Two variants of HadCRUT5 have been produced for use in different applications. The first represents temperature anomaly data on a grid for locations where measurement data are available. The second, more spatially complete, variant uses a Gaussian process based statistical method to make better use of the available observations, extending temperature anomaly estimates into regions for which the underlying measurements are informative. Each is provided as a 200-member ensemble accompanied by additional uncertainty information. The combination of revised input data sets and statistical analysis results in greater warming of the global average over the course of the whole record. In recent years, increased warming results from an improved representation of Arctic warming and a better understanding of evolving biases in SST measurements from ships. These updates result in greater consistency with other independent global surface temperature data sets, despite their different approaches to data set construction, and further increase confidence in our understanding of changes seen.},

The reliability of models' simulations is often gauged by their ability to reproduce the historical climate across many time scales. This study compares the global mean surface air temperature from 29 CMIP6 models with observations from three datasets. We examine (1) warming and cooling rates in five subperiods from 1880 to 2014, (2) autocorrelation and long-term persistence, (3) models' performance based on probabilistic and entropy metrics, and (4) the distributional shape of temperature. All models simulate the observed long-term warming trend from 1880 to 2014. The late twentieth century warming (1975–2014) and the hiatus (1942–1975) are replicated by most models. The post-1998 warming is overestimated in 90% of the simulations. Only six out of 29 models reproduce the observed long-term persistence. All models show differences in distributional shape when compared with observations. Varying performance across metrics reveals the challenge to determine the “best” model. Thus, we argue that models should be selected, based on case-specific metrics, depending on the intended use. Metrics proposed here facilitate a comprehensive assessment for various applications.},

   abstract = {This study examines historical simulations of ENSO in the E3SM-1-0, CESM2, and GFDL-CM4 climate models, provided by three leading U.S. modeling centers as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). These new models have made substantial progress in simulating ENSO’s key features, including: amplitude; timescale; spatial patterns; phase-locking; spring persistence barrier; and recharge oscillator dynamics. However, some important features of ENSO are still a challenge to simulate. In the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, the models’ weaker-than-observed subsurface zonal current anomalies and zonal temperature gradient anomalies serve to weaken the nonlinear zonal advection of subsurface temperatures, leading to insufficient warm/cold asymmetry of ENSO’s sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA). In the western equatorial Pacific, the models’ excessive simulated zonal SST gradients amplify their zonal temperature advection, causing their SSTA to extend farther west than observed. The models underestimate both ENSO’s positive dynamic feedbacks (due to insufficient zonal wind stress responses to SSTA) and its thermodynamic damping (due to insufficient convective cloud shading of eastern Pacific SSTA during warm events); compensation between these biases leads to realistic linear growth rates for ENSO, but for somewhat unrealistic reasons. The models also exhibit stronger-than-observed feedbacks onto eastern equatorial Pacific SSTAs from thermocline depth anomalies, which accelerates the transitions between events and shortens the simulated ENSO period relative to observations. Implications for diagnosing and simulating ENSO in climate models are discussed.},

   abstract = {Reduced-order dynamical models play a central role in developing our understanding of predictability of climate irrespective of whether we are dealing with the actual climate system or surrogate climate models. In this context, the linear inverse modeling (LIM) approach, by capturing a few essential interactions between dynamical components of the full system, has proven valuable in providing insights into predictability of the full system. We demonstrate that reservoir computing (RC), a form of learning suitable for systems with chaotic dynamics, provides an alternative nonlinear approach that improves on the predictive skill of the LIM approach. We do this in the example setting of predicting sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic in the preindustrial control simulation of a popular earth system model, the Community Earth System Model so that we can compare the performance of the new RC-based approach with the traditional LIM approach both when learning data are plentiful and when such data are more limited. The improved predictive skill of the RC approach over a wide range of conditions—larger number of retained EOF coefficients, extending well into the limited data regime, etc.—suggests that this machine-learning technique may have a use in climate predictability studies. While the possibility of developing a climate emulator—the ability to continue the evolution of the system on the attractor long after failing to be able to track the reference trajectory—is demonstrated in the Lorenz-63 system, it is suggested that further development of the RC approach may permit such uses of the new approach in more realistic predictability studies.},

Robust, long-lead forecasts would therefore be valuable for managing policy responses. But despite decades of effort, forecasting ENSO events at lead times of more than one year remains problematic2. Here we show that a statistical forecast model employing a deep-learning approach produces skilful ENSO forecasts for lead times of up to one and a half years. To circumvent the limited amount of observation data, we use transfer learning to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) first on historical simulations3 and subsequently on reanalysis from 1871 to 1973. During the validation period from 1984 to 2017, the all-season correlation skill of the Nino3.4 index of the CNN model is much higher than those of current state-of-the-art dynamical forecast systems. The CNN model is also better at predicting the detailed zonal distribution of sea surface temperatures, overcoming a weakness of dynamical forecast models. A heat map analysis indicates that the CNN model predicts ENSO events using physically reasonable precursors. The CNN model is thus a powerful tool for both the prediction of ENSO events and for the analysis of their associated complex mechanisms. A statistical forecast model using a deep-learning approach produces useful forecasts of El Niño/Southern Oscillation events with lead times of up to one and a half years.},

@article{Liu2021a,
   abstract = {However, the dynamic model forecasting of the IOD at lead times longer than 3 months exhibits very limited skill, though some studies indicate that predicting the IOD 7 months in advance is theoretically possible (Becker et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2012; Wu & Tang, 2019); this indicates that more meaningful precursors for IOD development must be discovered. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) of deep learning are nonlinear in nature and excel at processing spatial architectures (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; LeCun et al., 2015; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014), for example, SSTA or heat content (HC) patterns, which makes them compatible for unveiling implications between current climate conditions and their ensuing evolution. Furthermore, the successful application of deep learning in climate science, such as multi-year ENSO forecasts (Ham et al., 2019), rainfall prediction (Lee et al., 2018; Sahai et al., 2000), and the downscaling of parameters (Rasp et al., 2018) in climate models, has inspired the authors of the present study to review the significance of statistical methods. Considering deep learning techniques as a new methodology of statistical refinement based on climatic information, this study presents an attempt to forecast the IOD using CNNs with SSTA maps derived from reanalysis data. For comparison , IOD prediction by dynamic models in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) (Kirtman et al., 2014), an experimental multi-model seasonal forecasting system consisting of coupled models from research and operational centers in the USA and Canada (see Section 3), is examined as well. Also note that when it comes to the predictability of the IOD, there has been a long debate concerning the physical relation between ENSO and IOD. Some studies indicate that the IOD is an intrinsic climate variability independent of the ENSO (Behera et al., 2006; Saji et al., 1999; Webster et al., 1999), while some others argue that IOD can be externally forced by ENSO (Stuecker et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019). There is no doubt that the ENSO has its influence on the IOD, but the way in which ENSO operates is still under investigation (to drive the IOD, to enhance/weaken the IOD or both). In addition, the architecture and algorithm of the classic CNN model make it difficult to balance the contribution to the predicted Dipole Mode Index (DMI) between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, if a global SSTA map is used as input (see Supporting Information S1). Thus, as a preliminary exploration of CNN-based IOD forecasts, we initiate the IOD prediction only using the Indian Ocean SSTA in this study. 2. Methods 2.1. Deep Learning Techniques The architecture of CNN applied in this study is shown in Figure S4 in Supporting Information S1. Our CNN model has two convolutional layers and two average pooling layers. The number of filters in each convolutional layer varies from 10 to 12. The average pooling layer extract features in 2 × 2 grid while the filters do in 3 × 3 grid. Subsequent fully connected layer has 8-10 neurons. The final output layer is in one-dimension as a regression is needed to produce a DMI. So there exists 27 combinations of architecture of CNN models, which are C10C10D8, C10C10D9, C10C10D10, C10C11D8, etc. (C and D denote convolu-tional layer and fully connected layer, respectively). The batch (the number of samples we feed the CNN one updating step) of every updating step is 24 (We tried 12, 24, 48, and whole batch. The results are all alike so you can select whichever you prefer.). However, the learning rate (LR) is quite important, which needs to be dealt with carefully. For each one of those 27 CNN models, we apply a range of LR from 0.05 to 0.0001 to train them (the specific LRs are 0.05, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01, 0.009, 0.008, 0.007, 0.006, 0.005, 0.004, 0.003, 0.002, 0.001, 0.0009, 0.0008, 0.0007, 0.0006, 0.0005, and 0.0001). It is clear that different architecture of CNN model favors different LRs to yield their highest skills. After the training period, we choose the model with the highest skill to produce DMI in validation period for each one of those 27 CNN models. Though our test proves that every single CNN model can predict IOD well, the ensemble mean of output of 27 CNN models is still used as the final predicted DMI. The required software for deep learning are Python 3.6, Keras 2.3.0, TensorFlow 2.2.0, NumPy 1.17.0, SciPy 1.4.1, and MATLAB 2018. The required software for plotting figures are Matplotlib 3.0.0 and Basemap 1.2.1.},

To circumvent this issue, here we explore the feasibility of training various machine learning approaches on a large climate model ensemble, providing a long training set with physically consistent model realizations. After training on thousands of seasons of climate model simulations, the machine learning models are tested for producing seasonal forecasts across the historical observational period (1980-2020). For forecasting large-scale spatial patterns of precipitation across the western United States, here we show that these machine learning-based models are capable of competing with or outperforming existing dynamical models from the North American Multi Model Ensemble. We further show that this approach need not be considered a ‘black box’ by utilizing machine learning interpretability methods to identify the relevant physical processes that lead to prediction skill. Seasonal forecasting skill in machine learning methods that are trained on large climate model ensembles can compete with, or out-compete, existing dynamical models, while retaining physical interpretability.},

The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision. There has been a recent rise of interest in developing methods for ‘explainable AI’, where models are created to explain how a first ‘black box’ machine learning model arrives at a specific decision.

However, there are yet many open questions regarding the use of neural networks for working with meteorological images, such as best practices for evaluation, tuning, and interpretation. This article highlights several strategies and practical considerations for neural network development that have not yet received much attention in the meteorological community, such as the concept of receptive fields, underutilized meteorological performance measures, and methods for neural network interpretation, such as synthetic experiments and layer-wise relevance propagation. We also consider the process of neural network interpretation as a whole, recognizing it as an iterative meteorologist-driven discovery process that builds on experimental design and hypothesis generation and testing. Finally, while most work on neural network interpretation in meteorology has so far focused on networks for image classification tasks, we expand the focus to also include networks for image-to-image translation.},

   abstract = {The temporary slowdown in large-scale surface warming during the early 2000s has been attributed to both external and internal sources of climate variability. Using semiempirical estimates of the internal low-frequency variability component in Northern Hemisphere, Atlantic, and Pacific surface temperatures in concert with statistical hindcast experiments, we investigate whether the slowdown and its recent recovery were predictable. We conclude that the internal variability of the North Pacific, which played a critical role in the slowdown, does not appear to have been predictable using statistical forecast methods. An additional minor contribution from the North Atlantic, by contrast, appears to exhibit some predictability. While our analyses focus on combining semiempirical estimates of internal climatic variability with statistical hindcast experiments, possible implications for initialized model predictions are also discussed.},

The DCPP makes use of past experience in simulating and predicting decadal variability and forced climate change gained from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and elsewhere. It builds on recent improvements in models, in the reanalysis of climate data, in methods of initialization and ensemble generation, and in data treatment and analysis to propose an extended comprehensive decadal prediction investigation as a contribution to CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016) and to the WCRP Grand Challenge on Near Term Climate Prediction (Kushnir et al., 2016). The DCPP consists of three components. Component A comprises the production and analysis of an extensive archive of retrospective forecasts to be used to assess and understand historical decadal prediction skill, as a basis for improvements in all aspects of end-to-end decadal prediction, and as a basis for forecasting on annual to decadal timescales. Component B undertakes ongoing production, analysis and dissemination of experimental quasi-real-time multi-model forecasts as a basis for potential operational forecast production. Component C involves the organization and coordination of case studies of particular climate shifts and variations, both natural and naturally forced (e.g. the "hiatus", volcanoes), including the study of the mechanisms that determine these behaviours. Groups are invited to participate in as many or as few of the components of the DCPP, each of which are separately prioritized, as are of interest to them.<br><br>The Decadal Climate Prediction Project addresses a range of scientific issues involving the ability of the climate system to be predicted on annual to decadal timescales, the skill that is currently and potentially available, the mechanisms involved in long timescale variability, and the production of forecasts of benefit to both science and society.},

   abstract = {In a changing climate, there is an ever-increasing societal demand for accurate and reliable interannual predictions. Accurate and reliable interannual predictions of global temperatures are key for determining the regional climate change impacts that scale with global temperature, such as precipitation extremes, severe droughts, or intense hurricane activity, for instance. However, the chaotic nature of the climate system limits prediction accuracy on such timescales. Here we develop a novel method to predict global-mean surface air temperature and sea surface temperature, based on transfer operators, which allows, by-design, probabilistic forecasts. The prediction accuracy is equivalent to operational forecasts and its reliability is high. The post-1998 global warming hiatus is well predicted. For 2018–2022, the probabilistic forecast indicates a warmer than normal period, with respect to the forced trend. This will temporarily reinforce the long-term global warming trend. The coming warm period is associated with an increased likelihood of intense to extreme temperatures. The important numerical efficiency of the method (a few hundredths of a second on a laptop) opens the possibility for real-time probabilistic predictions carried out on personal mobile devices. Accurate near-term predictions of global temperatures are required to determine some of the key impacts of climate change. Here the authors develop a novel probabilistic forecast system that shows anomalously warm temperatures for the next years with increased risk of extreme warming.},

   abstract = {Accounting for natural decadal variability allows better prediction of short-term trends. This study looks at the ability of individual models, which are in phase with the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, to simulate the current global warming slowdown. The authors highlight that the current trend could have been predicted in the 1990s with this technique and the need for consistent hindcast skills to allow reliable decadal predictions. The slowdown in the rate of global warming in the early 2000s is not evident in the multi-model ensemble average of traditional climate change projection simulations1. However, a number of individual ensemble members from that set of models successfully simulate the early-2000s hiatus when naturally-occurring climate variability involving the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) coincided, by chance, with the observed negative phase of the IPO that contributed to the early-2000s hiatus. If the recent methodology of initialized decadal climate prediction could have been applied in the mid-1990s using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 multi-models, both the negative phase of the IPO in the early 2000s as well as the hiatus could have been simulated, with the multi-model average performing better than most of the individual models. The loss of predictive skill for six initial years before the mid-1990s points to the need for consistent hindcast skill to establish reliability of an operational decadal climate prediction system.},

Assuming bias in TAS has stabilized in the 10 year predictions, after bias adjustment, TAS anomalies for the 2016-2035 period in the 30 year predictions initialized in 2006 are about 16% less than the uninitialized projections. One contributing factor for the improved climate simulation is the bias adjustment, which corrects the models' systematic errors and higher-than-observed decadal warming trend. Another important factor is the initialization with observations which constrains the ocean such that the starting points of the initialized simulations are close to the observed initial states.

Coordination has been achieved through the creation of new infrastructure, notably 11 Global Producing Centres (GPCs) for long-range forecasts, and definition of operational standards in forecast output and associated material. Examples discussed show improvements to the integration, usefulness and operational delivery of long-range forecast products to the world-wide climate community. Products are in wide use, and cover both predictive information, up to 6 mo ahead, and verification information indicating forecast quality. Proposals for future expansions of the role of GPCs are discussed, with a view to addressing the challenges presented by the development of the Global Framework for Climate Services. In particular, implementation of regular WMO-coordinated Global Seasonal Climate Updates is proposed, to provide authoritative, readily accessible advice on the state of the global climate and prospects for the next season. In addition we argue that the skill benefits provided by decadal-range predictions initialised with the observed climate state, relative to uninitialised (IPCC-type) predictions, are sufficient to begin similar international coordination in multiannual-to-decadal prediction, through extending the role of those GPCs that are developing decadalprediction capability. © Inter-Research 2011.},

The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of CESM2(CAM6) is 5.3°C, and CESM2(WACCM6) is 4.8°C, while the transient climate response (TCR) is 2.1°C in CESM2(CAM6) and 2.0°C in CESM2(WACCM6). Thus, these two CESM2 model versions have higher values of ECS than the previous generation of model, the CESM (CAM5) (hereafter CESM1), that had an ECS of 4.1°C, though the CESM2 versions have lower values of TCR compared to the CESM1 with a somewhat higher value of 2.3°C. All model versions produce credible simulations of the time evolution of historical global surface temperature. The higher ECS values for the CESM2 versions are reflected in higher values of global surface temperature increase by 2,100 in CESM2(CAM6) and CESM2(WACCM6) compared to CESM1 between comparable emission scenarios for the high forcing scenario. Future warming among CESM2 model versions and scenarios diverges around 2050. The larger values of TCR and ECS in CESM2(CAM6) compared to CESM1 are manifested by greater warming in the tropics. Associated with a higher climate sensitivity, for CESM2(CAM6) the first instance of an ice-free Arctic in September occurs for all scenarios and ensemble members in the 2030–2050 time frame, but about a decade later in CESM2(WACCM6), occurring around 2040–2060.},

This study is concerned with identifying and removing from global-mean temperatures the signatures of natural climate variability over the period January 1900-March 2009. A series of simple, physically based methodologies are developed and applied to isolate the climate impacts of three known sources of natural variability: the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), variations in the advection of marine air masses over the highlatitude continents during winter, and aerosols injected into the stratosphere by explosive volcanic eruptions. After the effects of ENSO and high-latitude temperature advection are removed from the global-mean temperature record, the signatures of volcanic eruptions and changes in instrumentation become more clearly apparent. After the volcanic eruptions are subsequently filtered from the record, the residual time series reveals a nearly monotonic global warming pattern since~1950. The results also reveal coupling between the land and ocean areas on the interannual time scale that transcends the effects of ENSO and volcanic eruptions. Globally averaged land and ocean temperatures are most strongly correlated when ocean leads land ~2-3 months. These coupled fluctuations exhibit a complicated spatial signature with largest-amplitude sea surface temperature perturbations over the Atlantic Ocean. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {The origins of the delayed increases in global surface temperature accompanying El Niño events and the implications for the role of diabatic processes in El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are explored. The evolution of global mean surface temperatures, zonal means and fields of sea surface temperatures, land surface temperatures, precipitation, outgoing longwave radiation, vertically integrated diabatic heating and divergence of atmospheric energy transports, and ocean heat content in the Pacific is documented using correlation and regression analysis. For 1950-1998, ENSO linearly accounts for 0.06°C of global surface temperature increase. Warming events peak 3 months after SSTs in the Niño 3.4 region, somewhat less than is found in previous studies. Warming at the surface progressively extends to about ±30° latitude with lags of several months. While the development of ocean heat content anomalies resembles that of the delayed oscillator paradigm, the damping of anomalies through heat fluxes into the atmosphere introduces a substantial diabatic component to the discharge and recharge of the ocean heat content. However, most of the delayed warming outside of the tropical Pacific comes from persistent changes in atmospheric circulation forced from the tropical Pacific. A major part of the ocean heat loss to the atmosphere is through evaporation and thus is realized in the atmosphere as latent heating in precipitation, which drives teleconnections. Reduced precipitation and increased solar radiation in Australia, Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and northern South America contribute to surface warming that peaks several months after the El Niño event. Teleconnections contribute to the extensive warming over Alaska and western Canada through a deeper Aleutian low and stronger southerly flow into these regions 0-12 months later. The 1976/1977 climate shift and the effects of two major volcanic eruptions in the past 2 decades are reflected in different evolution of ENSO events. At the surface, for 1979-1998 the warming in the central equatorial Pacific develops from the west and progresses eastward, while for 1950-1978 the anomalous warming begins along the coast of South America and spreads westward. The eastern Pacific south of the equator warms 4-8 months later for 1979-1998 but cools from 1950 to 1978.},

We consider retrospective decadal forecasts for nine cases, initiated at five year intervals, with the first beginning in 1961 and the last in 2001. Forecast ensembles of size thirty are generated from differing but similar initial conditions. We concentrate on the trends that remain after removing the following natural signals in observations and hindcasts: dynamically induced atmospheric variability, El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the effects of explosive volcanic eruptions. We show that ensemble mean errors in the decadal trend hindcasts are smaller than in a parallel set of uninitialized free running climate simulations. The ENSO signal, which is skillfully predicted out to a year or so, has little impact on our decadal trend predictions, and our modelling system possesses skill, independent of ENSO, in predicting decadal trends in global mean surface temperature.

In this chapter, model evaluation covers simulation of the mean climate, of historical climate change, of variability on multiple time scales and of regional modes of variability. This evaluation is based on recent internationally coordinated model experiments, including simulations of historic and paleo climate, specialized experiments designed to provide insight into key climate processes and feedbacks and regional climate downscaling. Figure 9.44 provides an overview of model capabilities as assessed in this chapter, including improvements, or lack thereof, relative to models assessed in the AR4. The chapter concludes with an assessment of recent work connecting model performance to the detection and attribution of climate change as well as to future projections. \{9.1.2, 9.8.1, Table 9.1, Figure 9.44\}},

This approach combines information from historical temperature data and state-of-the-art historical climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). We find that this sequence of record-breaking temperatures had a negligible (<0.03%) likelihood of occurrence in the absence of anthropogenic warming. It was still a rare but not implausible event (roughly 1–3% likelihood) taking anthropogenic warming into effect. The probability that three consecutive records would have been observed at some point since 2000 is estimated as ~30–50% given anthropogenic warming and <0.7% in its absence. The likelihood of observing the specific level of record warmth recorded during 2016 is no more than ~one-in-a-million neglecting anthropogenic warming, but as high as 27%, i.e., a nearly one-in-three chance of occurrence taking anthropogenic warming into account.},

   abstract = {The nature of rogue events is their unlikelihood and the recent unpredicted decade-long slowdown in surface warming, the so-called hiatus, may be such an event. However, given decadal variability in climate, global surface temperatures were never expected to increase monotonically with increasing radiative forcing. Here surface air temperature from 20 climate models is analyzed to estimate the historical and future likelihood of hiatuses and “surges” (faster than expected warming), showing that the global hiatus of the early 21st century was extremely unlikely. A novel analysis of future climate scenarios suggests that hiatuses will almost vanish and surges will strongly intensify by 2100 under a “business as usual” scenario. For “CO2 stabilisation” scenarios, hiatus, and surge characteristics revert to typical 1940s values. These results suggest to study the hiatus of the early 21st century and future reoccurrences as rogue events, at the limit of the variability of current climate modelling capability.},

   abstract = {Despite ongoing increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases, the Earth’s global average surface air temperature has remained more or less steady since 2001. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this slowdown in surface warming. A key component of the global hiatus that has been identified is cool eastern Pacific sea surface temperature, but it is unclear how the ocean has remained relatively cool there in spite of ongoing increases in radiative forcing. Here we show that a pronounced strengthening in Pacific trade winds over the past two decades—unprecedented in observations/reanalysis data and not captured by climate models—is sufficient to account for the cooling of the tropical Pacific and a substantial slowdown in surface warming through increased subsurface ocean heat uptake. The extra uptake has come about through increased subduction in the Pacific shallow overturning cells, enhancing heat convergence in the equatorial thermocline. At the same time, the accelerated trade winds have increased equatorial upwelling in the central and eastern Pacific, lowering sea surface temperature there, which drives further cooling in other regions. The net effect of these anomalous winds is a cooling in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1–0.2 °C, which can account for much of the hiatus in surface warming observed since 2001. This hiatus could persist for much of the present decade if the trade wind trends continue, however rapid warming is expected to resume once the anomalous wind trends abate. The slowdown in global average surface warming has recently been linked to sea surface cooling in the eastern Pacific Ocean. This work shows that strengthening trade winds caused a reduction in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1–0.2 °C. This may account for much of the warming hiatus and is a result of increased subsurface ocean heat uptake.},

   abstract = {Rossby waves that propagate westward on decadal timescales. This results in a build-up of ocean heat content in the off-equatorial western Pacific. If an ENSO event subsequently switches the sign of the tropical Pacific SST anomaly, this off-equatorial heat is redistributed via Kelvin waves throughout the equatorial region , leading to a transition in the PDO. Meehl et al. (2016) investigate this mechanism in the context of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO; similar to the PDO but the spatial domain spans the full meridional extent of the Pacific), finding that initialized hindcasts with the Community Climate System Model, Version 4, (CCSM4; Gent et al., 2011) show skill in simulating past IPO transitions with this mechanism appearing to coincide with those particular transitions. Since the PDO is considered the North Pacific manifestation of the IPO, the mechanism outlined above is directly relevant to understanding and predicting PDO transitions (Farneti et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2021). While stochastic climate models and LIMs model the climate system as linear, it has been suggested that predictive skill, especially of oceanic variability, could be gained using methods that better capture non-linearities in the system (Newman, 2007). Artificial neural networks (ANNs), a form of unsupervised machine learning, offer such a non-linear framework and have proven skillful at predicting processes in the climate system such as identifying the forced response to climate change, ENSO evolution and Madden -Julian Oscillation teleconnections (Barnes et al., 2020; Ham et al., 2019; Mayer & Barnes, 2021; Toms et al., 2020). Specifically in the case of oceanic predictability, Ham et al. (2019) used a convolutional neural network to predict ENSO evolution, showing significantly higher forecast skill than previous dynamical forecasts, while also identifying spatial SST patterns corresponding to increased predictability. Similarly, Nadiga (2021) demonstrated how reservoir computing (a form of recurrent neural networks) increases predictability of oceanic variability in the North Atlantic Ocean on the interannual timescale, especially during period of infrequent or missing data. Together, these studies suggest that neural networks are effective for Figure 1. (a) North Pacific PC 1 projected onto global de-seasoned SST.

   abstract = {Global mean surface and tropospheric temperatures have shown slower warming since 1998 than found in climate model simulations. A detailed analysis of observations and climate model simulations suggests that the observed influence of volcanic eruptions on tropospheric temperature has been significant, and that the discrepancy between climate simulations and observations is reduced by up to 15% when twenty-first century volcanic eruptions are accounted for in the models. Despite continued growth in atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases, global mean surface and tropospheric temperatures have shown slower warming since 1998 than previously1,2,3,4,5. Possible explanations for the slow-down include internal climate variability3,4,6,7, external cooling influences1,2,4,8,9,10,11 and observational errors12,13. Several recent modelling studies have examined the contribution of early twenty-first-century volcanic eruptions1,2,4,8 to the muted surface warming. Here we present a detailed analysis of the impact of recent volcanic forcing on tropospheric temperature, based on observations as well as climate model simulations. We identify statistically significant correlations between observations of stratospheric aerosol optical depth and satellite-based estimates of both tropospheric temperature and short-wave fluxes at the top of the atmosphere. We show that climate model simulations without the effects of early twenty-first-century volcanic eruptions overestimate the tropospheric warming observed since 1998. In two simulations with more realistic volcanic influences following the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, differences between simulated and observed tropospheric temperature trends over the period 1998 to 2012 are up to 15% smaller, with large uncertainties in the magnitude of the effect. To reduce these uncertainties, better observations of eruption-specific properties of volcanic aerosols are needed, as well as improved representation of these eruption-specific properties in climate model simulations.},

   abstract = {Natural multidecadal climate variability contributes to global mean surface temperature trends. This study quantifies those from the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, finding that the largest contributions are during the positive phase, which accelerates warming. Longer-term externally forced trends in global mean surface temperatures (GMSTs) are embedded in the background noise of internally generated multidecadal variability1. A key mode of internal variability is the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), which contributed to a reduced GMST trend during the early 2000s1,2,3. We use a novel, physical phenomenon-based approach to quantify the contribution from a source of internally generated multidecadal variability—the IPO—to multidecadal GMST trends. Here we show that the largest IPO contributions occurred in its positive phase during the rapid warming periods from 1910–1941 and 1971–1995, with the IPO contributing 71% and 75%, respectively, to the difference between the median values of the externally forced trends and observed trends. The IPO transition from positive to negative in the late-1990s contributed 27% of the discrepancy between model median estimates of the forced part of the GMST trend and the observed trend from 1995 to 2013, with additional contributions that are probably due to internal variability outside of the Pacific4 and an externally forced response from small volcanic eruptions5. Understanding and quantifying the contribution of a specific source of internally generated variability—the IPO—to GMST trends is necessary to improve decadal climate prediction skill.},

   abstract = {Three prominent quasi-global patterns of variability and change are observed using the Met Office's sea surface temperature (SST) analysis and almost independent night marine air temperature analysis. The first is a global warming signal that is very highly correlated with global mean SST. The second is a decadal to multidecadal fluctuation with some geographical similarity to the El Niño - Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It is associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and its Pacific-wide manifestation has been termed the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). We present model investigations of the relationship between the IPO and ENSO. The third mode is an interhemispheric variation on multidecadal timescales which, in view of climate model experiments, is likely to be at least partly due to natural variations in the thermohaline circulation. Observed climatic impacts of this mode also appear in model simulations. Smaller-scale, regional atmospheric phenomena also affect climate on decadal to interdecadal timescales. We concentrate on one such mode, the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This shows strong decadal to interdecadal variability and a correspondingly strong influence on surface climate variability which is largely additional to the effects of recent regional anthropogenic climate change. The winter NAO is likely influenced by both SST forcing and stratospheric variability. A full understanding of decadal changes in the NAO and European winter climate may require a detailed representation of the stratos here that is hitherto missing in the major climate models used to study climate change.},

   abstract = {The year 2015 was special for climate scientists, particularly for the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) research community, as a major El Niño finally materialized after a long pause since the 1997/1998 extreme El Niño. It was scientifically exciting since, due to the short observational record, our knowledge of an extreme El Niño has been based only on the 1982/1983 and 1997/1998 events. The 2015/2016 El Niño was marked by many environmental disasters that are consistent with what is expected for an extreme El Niño. Considering the dramatic impacts of extreme El Niño, and the risk of a potential increase in frequency of ENSO extremes under greenhouse warming, it is timely to evaluate how the recent event fits into our understanding of ENSO extremes. Here we provide a review of ENSO, its nature and dynamics, and through analysis of various observed key variables, we outline the processes that characterize its extremes. The 2015/2016 El Niño brings a useful perspective into the state of understanding of these events and highlights areas for future research. While the 2015/2016 El Niño is characteristically distinct from the 1982/1983 and 1997/1998 events, it still can be considered as the first extreme El Niño of the 21st century. Its extremity can be attributed in part to unusually warm condition in 2014 and to long-term background warming. In effect, this study provides a list of physically meaningful indices that are straightforward to compute for identifying and tracking extreme ENSO events in observations and climate models.},

   abstract = {In 2016, the dominant greenhouse gases released into Earth's atmosphere-carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide-continued to increase and reach new record highs. The 3.5 ± 0.1 ppm rise in global annual mean carbon dioxide from 2015 to 2016 was the largest annual increase observed in the 58-year measurement record. The annual global average carbon dioxide concentration at Earth's surface surpassed 400 ppm (402.9 ± 0.1 ppm) for the first time in the modern atmospheric measurement record and in ice core records dating back as far as 800000 years. One of the strongest El Niño events since at least 1950 dissipated in spring, and a weak La Niña evolved later in the year. Owing at least in part to the combination of El Niño conditions early in the year and a long-term upward trend, Earth's surface observed record warmth for a third consecutive year, albeit by a much slimmer margin than by which that record was set in 2015. Above Earth's surface, the annual lower troposphere temperature was record high according to all datasets analyzed, while the lower stratospheric temperature was record low according to most of the in situ and satellite datasets. Several countries, including Mexico and India, reported record high annual temperatures while many others observed near-record highs. A week-long heat wave at the end of April over the northern and eastern Indian peninsula, with temperatures surpassing 44°C, contributed to a water crisis for 330 million people and to 300 fatalities. In the Arctic the 2016 land surface temperature was 2.0°C above the 1981-2010 average, breaking the previous record of 2007, 2011, and 2015 by 0.8°C, representing a 3.5°C increase since the record began in 1900. The increasing temperatures have led to decreasing Arctic sea ice extent and thickness. On 24 March, the sea ice extent at the end of the growth season saw its lowest maximum in the 37-year satellite record, tying with 2015 at 7.2% below the 1981-2010 average. The September 2016 Arctic sea ice minimum extent tied with 2007 for the second lowest value on record, 33% lower than the 1981-2010 average. Arctic sea ice cover remains relatively young and thin, making it vulnerable to continued extensive melt. The mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet, which has the capacity to contribute ∼7 m to sea level rise, reached a record low value. The onset of its surface melt was the second earliest, after 2012, in the 37-year satellite record. Sea surface temperature was record high at the global scale, surpassing the previous record of 2015 by about 0.01°C. The global sea surface temperature trend for the 21st centuryto-date of +0.162°C decade-1 is much higher than the longer term 1950-2016 trend of +0.100°C decade-1. Global annual mean sea level also reached a new record high, marking the sixth consecutive year of increase. Global annual ocean heat content saw a slight drop compared to the record high in 2015. Alpine glacier retreat continued around the globe, and preliminary data indicate that 2016 is the 37th consecutive year of negative annual mass balance. Across the Northern Hemisphere, snow cover for each month from February to June was among its four least extensive in the 47-year satellite record. Continuing a pattern below the surface, record high temperatures at 20-m depth were measured at all permafrost observatories on the North Slope of Alaska and at the Canadian observatory on northernmost Ellesmere Island. In the Antarctic, record low monthly surface pressures were broken at many stations, with the southern annular mode setting record high index values in March and June. Monthly high surface pressure records for August and November were set at several stations. During this period, record low daily and monthly sea ice extents were observed, with the November mean sea ice extent more than 5 standard deviations below the 1981-2010 average. These record low sea ice values contrast sharply with the record high values observed during 2012-14. Over the region, springtime Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion was less severe relative to the 1991-2006 average, but ozone levels were still low compared to pre-1990 levels. Closer to the equator, 93 named tropical storms were observed during 2016, above the 1981-2010 average of 82, but fewer than the 101 storms recorded in 2015. Three basins-the North Atlantic, and eastern and western North Pacific-experienced above-normal activity in 2016. The Australian basin recorded its least active season since the beginning of the satellite era in 1970. Overall, four tropical cyclones reached the Saffir-Simpson category 5 intensity level. The strong El Niño at the beginning of the year that transitioned to a weak La Niña contributed to enhanced precipitation variability around the world. Wet conditions were observed throughout the year across southern South America, causing repeated heavy flooding in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Wetter-than-usual conditions were also observed for eastern Europe and central Asia, alleviating the drought conditions of 2014 and 2015 in southern Russia. In the United States, California had its first wetter-than-average year since 2012, after being plagued by drought for several years. Even so, the area covered by drought in 2016 at the global scale was among the largest in the post-1950 record. For each month, at least 12% of land surfaces experienced severe drought conditions or worse, the longest such stretch in the record. In northeastern Brazil, drought conditions were observed for the fifth consecutive year, making this the longest drought on record in the region. Dry conditions were also observed in western Bolivia and Peru; it was Bolivia's worst drought in the past 25 years. In May, with abnormally warm and dry conditions already prevailing over western Canada for about a year, the human-induced Fort McMurray wildfire burned nearly 590000 hectares and became the costliest disaster in Canadian history, with $3 billion (U.S. dollars) in insured losses.},

   abstract = {In this study, the authors investigate the connection between the South Pacific atmospheric variability and the tropical Pacific climate in models of different degrees of coupling between the atmosphere and ocean. A robust mode of variability, defined as the South Pacific meridional mode (SPMM), is identified in a multimodel ensemble of climate model experiments where the atmosphere is only thermodynamically coupled to a slab ocean mixed layer. The physical interpretation of the SPMM is nearly identical to the North Pacific meridional mode (NPMM) with the off-equatorial southeast trade wind variability altering the latent heat flux and sea surface temperature (SST) and initiating a wind-evaporation-SST feedback that propagates signals into the tropics. The authors also show that a positive cloud feedback plays a role in the development of this mode, but this effect is model dependent. While physically analogous to the NPMM, theSPMMhas a stronger expression in the equatorial Pacific and directly perturbs the zonal gradients of SST and sea level pressure (SLP) on the equator, thus leading to ENSO-like variability despite the lack of ocean-atmosphere dynamical coupling. Further analysis suggests that the SPMM is also active in fully coupled climate models and observations. This study highlights the important role of the Southern Hemisphere in tropical climate variability and suggests that including observations from the data-poor South Pacific could improve the ENSO predictability. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {This paper reviews recent progress in understanding of the North Pacific Meridional Mode (NPMM) and its influence on the timing, magnitude, flavor, and intensity of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The NPMM is a seasonally evolving mode of coupled climate variability and features several distinct opportunities to influence ENSO. They include: (1) A Wind-Evaporation-SST (WES) feedback-driven propagation of surface anomalies onto the equator during boreal spring, (2) Trade Wind Charging (TWC) of equatorial subsurface heat content by NPMM-related surface wind stress curl anomalies in boreal winter and early spring, (3) The reflection of NPMM-forced ocean Rossby waves off the western boundary in boreal summer, and (4) A Gill-like atmospheric response associated with anomalous deep convection in boreal summer and fall. The South Pacific Meridional Mode (SPMM) also significantly modulates ENSO, and its interactions with the NPMM may contribute to ENSO diversity. Together, the NPMM and SPMM are also important components of Tropical Pacific Decadal Variability; however, future research is needed to improve understanding on these timescales. Since 1950, the boreal spring NPMM skillfully predicts about 15–30% of observed winter ENSO variability. Improving simulated NPMM-ENSO relationships in forecast models may reduce ENSO forecasting error. Recent studies have begun to explore the influence of anthropogenic climate change on the NPMM-ENSO relationship; however, the results are inconclusive.},

Here we report an analysis of observational data over the past 40 years, showing a dipole mode in the Indian Ocean: a pattern of internal variability with anomalously low sea surface temperatures off Sumatra and high sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean, with accompanying wind and precipitation anomalies. The spatio-temporal links between sea surface temperatures and winds reveal a strong coupling through the precipitation field and ocean dynamics. This air–sea interaction process is unique and inherent in the Indian Ocean, and is shown to be independent of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. The discovery of this dipole mode that accounts for about 12% of the sea surface temperature variability in the Indian Ocean—and, in its active years, also causes severe rainfall in eastern Africa and droughts in Indonesia—brightens the prospects for a long-term forecast of rainfall anomalies in the affected countries.},

   abstract = {The role of the Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) in the rapid phase transition of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has received much attention over the last few decades. However, the distinctive role of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and its underlying dynamics in controlling the rapid transition remains debatable, since it is difficult to isolate the sole effect of the IOD using observation. By conducting model experiments, this study demonstrated that the positive IOD cases could contribute to the rapid phase transition from El Niño to La Niña without the assistance of the Indian Ocean Basin–wide Mode. The westerly wind anomalies over the tropical western Pacific induced not only the El Niño phase via descending Kelvin waves in the equatorial eastern Pacific but also the SST cooling in the off-equatorial western Pacific via ascending Rossby waves. The positive feedback between the upwelling Rossby waves and cool SST maintained the Philippine Sea anticyclone anomalies. The accompanying easterly wind anomalies over the tropical western Pacific triggered upwelling oceanic Kelvin waves, leading to the occurrence of La Niña. This study shows the possible role of the IOD in the rapid phase transition of ENSO.},

   abstract = {Anomalies of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation in the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean Dipole often occur simultaneously. An analysis of observations and models suggests that, in addition, the negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole tends to occur 14 months before an El Niño event, with implications for El Niño predictability. El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) consists of irregular episodes of warm El Niño and cold La Niña conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean1, with significant global socio-economic and environmental impacts1. Nevertheless, forecasting ENSO at lead times longer than a few months remains a challenge2,3. Like the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean also shows interannual climate fluctuations, which are known as the Indian Ocean Dipole4,5. Positive phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole tend to co-occur with El Niño, and negative phases with La Niña6,7,8,9. Here we show using a simple forecast model that in addition to this link, a negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole anomaly is an efficient predictor of El Niño 14 months before its peak, and similarly, a positive phase in the Indian Ocean Dipole often precedes La Niña. Observations and model analyses suggest that the Indian Ocean Dipole modulates the strength of the Walker circulation in autumn. The quick demise of the Indian Ocean Dipole anomaly in November–December then induces a sudden collapse of anomalous zonal winds over the Pacific Ocean, which leads to the development of El Niño/La Niña. Our study suggests that improvements in the observing system in the Indian Ocean region and better simulations of its interannual climate variability will benefit ENSO forecasts.},

   abstract = {Uncertainty exists regarding the interaction between the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) where ENSO is normally expected to be the leading mode. Moreover, the effect of global warming on the relationship between these two modes remains unexplored. Therefore, we investigated the ENSO-IOD linkage for the years 1950-2014 using reanalysis data and high-resolution climate model simulations. The 1950-2014 period is of particular interest as rapid Indian Ocean warming since the 1950s has had a huge impact worldwide. Our results showed that the IOD had robust causal effects on ENSO, whereas the impact of ENSO on IOD exhibited lower confidence. All models demonstrated that the IOD was unlikely to have no causal effects on ENSO, whereas eight out of 15 studied models and the reanalysis data showed significant causal effects at the 10% significance level. The analyses provide new evidence that ENSO interannual variability might be forced by changes in Indo-Pacific Walker circulation induced by the IOD. Weak control of ENSO on the IOD is likely due to nonsignificant effects of ENSO on the western tropical Indian Ocean, implying that the rapid warming environment in the Indian Ocean may fundamentally modulate the relationship between the IOD and ENSO. We find high agreement between the models and reanalysis data in simulating the ENSO-IOD connection. These results indicate that the effects of the IOD on ENSO might be more significant than previously thought.},

   abstract = {The authors' previous dynamical study has suggested a link between the Indian and Pacific Ocean interannual climate variations through the transport variations of the Indonesian Throughflow. In this study, the consistency of this oceanic channel link with observations is investigated using correlation analyses of observed ocean temperature, sea surface height, and surface wind data. The analyses show significant lag correlations between the sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean in fall and those in the eastern Pacific cold tongue in the following summer through fall seasons, suggesting potential predictability of ENSO events beyond the period of 1 yr. The dynamics of this teleconnection seem not through the atmospheric bridge, because the wind anomalies in the far western equatorial Pacific in fall have insignificant correlations with the cold tongue anomalies at time lags beyond one season. Correlation analyses between the sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean and those over the Indo-Pacific basin suggest eastward propagation of the upwelling anomalies from the Indian Ocean into the equatorial Pacific Ocean through the Indonesian Seas. Correlations in the subsurface temperature in the equatorial vertical section of the Pacific Ocean confirm the propagation. In spite of the limitation of the short time series of observations available, the study seems to suggest that the ocean channel connection between the two basins is important for the evolution and predictability of ENSO. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

Here, an ANN is tasked with whether or not there will be a slowdown in the rate of the GMST trend by using maps of ocean heat content at the onset. Through a machine learning explainability method, we find the ANN is learning off-equatorial patterns of anomalous ocean heat content that resemble transitions in the phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in order to make slowdown predictions. Finally, we test our ANN on observed historical data, which further reveals how explainable neural networks are useful tools for understanding decadal variability in both climate models and observations.},

State of the art climate prediction uses Earth system models (ESMs), driven by systems of differential equations representing the laws of physics. Previously, these models have tended to underestimate Arctic sea ice loss. The issue is grave because accurate modeling is critical for economic, ecological, and geopolitical planning. We use machine learning techniques, including random forest regression and Gini importance, to show that the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) relies too heavily on just one of the ten chosen climatological quantities to predict September sea ice averages. Furthermore, E3SM gives too much importance to six of those quantities when compared to observed data.

   abstract = {<p><![CDATA[Abstract. While climate change mitigation targets necessarily concern maximum mean state changes, understanding impacts and developing adaptation strategies will be largely contingent on how climate variability responds to increasing anthropogenic perturbations. Thus far Earth system modeling efforts have primarily focused on projected mean state changes and the sensitivity of specific modes of climate variability, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. However, our knowledge of forced changes in the overall spectrum of climate variability and higher-order statistics is relatively limited. Here we present a new 100-member large ensemble of climate change projections conducted with the Community Earth System Model version 2 over 1850–2100 to examine the sensitivity of internal climate fluctuations to greenhouse warming. Our unprecedented simulations reveal that changes in variability, considered broadly in terms of probability distribution, amplitude, frequency, phasing, and patterns, are ubiquitous and span a wide range of physical and ecosystem variables across many spatial and temporal scales. Greenhouse warming in the model alters variance spectra of Earth system variables that are characterized by non-Gaussian probability distributions, such as rainfall, primary production, or fire occurrence. Our modeling results have important implications for climate adaptation efforts, resource management, seasonal predictions, and assessing potential stressors for terrestrial and marine ecosystems.]]></p>},

The motivation for defining the PDO index on HC300 stems from the following considerations: (i) a need to accentuate lower-frequency variations in the monitoring of PDO and (ii) to take into account variations in the temperatures associated with the PDO that extend throughout the upper ocean (and are modulated by the seasonal cycle of mixed layer variability). It is demonstrated that an HC300-based definition is better suited to encapsulate these characteristics in the PDO variability. The variability in an HC300-based definition is also contrasted with the traditional definition of the PDO based on SSTs.},

Here, we apply the Winton-Held two-layer model and show that the probability of the observed 2000–2012 hiatus period to arise from internal variability driven by white noise is larger if climate sensitivity is low. This is due to the delayed response of the oceans that cause the forced trend to increase faster with rising climate sensitivity than does natural variability, leading to a decreasing likelihood of observing the hiatus.

   abstract = {Using an energy budget approach to understanding decadal temperature trends, this study highlights that observational uncertainty exceeds energy–flux deviations that affect such trends. Thus the origin of recent warming slowdown is unidentifiable. During the first decade of the twenty-first century, the Earth’s surface warmed more slowly than climate models simulated1. This surface-warming hiatus is attributed by some studies to model errors in external forcing2,3,4, while others point to heat rearrangements in the ocean5,6,7,8,9,10 caused by internal variability, the timing of which cannot be predicted by the models1. However, observational analyses disagree about which ocean region is responsible11,12,13,14,15,16. Here we show that the hiatus could also have been caused by internal variability in the top-of-atmosphere energy imbalance. Energy budgeting for the ocean surface layer over a 100-member historical ensemble reveals that hiatuses are caused by energy-flux deviations as small as 0.08 W m−2, which can originate at the top of the atmosphere, in the ocean, or both. Budgeting with existing observations cannot constrain the origin of the recent hiatus, because the uncertainty in observations dwarfs the small flux deviations that could cause a hiatus. The sensitivity of these flux deviations to the observational dataset and to energy budget choices helps explain why previous studies conflict, and suggests that the origin of the recent hiatus may never be identified.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine existing deep learning techniques for addressing class imbalanced data. Effective classification with imbalanced data is an important area of research, as high class imbalance is naturally inherent in many real-world applications, e.g., fraud detection and cancer detection. Moreover, highly imbalanced data poses added difficulty, as most learners will exhibit bias towards the majority class, and in extreme cases, may ignore the minority class altogether. Class imbalance has been studied thoroughly over the last two decades using traditional machine learning models, i.e. non-deep learning. Despite recent advances in deep learning, along with its increasing popularity, very little empirical work in the area of deep learning with class imbalance exists. Having achieved record-breaking performance results in several complex domains, investigating the use of deep neural networks for problems containing high levels of class imbalance is of great interest. Available studies regarding class imbalance and deep learning are surveyed in order to better understand the efficacy of deep learning when applied to class imbalanced data. This survey discusses the implementation details and experimental results for each study, and offers additional insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Several areas of focus include: data complexity, architectures tested, performance interpretation, ease of use, big data application, and generalization to other domains. We have found that research in this area is very limited, that most existing work focuses on computer vision tasks with convolutional neural networks, and that the effects of big data are rarely considered. Several traditional methods for class imbalance, e.g. data sampling and cost-sensitive learning, prove to be applicable in deep learning, while more advanced methods that exploit neural network feature learning abilities show promising results. The survey concludes with a discussion that highlights various gaps in deep learning from class imbalanced data for the purpose of guiding future research.},

After outlining the statistical bases of these methods, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate their robustness with respect to violations of their statistical assumptions. One surprising outcome is that locally weighted partial least squares regression offers the best average results, thus outperforming even factor analysis, the theoretically most appealing of our candidate techniques.},

   abstract = {<p> There are heated debates on the existence of the global warming slowdown during the early 21 <sup>st</sup> century. Although efforts have been made to clarify or reconcile the controversy over the issue, it is not explicitly addressed, restricting the understanding of global temperature change particularly under the background of increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations. Here, using extensive temperature datasets, we comprehensively reexamine the existence of the slowdown under all existing definitions during all decadal-scale periods spanning 1990-2017. Results show that the short-term linear-trend dependent definitions of slowdown make its identification severely suffer from the period selection bias, which largely explains the controversy over its existence. Also, the controversy is further aggravated by the significant impacts of the differences between various datasets on the recent temperature trend and the different baselines for measuring slowdown prescribed by various definitions. However, when the focus is shifted from specific periods to the probability of slowdown events, we find the probability is significantly higher in the 2000s than in the 1990s, regardless of which definition and dataset are adopted. This supports a slowdown during the early 21 <sup>st</sup> century relative to the warming surge in the late 20 <sup>th</sup> century, despite higher greenhouse-gas concentrations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this decadal-scale slowdown is not incompatible with the centennial-scale anthropogenic warming trend, which has been accelerating since 1850 and never pauses or slows. This work partly reconciles the controversy over the existence of the warming slowdown and the discrepancy between the slowdown and anthropogenic warming. </p>},

Merging weather and climate prediction with Earth-system science is a new challenge that is of considerable scientific interest and societal relevance. There is increased societal interest in climate information for the next few decades to guide adaptation strategies. Initialized climate forecasts and scenario integrations with climate models can generate relevant climate information. Advances have been made to increase the prediction horizon of initialized forecasts to decades. The quality of long-term predictions relies on accurate simulation of slow components of the Earth system, accurate simulation of interactions between fast and slow processes in the Earth system, and the initialization procedures. The prediction problem lies at the heart of NWP. Hence, scientists working on decadal predictions can learn from experiences in initialization, perturbation, and verification in short-term-to-seasonal forecasting. Also, joint model development in NWP and Earth-system modeling can be mutually beneficial. Atmospheric model development is generally more advanced in NWP than in ESMs and new developments can also be implemented in Earth-system models. Conversely, NWP models increasingly include Earth-system components. These include modules of atmospheric composition and the land surface that are generally developed by Earth-system modeling groups.

   abstract = {Marine ecosystems are increasingly stressed by human-induced changes. Marine ecosystem drivers that contribute to stressing ecosystems - including warming, acidification, deoxygenation and perturbations to biological productivity - can co-occur in space and time, but detecting their trends is complicated by the presence of noise associated with natural variability in the climate system. Here we use large initial-condition ensemble simulations with an Earth system model under a historical/RCP8.5 (representative concentration pathway 8.5) scenario over 1950-2100 to consider emergence characteristics for the four individual and combined drivers. Using a 1-standard-deviation (67% confidence) threshold of signal to noise to define emergence with a 30-year trend window, we show that ocean acidification emerges much earlier than other drivers, namely during the 20th century over most of the global ocean. For biological productivity, the anthropogenic signal does not emerge from the noise over most of the global ocean before the end of the 21st century. The early emergence pattern for sea surface temperature in low latitudes is reversed from that of subsurface oxygen inventories, where emergence occurs earlier in the Southern Ocean. For the combined multiple-driver field, 41% of the global ocean exhibits emergence for the 2005-2014 period, and 63% for the 2075-2084 period. The combined multiple-driver field reveals emergence patterns by the end of this century that are relatively high over much of the Southern Ocean, North Pacific, and Atlantic, but relatively low over the tropics and the South Pacific. For the case of two drivers, the tropics including habitats of coral reefs emerges earliest, with this driven by the joint effects of acidification and warming. It is precisely in the regions with pronounced emergence characteristics where marine ecosystems may be expected to be pushed outside of their comfort zone determined by the degree of natural background variability to which they are adapted. The results underscore the importance of sustained multi-decadal observing systems for monitoring multiple ecosystems drivers.},

   abstract = {Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) has decreased over recent decades, with record-setting minimum events in 2007 and again in 2012. A question of interest across many disciplines concerns the extent to which such extreme events can be attributed to anthropogenic influences. First, a detection and attribution analysis is performed for trends in SIE anomalies over the observed period. The main objective of this study is an event attribution analysis for extreme minimum events in Arctic SIE. Although focus is placed on the 2012 event, the results are generalized to extreme events of other magnitudes, including both past and potential future extremes. Several ensembles of model responses are used, including two single-model large ensembles. Using several different metrics to define the events in question, it is shown that an extreme SIE minimum of the magnitude seen in 2012 is consistent with a scenario including anthropogenic influence and is extremely unlikely in a scenario excluding anthropogenic influence. Hence, the 2012 Arctic sea ice minimum provides a counterexample to the often-quoted idea that individual extreme events cannot be attributed to human influence.},

   abstract = {The role of transient Arctic sea ice loss in the projected greenhouse gas-induced late-twentieth- to late-twenty-first-century climate change is investigated using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's Coupled Model version 3. Two sets of simulations have been conducted, one with representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 radiative forcing and the second with RCP forcing but with Arctic sea ice nudged to its 1990 state. The difference between the two five-member sets indicates the influence of decreasing Arctic sea ice on the climate system. Within the Arctic, sea ice loss is found to be a primary driver of the surface temperature and precipitation changes. Arctic sea ice depletion also plays a dominant role in projected Atlantic meridional overturning circulation weakening and changes in North Atlantic extratropical sea surface temperature and salinity, especially in the first half century. The effect of present-day Arctic sea ice loss on Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropical atmospheric circulation is small relative to internal variability and the future sea ice loss effect on atmospheric circulation is distinct from the projected anthropogenic change. Arctic sea ice loss warms NH extratropical continents and is an important contributor to global warming not only over high latitudes but also in the eastern United States. Last, the Arctic sea ice loss displaces the Pacific intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) equatorward and induces a "mini-global warming" in the tropical upper troposphere.},

   abstract = {The possibility that Arctic sea ice loss weakens mid-latitude westerlies, promoting more severe cold winters, has sparked more than a decade of scientific debate, with apparent support from observations but inconclusive modelling evidence. Here we show that sixteen models contributing to the Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project simulate a weakening of mid-latitude westerlies in response to projected Arctic sea ice loss. We develop an emergent constraint based on eddy feedback, which is 1.2 to 3 times too weak in the models, suggesting that the real-world weakening lies towards the higher end of the model simulations. Still, the modelled response to Arctic sea ice loss is weak: the North Atlantic Oscillation response is similar in magnitude and offsets the projected response to increased greenhouse gases, but would only account for around 10% of variations in individual years. We further find that relationships between Arctic sea ice and atmospheric circulation have weakened recently in observations and are no longer inconsistent with those in models. The degree to which Arctic sea ice decline influences the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation is widely debated. Here, the authors use a coordinated multi-model experiment to show that Arctic sea ice loss causes a weakening of the mid-latitude westerly winds, but the effect is overall small.},

   abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently attracted great attention in geoscience due to their ability to capture non-linear system behavior and extract predictive spatiotemporal patterns. Given their black-box nature however, and the importance of prediction explainability, methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are gaining popularity as a means to explain the CNN decision-making strategy. Here, we establish an intercomparison of some of the most popular XAI methods and investigate their fidelity in explaining CNN decisions for geoscientific applications. Our goal is to raise awareness of the theoretical limitations of these methods and gain insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses to help guide best practices. The considered XAI methods are first applied to an idealized attribution benchmark, where the ground truth of explanation of the network is known a priori, to help objectively assess their performance. Secondly, we apply XAI to a climate-related prediction setting, namely to explain a CNN that is trained to predict the number of atmospheric rivers in daily snapshots of climate simulations. Our results highlight several important issues of XAI methods (e.g., gradient shattering, inability to distinguish the sign of attribution, ignorance to zero input) that have previously been overlooked in our field and, if not considered cautiously, may lead to a distorted picture of the CNN decision-making strategy. We envision that our analysis will motivate further investigation into XAI fidelity and will help towards a cautious implementation of XAI in geoscience, which can lead to further exploitation of CNNs and deep learning for prediction problems.},

   abstract = {The performance of a new historical reanalysis, the NOAA–CIRES–DOE Twentieth Century Reanalysis version 3 (20CRv3), is evaluated via comparisons with other reanalyses and independent observations. This dataset provides global, 3-hourly estimates of the atmosphere from 1806 to 2015 by assimilating only surface pressure observations and prescribing sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, and radiative forcings. Comparisons with independent observations, other reanalyses, and satellite products suggest that 20CRv3 can reliably produce atmospheric estimates on scales ranging from weather events to long-term climatic trends. Not only does 20CRv3 recreate a ‘‘best estimate’’ of the weather, including extreme events, it also provides an estimate of its confidence through the use of an ensemble. Surface pressure statistics suggest that these confidence estimates are reliable. Comparisons with independent upper-air observations in the Northern Hemisphere demonstrate that 20CRv3 has skill throughout the twentieth century. Upper-air fields from 20CRv3 in the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century correlate well with full-input reanalyses, and the correlation is predicted by the confidence fields from 20CRv3. The skill of analyzed 500-hPa geopotential heights from 20CRv3 for 1979–2015 is comparable to that of modern operational 3–4-day forecasts. Finally, 20CRv3 performs well on climate time scales. Long time series and multidecadal averages of mass, circulation, and precipitation fields agree well with modern reanalyses and station- and satellite-based products. 20CRv3 is also able to capture trends in tropospheric-layer temperatures that correlate well with independent products in the twentieth century, placing recent trends in a longer historical context.},

   abstract = {The approximately century-long instrumental record of precipitation over land reflects a single sampling of internal variability. Thus, the spatiotemporal evolution of the observations is only one realization of what could have occurred given the same climate system and boundary conditions but different initial conditions.While climate models can be used to produce initial-condition large ensembles that explicitly sample different sequences of internal variability, an analogous approach is not possible for the real world. Here, we explore the use of a statistical model for monthly precipitation to generate synthetic ensembles based on a single record. When tested within the context of the NCAR Community Earth System Model version 1 Large Ensemble (CESM1-LE), we find that the synthetic ensemble can closely reproduce the spatiotemporal statistics of variability and trends in winter precipitation over the extended contiguous United States and that it is difficult to infer the climate change signal in a single record given the magnitude of the variability.We additionally create a synthetic ensemble based on the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) dataset, termed the GPCC-synth-LE; comparison of the GPCC-synth-LE with the CESM1-based ensembles reveals differences in the spatial structures and magnitudes of variability, highlighting the advantages of an observationally based ensemble.We finally use the GPCC-synth-LE to analyze three water resource metrics in the upper Colorado River basin: frequency of dry, wet, and whiplash years. Thirty-one-year climatologies in the GPCC-synth-LE can differ by over 20% in these key water resource metrics due to sampling of internal variability, and individual ensemble members in the GPCC-synth-LE can exhibit large near-monotonic trends over the course of the last century due to sampling of internal variability alone.},

Thus, an important issue for these decision makers, and for organizations that fund climate research, is as follows: what is the scope for narrowing the uncertainty through future investments in climate science? Here, we address this question through analysis of twenty-first-century surface air temperature predictions (shown in Fig. 1) in the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP's) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) mul-timodel dataset, as used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4; Solomon et al. 2007). This analysis is subject to some caveats, which we acknowledge and discuss. FIG. I. Global mean, annual mean, surface air temperature predictions from 15 different global climate models under three different emission scenarios from 2000 to 2100 (thin lines): SRES A2 (red), AIB (green), and Bl (blue), designated as high-, medium-, and low-emissions paths, respectively. The same models forced with historical forcings are shown as the thin gray lines, and the observed global mean temperatures from 1950 to 2007 (Brohan et al. 2006) are shown as the thick black line. The multimodel mean for each emissions scenario is shown with thick colored lines demonstrating how uncertainty in future emissions gives rise to uncertainty in climate predictions. The different scenarios give nearly identical predictions until around 2025, demonstrating the delayed effect of future emissions. Each model has a different response to climate forcings, as seen by the spread in results for one particular scenario (or color). The internal (interannual) variability can be seen superimposed on the trend for any one individual prediction. All temperatures are shown as anomalies from the 1971-2000 mean.},

   abstract = {As climate change research becomes increasingly applied, the need for actionable information is growing rapidly. A key aspect of this requirement is the representation of uncertainties. The conventional approach to representing uncertainty in physical aspects of climate change is probabilistic, based on ensembles of climate model simulations. In the face of deep uncertainties, the known limitations of this approach are becoming increasingly apparent. An alternative is thus emerging which may be called a ‘storyline’ approach. We define a storyline as a physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways. No a priori probability of the storyline is assessed; emphasis is placed instead on understanding the driving factors involved, and the plausibility of those factors. We introduce a typology of four reasons for using storylines to represent uncertainty in physical aspects of climate change: (i) improving risk awareness by framing risk in an event-oriented rather than a probabilistic manner, which corresponds more directly to how people perceive and respond to risk; (ii) strengthening decision-making by allowing one to work backward from a particular vulnerability or decision point, combining climate change information with other relevant factors to address compound risk and develop appropriate stress tests; (iii) providing a physical basis for partitioning uncertainty, thereby allowing the use of more credible regional models in a conditioned manner and (iv) exploring the boundaries of plausibility, thereby guarding against false precision and surprise. Storylines also offer a powerful way of linking physical with human aspects of climate change.},

Projections of multi-model mean under four different shared socioeconomic pathways were also examined. The results reveal that the majority of models reasonably capture the dominant features of the spatial variations in observed temperature with a pattern correlation typically greater than 0.98, but with large variability across models and regions. In addition, the CMIP6 mean can capture the trends of global surface temperatures shown by the observational data during 1901–1940 (warming), 1941–1970 (cooling) and 1971–2014 (rapid warming). By the end of the 21st century, the global temperature under different scenarios is projected to increase by 1.18 ◦C/100 yr (SSP1-2.6), 3.22 ◦C/100 yr (SSP2-4.5), 5.50 ◦C/100 yr (SSP3-7.0) and 7.20 ◦C/100 yr (SSP5-8.5), with greater warming projected over the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere and weaker warming over the tropics and the southern hemisphere.

From a dataset of 88125 climate-related papers published since 2012, when this question was last addressed comprehensively, we examine a randomized subset of 3000 such publications. We also use a second sample-weighted approach that was specifically biased with keywords to help identify any sceptical peer-reviewed papers in the whole dataset. We identify four sceptical papers out of the sub-set of 3000, as evidenced by abstracts that were rated as implicitly or explicitly sceptical of human-caused global warming. In our sample utilizing pre-identified sceptical keywords we found 28 papers that were implicitly or explicitly sceptical. We conclude with high statistical confidence that the scientific consensus on human-caused contemporary climate change - expressed as a proportion of the total publications - exceeds 99% in the peer reviewed scientific literature.},

   abstract = {A stochastic model of climate variability is considered in which slow changes of climate are explained as the integral response to continuous random excitation by short period “weather” disturbances. The coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land system is divided into a rapidly varying “weather” system (essentially the atmosphere) and a slowly responding “climate” system (the ocean, cryosphere, land vegetation, etc.). In the usual Statistical Dynamical Model (SDM) only the average transport effects of the rapidly varying weather components are parameterised in the climate system. The resultant prognostic equations are deterministic, and climate variability can normally arise only through variable external conditions. The essential feature of stochastic climate models is that the non-averaged “weather” components are also retained. They appear formally as random forcing terms. The climate system, acting as an integrator of this short-period excitation, exhibits the same random-walk response characteristics as large particles interacting with an ensemble of much smaller particles in the analogous Brownian motion problem. The model predicts “red” variance spectra, in qualitative agreement with observations. The evolution of the climate probability distribution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the effect of the random weather excitation is represented by diffusion terms. Without stabilising feedback, the model predicts a continuous increase in climate variability, in analogy with the continuous, unbounded dispersion of particles in Brownian motion (or in a homogeneous turbulent fluid). Stabilising feedback yields a statistically stationary climate probability distribution. Feedback also results in a finite degree of climate predictability, but for a stationary climate the predictability is limited to maximal skill parameters of order 0.5.

   abstract = {A new ensemble of climate models is becoming available and provides the basis for climate change projections. Here, we show a first analysis indicating that the models in the new ensemble agree better with observations than those in older ones and that the poorest models have been eliminated. Most models are strongly tied to their predecessors, and some also exchange ideas and code with other models, thus supporting an earlier hypothesis that the models in the new ensemble are neither independent of each other nor independent of the earlier generation. On the basis of one atmosphere model, we show how statistical methods can identify similarities between model versions and complement process understanding in characterizing how and why a model has changed. We argue that the interdependence of models complicates the interpretation of multimodel ensembles but largely goes unnoticed. ©2013 American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

The hypothesis is investigated with a simple mathe-matical model. An equation whose dependent variables are ensemble averages of the ''error energy " in separate scales of motion is derived from the vorticity equation which governs two-dimensional incompressible flow. Solutions of the equation are determined by numerical integration, for cases where the horizontal extent and total energy of the system are comparable to those of the earth's atomsphere. It is found that each scale of motion possesses an intrinsic finite range of predictabi-lity, provided that the total energy of the system does not fall off too rapidly with decreasing wave length. With the chosen values of the constants, " cumulus-scale " motions can be predicted about one hour, " synoptic-scale " motions a few days, and the largest scales a few weeks in advance. The applicability of the model to real physical systems, including the earth's atmosphere, is considered.},

Both ensembles contain large numbers of integrations (17 and 40): each of which is subject to identical anthropogenic radiative forcing (e.g., greenhouse gas increase) but begins from a slightly different initial atmospheric state. Thus, the diversity of projected climate trends within each model ensemble is due solely to intrinsic, unpredictable variability of the climate system. Both model ensembles show that natural climate variability superimposed upon forced climate change will result in a range of possible future trends for surface air temperature and precipitation over the next 50 yr. Precipitation trends are particularly subject to uncertainty as a result of internal variability, with signal-to-noise ratios less than 2. Intrinsic atmospheric circulation variability is mainly responsible for the spread in future climate trends, imparting regional coherence to the internally driven air temperature and precipitation trends. The results underscore the importance of conducting a large number of climate change projections with a given model, as each realization will contain a different superposition of unforced and forced trends. Such initial-condition ensembles are also needed to determine the anthropogenic climate response at local and regional scales and provide a new perspective on how to usefully compare climate change projections across models. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

Accurate quantification of this uncertainty is critical for both contextualizing historical trends and determining the spread of climate projections. The contribution of internal variability to uncertainty in trends can be estimated in models as the spread across an initial condition ensemble. However, internal variability simulated by a modelmay be inconsistent with observations due tomodel biases. Here, statistical resamplingmethods are applied to observations in order to quantify uncertainty in historical 50-yr (1966-2015) winter near-surface air temperature trends over NorthAmerica related to incomplete sampling of internal variability. This estimate is compared with the simulated trend uncertainty in the NCAR CESM1 Large Ensemble (LENS). The comparison suggests that uncertainty in trends due to internal variability is largely overestimated in LENS, which has an average amplification of variability of 32% across NorthAmerica. The amplification of variability is greatest in the westernUnited States and Alaska. The observationally derived estimate of trend uncertainty is combined with the forced signal from LENS to produce an "Observational Large Ensemble" (OLENS). The members of OLENS indicate the range of observationally constrained, spatially consistent temperature trends that could have been observed over the past 50 years if a different sequence of internal variability had unfolded. The smaller trend uncertainty in OLENS suggests that is easier to detect the historical climate change signal in observations than in any given member of LENS.},

The 17-member Hadley Centre perturbed physics GCM ensemble [Quantifying Uncertainty in Model Predictions ("QUMP")] extends this capability by including data enabling dynamical downscaling of these ranges, and similar data are now being made available from the CMIP phase 5 (CMIP5) GCMs. These raise new opportunities to provide and apply high-resolution regional climate projections. This study highlights the importance of employing a well-considered sampling strategy from available ensembles to provide scientifically credible information on regional climate change while minimizing the computational complexity of ensemble downscaling. A subset of the QUMP ensemble is selected for a downscaling program in Vietnam using the Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) regional climate modeling system. Multiannual mean fields from each GCM are assessed with a focus on the Asian summer monsoon, given its importance to proposed applications of the projections. First, the study examines whether any model should be eliminated because significant deficiencies in its simulation may render its future climate projections unrealistic. No evidence is found to eliminate any of the 17 GCMs on these grounds. Second, the range of their future projections is explored and five models that best represent the full range of future climates are identified. The subset characterizes the range of both global and regional responses, and patterns of rainfall response, the wettest and driest projections for Vietnam, and different projected Asian summer monsoon changes. How these ranges of responses compare with those in the CMIP3 ensemble are also assessed, finding differences in both the signal and the spread of results in Southeast Asia. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

The uncertainty of the estimated ToE is specifically investigated by using three SMILEs to estimate the ICV. The results show that using 1921-40 as a baseline period, the annual mean precipitation ACC is expected to emerge within this century over extratropical regions as well as along the equatorial band. However, ToEs are unlikely to occur, even by the end of this century, over intratropical regions outside of the equatorial band. In contrast, annual mean temperature ACC has already emerged from the temperature ICV for most of the globe. Similar spatial patterns are observed at the seasonal scale, while a weaker ACC for boreal summer (June-August) precipitation and additional ICV for boreal winter (December-February) temperature translate to later ToEs for some regions. In addition, the uncertainty of ToE related to the choice of a SMILE is mostly less than 20 years for annual mean precipitation and temperature. However, it can be as large as 90 years for annual mean precipitation over some regions. Overall, results indicate that the choice of a SMILE is a significant source of uncertainty in the estimation of ToE and results based on only one SMILE should be interpreted with caution.},

   abstract = {The future climate projections in the IPCC reports are visually communicated via maps showing the mean response of climate models to alternative scenarios of socio-economic development. The presence of large changes is highlighted by stippling the maps where the mean climate response (the signal) is large compared to internal variability (the noise) and the response is robust, that is, consistent in sign, across the individual models. In addition, hatching is used to mark the regions with a small multi-model mean change. This approach may fail to recognize the risk of large changes in regions where the uncertainty is large and the response is not robust. Here, we present a more informative diagnostic to support risk assessment that is obtained by quantifying the mean forced signal-to-noise ratio of the individual model responses, rather than the signal-to-noise ratio of the mean response. This enables us to identify regions where a large future change compared to year-to-year variability is plausible, regardless of whether the signal is robust across the ensemble. For mean precipitation changes, we find that the majority (58% in surface area) of the unmarked regions and a sizeable portion (19%) of the hatched regions from the AR5 projections hid climate change responses to the RCP8.5 scenario that are on average large compared to the year-to-year variability. Based on the newer CMIP6 ensemble, a considerable potential for large annual-mean precipitation changes, despite the lack of a robust multi-model projection, exists over 22% of the surface land area, particularly in Central America, northern South America (including the Amazon), Central and West Africa (including parts of the Sahel), and the Maritime Continent.},

   abstract = {Model simulations of the next few decades are widely used in assessments of climate change impacts and as guidance for adaptation. Their non-linear nature reveals a level of irreducible uncertainty which it is important to understand and quantify, especially for projections of near-term regional climate. Here we use large idealised initial condition ensembles of the FAMOUS global climate model with a 1 %/year compound increase in CO 2 levels to quantify the range of future temperatures in model-based projections. These simulations explore the role of both atmospheric and oceanic initial conditions and are the largest such ensembles to date. Short-term simulated trends in global temperature are diverse, and cooling periods are more likely to be followed by larger warming rates. The spatial pattern of near-term temperature change varies considerably, but the proportion of the surface showing a warming is more consistent. In addition, ensemble spread in inter-annual temperature declines as the climate warms, especially in the North Atlantic. Over Europe, atmospheric initial condition uncertainty can, for certain ocean initial conditions, lead to 20 year trends in winter and summer in which every location can exhibit either strong cooling or rapid warming. However, the details of the distribution are highly sensitive to the ocean initial condition chosen and particularly the state of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. On longer timescales, the warming signal becomes more clear and consistent amongst different initial condition ensembles. An ensemble using a range of different oceanic initial conditions produces a larger spread in temperature trends than ensembles using a single ocean initial condition for all lead times. This highlights the potential benefits from initialising climate predictions from ocean states informed by observations. These results suggest that climate projections need to be performed with many more ensemble members than at present, using a range of ocean initial conditions, if the uncertainty in near-term regional climate is to be adequately quantified.},

This estimate is biased by systematic model errors in the forced NAO response and IV. Across the North Atlantic, the NAO explains a substantial fraction of the spread in mean sea level pressure (MSLP) projections due to IV, except in the central North Atlantic. Conversely, the spread in North Atlantic MSLP projections associated with model differences is largely unexplained by the NAO.

A regional barotropic atmospheric process over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean in summer (June–August), featuring either a year-to-year change or a low-frequency trend toward geopotential height rise, has been identified as an essential contributor to September sea ice loss, in both observations and the CESM1 Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) of simulations. This local melting is further found to be sensitive to remote sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean. Here, we utilize five available large ‘‘initial condition’’ Earth system model ensembles and 31 CMIP5 models’ preindustrial control simulations to show that the same atmospheric process, resembling the observed one and the one found in the CESM-LE, also dominates internal sea ice variability in summer on interannual to interdecadal time scales in preindustrial, historical, and future scenarios, regardless of the modeling environment. However, all models exhibit limitations in replicating the magnitude of the observed local atmosphere–sea ice coupling and its sensitivity to remote tropical SST variability in the past four decades. These biases call for caution in the interpretation of existing models’ simulations and fresh thinking about models’ credibility in simulating interactions of sea ice variability with the Arctic and global climate systems. Further efforts toward identifying the causes of these model limitations may provide implications for alleviating the biases and improving interannual- and decadal-time-scale sea ice prediction and future sea ice projection.},

While classifying El Niño and La Niña is relatively straightforward, El Niño events can be broadly classified into two types: Central Pacific (CP) and Eastern Pacific (EP). Differentiating between CP and EP events is currently dependent on both the method and observational dataset used. In this study, we create a new classification scheme using supervised machine learning trained 5 on 18 observational and reanalysis products. This builds on previous work by identifying classes of events using the temporal evolution of sea surface temperature in multiple regions across the tropical Pacific. By applying this new classifier to seven single model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs) we investigate both the internal variability and forced changes in each type of ENSO event, where events identified behave similar to those observed. It is currently debated whether the observed increase in the frequency of CP events after the late 1970s is due to climate change. We found it to be within the range of 10 internal variability in the SMILEs. When considering future changes, we do not project a change in CP frequency or amplitude under a strong warming scenario (RCP8.5/SSP370) and we find model differences in EP El Niño and La Niña frequency and amplitude projections. Finally, we find that models show differences in projected precipitation and SST pattern changes for each event type that do not seem to be linked to the Pacific mean state SST change, although the SST and precipitation changes in individual SMILEs are linked. Our work demonstrates the value of combining machine learning with climate models, and 15 highlights the need to use SMILEs when evaluating ENSO in climate models due to the large spread of results found within a single model due to internal variability alone.},

   abstract = {The objective of this research is to develop techniques for assimilating GOES-R series observations in precipitating scenes for the purpose of improving short-term convective-scale forecasts of high-impact weather hazards. Whereas one approach is radiance assimilation, the information content of GOES-R radiances from its Advanced Baseline Imager saturates in precipitating scenes, and radiance assimilation does not make use of lightning observations from the GOES Lightning Mapper. Here, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is developed to transform GOES-R radiances and lightning into synthetic radar reflectivity fields to make use of existing radar assimilation techniques. We find that the ability of CNNs to utilize spatial context is essential for this application and offers breakthrough improvement in skill compared to traditional pixel-by-pixel based approaches. To understand the improved performance, we use a novel analysis method that combines several techniques, each providing different insights into the network’s reasoning. Channel-withholding experiments and spatial information–withholding experiments are used to show that the CNN achieves skill at high reflectivity values from the information content in radiance gradients and the presence of lightning. The attribution method, layerwise relevance propagation, demonstrates that the CNN uses radiance and lightning information synergistically, where lightning helps the CNN focus on which neighboring locations are most important. Synthetic inputs are used to quantify the sensitivity to radiance gradients, showing that sharper gradients produce a stronger response in predicted reflectivity. Lightning observations are found to be uniquely valuable for their ability to pinpoint locations of strong radar echoes.},

Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is a technique that brings such explainability and scales to potentially highly complex deep neural networks. It operates by propagating the prediction backward in the neural network, using a set of purposely designed propagation rules. In this chapter, we give a concise introduction to LRP with a discussion of (1) how to implement propagation rules easily and efficiently, (2) how the propagation procedure can be theoretically justified as a ‘deep Taylor decomposition’, (3) how to choose the propagation rules at each layer to deliver high explanation quality, and (4) how LRP can be extended to handle a variety of machine learning scenarios beyond deep neural networks.},

   abstract = {The development of “intelligent” systems that can take decisions and perform autonomously might lead to faster and more consistent decisions. A limiting factor for a broader adoption of AI technology is the inherent risks that come with giving up human control and oversight to “intelligent” machines. Forsensitive tasks involving critical infrastructures and affecting human well-being or health, it is crucial to limit the possibility of improper, non-robust and unsafe decisions and actions. Before deploying an AI system, we see a strong need to validate its behavior, and thus establish guarantees that it will continue toperform as expected when deployed in a real-world environment. In pursuit of that objective, ways for humans to verify the agreement between the AI decision structure and their own ground-truth knowledge have been explored. Explainable AI (XAI) has developed as a subfield of AI, focused on exposing complex AI models to humans in a systematic and interpretable manner. The 22 chapters included in this book provide a timely snapshot of algorithms, theory, and applications ofinterpretable and explainable AI and AI techniques that have been proposed recently reflecting the current discourse in this field and providing directions of future development. The book is organized in six parts: towards AI transparency; methods for interpreting AI systems; explaining the decisions of AI systems;evaluating interpretability and explanations; applications of explainable AI; and software for explainable AI.},

   abstract = {The Arctic has experienced a warming rate higher than the global mean in the past decades, but previous studies show that there are large uncertainties associated with future Arctic temperature projections. In this study, nearsurface mean temperatures in the Arctic are analyzed from 22 models participating in phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Compared with the ERA5 reanalysis, most CMIP6 models underestimate the observed mean temperature in the Arctic during 1979-2014. The largest cold biases are found over the Greenland Sea the Barents Sea, and the Kara Sea. Under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, the multimodel ensemble mean of 22 CMIP6 models exhibits significant Arctic warming in the future and the warming rate is more than twice that of the global/Northern Hemisphere mean. Model spread is the largest contributor to the overall uncertainty in projections, which accounts for 55.4% of the total uncertainty at the start of projections in 2015 and remains at 32.9% at the end of projections in 2095. Internal variability uncertainty accounts for 39.3% of the total uncertainty at the start of projections but decreases to 6.5% at the end of the twenty-first century, while scenario uncertainty rapidly increases from 5.3% to 60.7% over the period from 2015 to 2095. It is found that the largest model uncertainties are consistent cold bias in the oceanic regions in the models, which is connected with excessive sea ice area caused by the weak Atlantic poleward heat transport. These results suggest that large intermodel spread and uncertainties exist in the CMIP6 models' simulation and projection of the Arctic nearsurface temperature and that there are different responses over the ocean and land in the Arctic to greenhouse gas forcing. Future research needs to pay more attention to the different characteristics and mechanisms of Arctic Ocean and land warming to reduce the spread.},

   abstract = {Under rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, the Arctic exhibits amplified warming relative to the globe. This Arctic amplification is a defining feature of global warming. However, the Arctic is also home to large internal variability, which can make the detection of a forced climate response difficult. Here we use results from seven model large ensembles, which have different rates of Arctic warming and sea ice loss, to assess the time of emergence of anthropogenically-forced Arctic amplification. We find that this time of emergence occurs at the turn of the century in all models, ranging across the models by a decade from 1994–2005. We also assess transient changes in this amplified signal across the 21st century and beyond. Over the 21st century, the projections indicate that the maximum Arctic warming will transition from fall to winter due to sea ice reductions that extend further into the fall. Additionally, the magnitude of the annual amplification signal declines over the 21st century associated in part with a weakening albedo feedback strength. In a simulation that extends to the 23rd century, we find that as sea ice cover is completely lost, there is little further reduction in the surface albedo and Arctic amplification saturates at a level that is reduced from its 21st century value.},

Based on surface energy budget analysis, we show that the largest contribution (∼82%) to this cold season warming trend is attributed to changes in clear-sky downward longwave radiation. In contrast to that in Arctic summer and over tropics, a reduction in lower-tropospheric inversions plays a unique role in explaining the reduction of the downward longwave radiation associated with atmospheric nonuniform temperature and corresponding moisture changes. Our analyses also suggest that Arctic lower-tropospheric stability should be considered in conjunction with sea-ice decline during the preceding warm season to explain AA.},

The principal purpose of this assessment is to provide an overview of the ability of the CMIP6 ensemble to represent the Arctic climate, and to see how this has changed since the last phase of CMIP. Overall, we find a distinct improvement in the representation of the sea ice volume and extent, the latter mostly linked to improvements in the seasonal cycle in the Barents Sea. However, numerous model biases have persisted into CMIP6 including too-cold conditions in the winter (4-K cold bias) and a negative trend in the day-to-day variability over ice in winter. We find that under the low-emission scenario, SSP126, the Arctic climate is projected to stabilize by 2060 with an annual mean sea ice extent of around 2.5 million km2 and an annual mean temperature 4.7 K warmer than the early-twentieth-century average, compared to 1.7 K of warming globally.},

   abstract = {Abstract. Thermodynamic profiles are affected by both the large-scale dynamics and the local processes, such as radiation, cloud formation and turbulence. Based on ERA5 reanalysis, radiosoundings and cloud cover observations from winters 2009–2018, this study demonstrates manifold impacts of large-scale circulation on temperature and specific humidity profiles in the circumpolar Arctic north of 65∘ N. Characteristic wintertime circulation types are allocated using self-organizing maps (SOMs). The study shows that influence of different large-scale flows must be viewed as a progressing set of processes: (1) horizontal advection of heat and moisture, driven by circulation, lead to so-called first-order effects on thermodynamic profiles and turbulent surface fluxes, and (2) the advection is followed by transformation of the air through various physical processes, causing second-order effects. An example of second-order effects is the associated cloud formation, which shifts the strongest radiative cooling from the surface to the cloud top. The temperature and specific humidity profiles are most sensitive to large-scale circulation over the Eurasian land west of 90∘ E and the Arctic Ocean sea ice, whereas impacts over North America and Greenland are more ambiguous. Eurasian land, between 90 and 140∘ E, occasionally receives warm and moist air from the northern North Atlantic, which, with the support of radiative impacts of clouds, weakens the otherwise strong temperature and specific humidity inversions. Altitudes of maximum temperature and specific humidity in a profile and their variability between the circulation types are good indicators of the depth of the layer impacted by surface–atmosphere processes interacting with the large-scale circulation. Different circulation types typically cause variations of a few hundred metres to this altitude, and the layer impacted is deepest over north-eastern Eurasia and North America.},

The utility of reanalysis datasets based on data assimilation is affected by their accuracy and biases. Therefore, it is important to evaluate their performance. Here, we conduct inter-comparisons of two temperature variables, namely, the 2-m air temperature (Ta) and the surface temperature (Ts), from the widely used ERA-I and ERA5 reanalysis datasets provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) against in situ observations from three international buoy programs (i.e., the International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP), the Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC), and the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL)) during 2010–2020 in the Arctic. Overall, the results show that both the ERA-I and ERA5 were well correlated with the buoy observations, with the highest correlation coefficient reaching 0.98. There were generally warm Ta biases for both ERA-I (2.27 ± 3.33◦C) and ERA5 (2.34 ± 3.22◦C) when compared with more than 3000 matching pairs of daily buoy observations. The warm Ta biases of both reanalysis datasets exhibited seasonal variations, reaching the maximum of 3.73 ± 2.84◦C in April and the minimum of 1.36 ± 2.51◦C in September. For Ts, both ERA-I and ERA5 exhibited good consistencies with the buoy observations, but have higher amplitude biases compared with those for Ta, with generally negative biases of −4.79 ± 4.86◦C for ERA-I and −4.11 ± 3.92◦C for ERA5. For both reanalysis datasets, the largest bias of Ts (−11.18 ± 3.08◦C) occurred in December, while the biases were rather small (less than −3◦C) in the warmer months (April to October). The cold Ts biases for ERA-I and ERA5 were probably overestimated due to the location of the surface temperature sensors on the buoys, which may have been affected by snow cover. Both the Ta and Ts biases varied for different buoy programs and different sea ice concentration conditions, yet they exhibited similar trends.},

The reanalyses are evaluated using observations fromtheNorwegian Young Sea Ice campaign (N-ICE2015), a 5-month ice drift in pack ice north of Svalbard. N-ICE2015 observations include surface meteorology, vertical profiles from radiosondes, as well as radiative and turbulent heat fluxes. The reanalyses simulate surface analysis variables well throughout the campaign, but have difficulties with most forecast variables. Wintertime (January-March) correlation coefficients between the reanalyses and observations are above 0.90 for the surface pressure, 2-m temperature, total column water vapor, and downward longwave flux. However, all reanalyses have a positivewintertime 2-m temperature bias, ranging from 1° to 4°C, and negative (i.e., upward) net longwave bias of 3-19Wm-2. These biases are associated with poorly represented surface inversions and are largest during cold-stable periods. Notably, the recent ERA5 and ASRv2 datasets have some of the largest temperature and net longwave biases, respectively. During spring (April-May), reanalyses fail to simulate observed persistent cloud layers. Therefore they overestimate the net shortwave flux (5-79Wm-2) and underestimate the net longwave flux (8-38Wm-2). Promisingly, ERA5 provides the best estimates of downward radiative fluxes in spring and summer, suggesting improved forecasting of Arctic cloud cover. All reanalyses exhibit large negative (upward) residual heat flux biases during winter, and positive (downward) biases during summer. Turbulent heat fluxes over sea ice are simulated poorly in all seasons.},

Anthropogenic warming threatens to release an unknown quantity of this carbon to the atmosphere, influencing the climate in processes collectively known as the permafrost carbon feedback. In this Review, we discuss advances in tracking permafrost carbon dynamics, including mechanisms of abrupt thaw, instrumental observations of carbon release and model predictions of the permafrost carbon feedback. Abrupt thaw and thermokarst could emit a substantial amount of carbon to the atmosphere rapidly (days to years), mobilizing the deep legacy carbon sequestered in Yedoma. Carbon dioxide emissions are proportionally larger than other greenhouse gas emissions in the Arctic, but expansion of anoxic conditions within thawed permafrost and soils stands to increase the proportion of future methane emissions. Increasingly frequent wildfires in the Arctic will also lead to a notable but unpredictable carbon flux. More detailed monitoring though in situ, airborne and satellite observations will provide a deeper understanding of the Arctic’s future role as a carbon source or sink, and the subsequent impact on the Earth system. Large stores of carbon could be released to the atmosphere from Arctic warming, driving permafrost thaw. This Review examines the processes that impact Arctic permafrost carbon emissions, how they might change in the future and ways to monitor and predict these changes.},

   abstract = {The multi-channel satellite passive-microwave record of Earth's sea ice coverage, extending back to the late 1970s, has long revealed declining sea ice coverage in the Arctic but through 2015 revealed an overall increase rather than decrease in Antarctic sea ice coverage. Following major decreases in Antarctic sea ice since 2015, the 42-year 1979–2020 satellite dataset now shows recent losses in sea ice coverage in both hemispheres, and this is convincingly demonstrated by the enumeration of monthly and yearly record high and record low sea ice extents experienced over the course of the 42 years. In fact, one of the most convincing statistics on the declining Arctic sea ice cover is the fact that since 1986 the Arctic has not experienced a single monthly record high sea ice extent in any month but has experienced 93 monthly record lows. In contrast, all 12 calendar months have their 42-year Antarctic monthly record high sea ice extents in the period 2007–2015, while 8 of the 12 calendar months have had Antarctic record lows since 2015. Globally, every calendar month has registered a new monthly record low within the past 5 years. These results are complemented (and somewhat tempered) by quantification of the range of monthly and yearly sea ice extent values over the 42 years. For instance, although the Arctic's lowest September monthly average sea ice extent (in 2012) is 53% lower than its highest September monthly average sea ice extent (in 1980), the other months have far smaller percent differences between their lowest and highest Arctic values. For yearly average sea ice extents, the Arctic's lowest value (in 2020) is 18% lower than its highest value (in 1982), the Antarctic's lowest value (in 2017) is 16% lower than its highest value (in 2014), and the global lowest value (in 2019) is only 12% lower than its highest value (in 1982).},

   abstract = {The Arctic climate system is rapidly transitioning into a new regime with a reduction in the extent of sea ice, enhanced mixing in the ocean and atmosphere, and thus enhanced coupling within the ocean-ice-atmosphere system; these physical changes are leading to ecosystem changes in the Arctic Ocean. In this review paper, we assess one of the critically important aspects of this new regime, the variability of Arctic freshwater, which plays a fundamental role in the Arctic climate system by impacting ocean stratification and sea ice formation or melt. Liquid and solid freshwater exports also affect the global climate system, notably by impacting the global ocean overturning circulation. We assess how freshwater budgets have changed relative to the 2000-2010 period. We include discussions of processes such as poleward atmospheric moisture transport, runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet and Arctic glaciers, the role of snow on sea ice, and vertical redistribution. Notably, sea ice cover has become more seasonal and more mobile; the mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet increased in the 2010s (particularly in the western, northern, and southern regions) and imported warm, salty Atlantic waters have shoaled. During 2000-2010, the Arctic Oscillation and moisture transport into the Arctic are in-phase and have a positive trend. This cyclonic atmospheric circulation pattern forces reduced freshwater content on the Atlantic-Eurasian side of the Arctic Ocean and freshwater gains in the Beaufort Gyre. We show that the trend in Arctic freshwater content in the 2010s has stabilized relative to the 2000s, potentially due to an increased compensation between a freshening of the Beaufort Gyre and a reduction in freshwater in the rest of the Arctic Ocean. However, large inter-model spread across the ocean reanalyses and uncertainty in the observations used in this study prevent a definitive conclusion about the degree of this compensation.},

Here, we use seven years of CryoSat-2 swath interferometric altimetry to track changes in the volume of Arctic GIC. From these data, we produce a pan-Arctic assessment of GIC mass imbalance, and we partition their losses into signals associated with atmospheric processes and glacier dynamics. Between 2010 and 2017, Arctic GIC lost 609 ± 7 Gt of ice, contributing 0.240 ± 0.007 mm per year to global sea level rise. While surface ablation is responsible for 87% of losses across the Arctic, dynamic imbalance is increasing in the Barents and Kara Sea region where it now accounts for 43% of total ice loss. Arctic GIC's dynamic imbalance is associated with a northward shift of Atlantic climate, and this effect should be considered in global sea level projections.},

   abstract = {We reconstruct the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet using a comprehensive survey of thickness, surface elevation, velocity, and surface mass balance (SMB) of 260 glaciers from 1972 to 2018. We calculate mass discharge, D, into the ocean directly for 107 glaciers (85% of D) and indirectly for 110 glaciers (15%) using velocity-scaled reference fluxes. The decadal mass balance switched from a mass gain of +47 ± 21 Gt/y in 1972–1980 to a loss of 51 ± 17 Gt/y in 1980–1990. The mass loss increased from 41 ± 17 Gt/y in 1990–2000, to 187 ± 17 Gt/y in 2000–2010, to 286 ± 20 Gt/y in 2010–2018, or sixfold since the 1980s, or 80 ± 6 Gt/y per decade, on average. The acceleration in mass loss switched from positive in 2000–2010 to negative in 2010–2018 due to a series of cold summers, which illustrates the difficulty of extrapolating short records into longer-term trends. Cumulated since 1972, the largest contributions to global sea level rise are from northwest (4.4 ± 0.2 mm), southeast (3.0 ± 0.3 mm), and central west (2.0 ± 0.2 mm) Greenland, with a total 13.7 ± 1.1 mm for the ice sheet. The mass loss is controlled at 66 ± 8% by glacier dynamics (9.1 mm) and 34 ± 8% by SMB (4.6 mm). Even in years of high SMB, enhanced glacier discharge has remained sufficiently high above equilibrium to maintain an annual mass loss every year since 1998.},

   abstract = {Arctic amplification (AA) is a coupled atmosphere-sea ice-ocean process. This understanding has evolved from the early concept of AA, as a consequence of snow-ice line progressions, through more than a century of research that has clarified the relevant processes and driving mechanisms of AA. The predictions made by early modeling studies, namely the fall/winter maximum, bottom-heavy structure, the prominence of surface albedo feedback, and the importance of stable stratification have withstood the scrutiny of multi-decadal observations and more complex models. Yet, the uncertainty in Arctic climate projections is larger than in any other region of the planet, making the assessment of high-impact, near-term regional changes difficult or impossible. Reducing this large spread in Arctic climate projections requires a quantitative process understanding. This manuscript aims to build such an understanding by synthesizing current knowledge of AA and to produce a set of recommendations to guide future research. It briefly reviews the history of AA science, summarizes observed Arctic changes, discusses modeling approaches and feedback diagnostics, and assesses the current understanding of the most relevant feedbacks to AA. These sections culminate in a conceptual model of the fundamental physical mechanisms causing AA and a collection of recommendations to accelerate progress towards reduced uncertainty in Arctic climate projections. Our conceptual model highlights the need to account for local feedback and remote process interactions within the context of the annual cycle to constrain projected AA. We recommend raising the priority of Arctic climate sensitivity research, improving the accuracy of Arctic surface energy budget observations, rethinking climate feedback definitions, coordinating new model experiments and intercomparisons, and further investigating the role of episodic variability in AA.},

In this review, we synthesize current understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that can give rise to AA. These mechanisms include both local feedbacks and changes in poleward energy transport. Temperature and sea ice-related feedbacks are especially important for AA, since they are significantly more positive over the Arctic than at lower latitudes. Changes in energy transport by the atmosphere and ocean can also contribute to AA. These energy transport changes are tightly coupled with local feedbacks, and thus their respective contributions to AA should not be considered in isolation. It is here emphasized that the feedbacks and energy transport changes that give rise to AA are sensitively dependent on the state of the climate system itself. This implies that changes in the climate state will lead to changes in the strength of AA, with implications for past and future climate change.},

   abstract = {The precise mechanisms driving Arctic amplification are still under debate. Previous attribution methods compute the vertically uniform temperature change required to balance the top-of-atmosphere energy imbalance caused by each forcing and feedback, with any departures from vertically uniform warming collected into the lapse-rate feedback. We propose an alternative attribution method using a single-column model that accounts for the forcing dependence of high-latitude lapse-rate changes. We examine this method in an idealized general circulation model (GCM), finding that, even though the column-integrated carbon dioxide (CO2) forcing and water vapor feedback are stronger in the tropics, they contribute to polar-amplified surface warming as they produce bottom-heavy warming in high latitudes. A separation of atmospheric temperature changes into local and remote contributors shows that, in the absence of polar surface forcing (e.g., sea ice retreat), changes in energy transport are primarily responsible for the polar-amplified pattern of warming. The addition of surface forcing substantially increases polar surface warming and reduces the contribution of atmospheric dry static energy transport to the warming. This physically based attribution method can be applied to comprehensive GCMs to provide a clearer view of the mechanisms behind Arctic amplification.},

   abstract = {Arctic surface warming under greenhouse gas forcing peaks in winter and reaches its minimum during summer in both observations and model projections. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this seasonal asymmetry, but disentangling these processes remains a challenge in the interpretation of general circulation model (GCM) experiments. To isolate these mechanisms, we use an idealized single-column sea ice model (SCM) that captures the seasonal pattern of Arctic warming. SCM experiments demonstrate that as sea ice melts and exposes open ocean, the accompanying increase in effective surface heat capacity alone can produce the observed pattern of peak warming in early winter (shifting to late winter under increased forcing) by slowing the seasonal heating rate, thus delaying the phase and reducing the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of surface temperature. To investigate warming seasonality in more complex models, we perform GCM experiments that individually isolate sea ice albedo and thermodynamic effects under CO2 forcing. These also show a key role for the effective heat capacity of sea ice in promoting seasonal asymmetry through suppressing summer warming, in addition to precluding summer climatological inversions and a positive summer lapse-rate feedback. Peak winter warming in GCM experiments is further supported by a positive winter lapse-rate feedback, due to cold initial surface temperatures and strong surface-trapped warming that are enabled by the albedo effects of sea ice alone. While many factors contribute to the seasonal pattern of Arctic warming, these results highlight changes in effective surface heat capacity as a central mechanism supporting this seasonality. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Under increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the strongest Arctic warming has occurred during early winter, but the reasons for this seasonal pattern of warming are not well understood. We use experiments in both simple and complex models with certain sea ice processes turned on and off to disentangle potential drivers of seasonality in Arctic warming. When sea ice melts and open ocean is exposed, surface temperatures are slower to reach the warm-season maximum and slower to cool back down below freezing in early winter. We find that this process alone can produce the observed pattern of maximum Arctic warming in early winter, highlighting a fundamental mechanism for the seasonality of Arctic warming.},

   abstract = {When simulating past warm climates, such as the early Cretaceous and Paleogene periods, general circulation models (GCMs) underestimate the magnitude of warming in the Arctic. Additionally, model intercomparisons show a large spread in the magnitude of Arctic warming for these warmer-than-modern climates. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these disagreements, including the unrealistic representation of polar clouds or underestimated poleward heat transport in the models. This study provides an intercomparison of Arctic cloud and atmospheric heat transport (AHT) responses to strong imposed polar-amplified surface ocean warming across four atmosphere-only GCMs. All models simulate an increase in high clouds throughout the year; the resulting reduction in longwave radiation loss to space acts to support the imposed Arctic warming. The response of low- and midlevel clouds varies considerably across the models, with models responding differently to surface warming and sea ice removal. The AHT is consistently weaker in the imposed warming experiments due to a large reduction in dry static energy transport that offsets a smaller increase in latent heat transport, thereby opposing the imposed surface warming. Our idealized polar amplification experiments require very large increases in implied ocean heat transport (OHT) to maintain steady state. Increased CO2 or tropical temperatures that likely characterized past warm climates reduce the need for such large OHT increases.},

Further we show the rate of occurrence of such an extreme heat event is likely to substantially increase in the future with increasing levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases. While uncertainty in projected climate risk from model choice leads to a broad range of future extreme heat event probabilities, some models project that with rapidly increasing levels of greenhouse gases the likelihood of such events would exceed 75% by 2090.},

Results show greater thinning of multiyear ice with an end-of-season thickness in 2021 that is lower by ∼16.1% (0.50m), with negligible changes over first-year ice. For the period, sea ice thickness estimates using snow depth from climatology result in thicker ice (by up to ∼0.22m) with a smaller decrease in multiyear ice thickness (∼0.38m).

   abstract = {Objective measures of climate model performance are proposed and used to assess simulations of the 20th century, which are available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) archive. The primary focus of this analysis is on the climatology of atmospheric fields. For each variable considered, the models are ranked according to a measure of relative error. Based on an average of the relative errors over all fields considered, some models appear to perform substantially better than others. Forming a single index of model performance, however, can be misleading in that it hides a more complex picture of the relative merits of different models. This is demonstrated by examining individual variables and showing that the relative ranking of models varies considerably from one variable to the next. A remarkable exception to this finding is that the so-called "mean model" consistently outperforms all other models in nearly every respect. The usefulness, limitations and robustness of the metrics defined here are evaluated 1) by examining whether the information provided by each metric is correlated in any way with the others, and 2) by determining how sensitive the metrics are to such factors as observational uncertainty, spatial scale, and the domain considered (e.g., tropics versus extra-tropics). An index that gauges the fidelity of model variability on interannual time-scales is found to be only weakly correlated with an index of the mean climate performance. This illustrates the importance of evaluating a broad spectrum of climate processes and phenomena since accurate simulation of one aspect of climate does not guarantee accurate representation of other aspects. Once a broad suite of metrics has been developed to characterize model performance it may become possible to identify optimal subsets for various applications.

   abstract = {Earth system models are complex and represent a large number of processes, resulting in a persistent spread across climate projections for a given future scenario. Owing to different model performances against observations and the lack of independence among models, there is now evidence that giving equal weight to each available model projection is suboptimal. This Perspective discusses newly developed tools that facilitate a more rapid and comprehensive evaluation of model simulations with observations, process-based emergent constraints that are a promising way to focus evaluation on the observations most relevant to climate projections, and advanced methods for model weighting. These approaches are needed to distil the most credible information on regional climate changes, impacts, and risks for stakeholders and policy-makers. Earth system models project likely future climates, however, evaluation of their output is challenging. This Perspective discusses new evaluation approaches, considering both simulations and observations, to ensure credible information for decision-making.},

   abstract = {Global climate models are central tools for understanding past and future climate change. The assessment of model skill, in turn, can benefit from modern data science approaches. Here we apply causal discovery algorithms to sea level pressure data from a large set of climate model simulations and, as a proxy for observations, meteorological reanalyses. We demonstrate how the resulting causal networks (fingerprints) offer an objective pathway for process-oriented model evaluation. Models with fingerprints closer to observations better reproduce important precipitation patterns over highly populated areas such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, East Asia, Europe and North America. We further identify expected model interdependencies due to shared development backgrounds. Finally, our network metrics provide stronger relationships for constraining precipitation projections under climate change as compared to traditional evaluation metrics for storm tracks or precipitation itself. Such emergent relationships highlight the potential of causal networks to constrain longstanding uncertainties in climate change projections. Algorithms to assess causal relationships in data sets have seen increasing applications in climate science in recent years. Here, the authors show that these techniques can help to systematically evaluate the performance of climate models and, as a result, to constrain uncertainties in future climate change projections.},

   abstract = {Multi-model ensembles can be used to estimate uncertainty in projections of regional climate, but this uncertainty often depends on the constituents of the ensemble. The dependence of uncertainty on ensemble composition is clear when single-model initial condition large ensembles (SMILEs) are included within a multi-model ensemble. SMILEs allow for the quantification of internal variability, a non-negligible component of uncertainty on regional scales, but may also serve to inappropriately narrow uncertainty by giving a single model many additional votes. In advance of the mixed multi-model, the SMILE Coupled Model Intercomparison version 6 (CMIP6) ensemble, we investigate weighting approaches to incorporate 50 members of the Community Earth System Model (CESM1.2.2-LE), 50 members of the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2-LE), and 100 members of the MPI Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) into an 88-member Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble. The weights assigned are based on ability to reproduce observed climate (performance) and scaled by a measure of redundancy (dependence). Surface air temperature (SAT) and sea level pressure (SLP) predictors are used to determine the weights, and relationships between present and future predictor behavior are discussed. The estimated residual thermodynamic trend is proposed as an alternative predictor to replace 50-year regional SAT trends, which are more susceptible to internal variability. Uncertainty in estimates of northern European winter and Mediterranean summer end-of-century warming is assessed in a CMIP5 and a combined SMILE-CMIP5 multi-model ensemble. Five different weighting strategies to account for the mix of initial condition (IC) ensemble members and individually represented models within the multi-model ensemble are considered. Allowing all multi-model ensemble members to receive either equal weight or solely a performance weight (based on the root mean square error (RMSE) between members and observations over nine predictors) is shown to lead to uncertainty estimates that are dominated by the presence of SMILEs. A more suitable approach includes a dependence assumption, scaling either by 1=N, the number of constituents representing a "model", or by the same RMSE distance metric used to define model performance. SMILE contributions to the weighted ensemble are smallest (< 10 %) when a model is defined as an IC ensemble and increase slightly (< 20 %) when the definition of a model expands to include members from the same institution and/or development stream. SMILE contributions increase further when dependence is defined by RMSE (over nine predictors) amongst members because RMSEs between SMILE members can be as large as RMSEs between SMILE members and other models. We find that an alternative RMSE distance metric, derived from global SAT and hemispheric SLP climatology, is able to better identify IC members in general and SMILE members in particular as members of the same model. Further, more subtle dependencies associated with resolution differences and component similarities are also identified by the global predictor set.},

   abstract = {The sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) constitutes the latest update on expected future climate change based on a new generation of climate models. To extract reliable estimates of future warming and related uncertainties from these models, the spread in their projections is often translated into probabilistic estimates such as the mean and likely range. Here, we use a model weighting approach, which accounts for the models' historical performance based on several diagnostics as well as model interdependence within the CMIP6 ensemble, to calculate constrained distributions of global mean temperature change. We investigate the skill of our approach in a perfect model test, where we use previous-generation CMIP5 models as pseudo-observations in the historical period. The performance of the distribution weighted in the abovementioned manner with respect to matching the pseudo-observations in the future is then evaluated, and we find a mean increase in skill of about 17% compared with the unweighted distribution. In addition, we show that our independence metric correctly clusters models known to be similar based on a CMIP6 "family tree", which enables the application of a weighting based on the degree of inter-model dependence. We then apply the weighting approach, based on two observational estimates (the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Retrospective Analysis-ERA5, and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2-MERRA-2), to constrain CMIP6 projections under weak (SSP1-2.6) and strong (SSP5-8.5) climate change scenarios (SSP refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). Our results show a reduction in the projected mean warming for both scenarios because some CMIP6 models with high future warming receive systematically lower performance weights. The mean of end-of-century warming (2081-2100 relative to 1995-2014) for SSP5-8.5 with weighting is 3.7g C, compared with 4.1gC without weighting; the likely (66%) uncertainty range is 3.1 to 4.6gC, which equates to a 13% decrease in spread. For SSP1-2.6, the weighted end-of-century warming is 1gC (0.7 to 1.4gC), which results in a reduction of-0.1 gC in the mean and-24 % in the likely range compared with the unweighted case.},

   abstract = {Both the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) are regularly employed in model evaluation studies. Willmott and Matsuura (2005) have suggested that the RMSE is not a good indicator of average model performance and might be a misleading indicator of average error, and thus the MAE would be a better metric for that purpose. While some concerns over using RMSE raised by Willmott and Matsuura (2005) and Willmott et al. (2009) are valid, the proposed avoidance of RMSE in favor of MAE is not the solution. Citing the aforementioned papers, many researchers chose MAE over RMSE to present their model evaluation statistics when presenting or adding the RMSE measures could be more beneficial. In this technical note, we demonstrate that the RMSE is not ambiguous in its meaning, contrary to what was claimed by Willmott et al. (2009). The RMSE is more appropriate to represent model performance than the MAE when the error distribution is expected to be Gaussian. In addition, we show that the RMSE satisfies the triangle inequality requirement for a distance metric, whereas Willmott et al. (2009) indicated that the sums-of-squares-based statistics do not satisfy this rule. In the end, we discussed some circumstances where using the RMSE will be more beneficial. However, we do not contend that the RMSE is superior over the MAE. Instead, a combination of metrics, including but certainly not limited to RMSEs and MAEs, are often required to assess model performance. © Author(s) 2014. CC Attribution 3.0 License.},

   abstract = {Studies of emergent constraints have frequently proposed that a single metric can constrain future responses of the Earth system to anthropogenic emissions. Here, we illustrate that strong relationships between observables and future climate across an ensemble can arise from common structural model assumptions with few degrees of freedom. Such cases have the potential to produce strong yet overconfident constraints when processes are represented in a common, oversimplified fashion throughout the ensemble. We consider these issues in the context of a collection of published constraints and argue that although emergent constraints are potentially powerful tools for understanding ensemble response variation and relevant observables, their naïve application to reduce uncertainties in unknown climate responses could lead to bias and overconfidence in constrained projections. The prevalence of this thinking has led to literature in which statements are made on the probability bounds of key climate variables that were confident yet inconsistent between studies. Together with statistical robustness and a mechanism, assessments of climate responses must include multiple lines of evidence to identify biases that can arise from shared, oversimplified modelling assumptions that impact both present and future climate simulations in order to mitigate against the influence of shared structural biases.},

On the other hand, operational regional summer sea ice forecasts in a large number of coupled climate models show a considerable drop in predictive skill for forecasts initialised prior to the date of melt onset in spring, suggesting that some drivers of sea ice variability on longer time scales may not be well represented in these models. To this end, we introduce an unsupervised learning approach based on cluster analysis 5 and complex networks to establish how well the latest generation of coupled climate models participating in phase 6 of the World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) are able to reflect the spatio-temporal patterns of variability in northern-hemisphere winter sea-level pressure and Arctic summer sea ice concentration over the period 1979-2020, relative to ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis and satellite-derived sea ice observations respectively. Two specific global metrics are introduced as ways to compare patterns of variability between models and observations/reanalysis: the Adjusted 10 Rand Index-a method for comparing spatial patterns of variability, and a network distance metric-a method for comparing the degree of connectivity between two geographic regions. We find that CMIP6 models generally reflect the spatial pattern of variability of the AO relatively well, although overestimate the magnitude of sea-level pressure variability over the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and underestimate the variability over the north Africa and southern Europe. They also underestimate the importance of regions such as the Beaufort, East Siberian and Laptev seas in explaining pan-Arctic summer sea ice area 15 variability, which we hypothesise is due to regional biases in sea ice thickness. Finally, observations show that historically, winter AO events (negatively) covary strongly with summer sea ice concentration in the eastern Pacific sector of the Arctic, although now under a thinning ice regime, both the eastern and western Pacific sectors exhibit similar behaviour. CMIP6 models however do not show this transition on average, which may hinder their ability to make skilful seasonal to inter-annual predictions of summer sea ice. 20 1 https://doi.},

However, because of the inherent complexities of such data, which are often spatio-temporal, chaotic, and non-stationary, the CNN algorithms must be designed/evaluated for each specific dataset and application. Yet CNN, being a supervised technique, requires a large labeled dataset to start. Labeling demands (human) expert time which, combined with the limited number of relevant examples in this area, can discourage using CNNs for new problems. To address these challenges, here we (1) Propose an effective auto-labeling strategy based on using an unsupervised clustering algorithm and evaluating the performance of CNNs in re-identifying and predicting these clusters up to 5 days ahead of time; (2) Use this approach to label thousands of daily large-scale weather patterns over North America in the outputs of a fully-coupled climate model and show the capabilities of CNNs in re-identifying and predicting the 4 clustered regimes up to 5 days ahead of time. The deep CNN trained with 1000 samples or more per cluster has an accuracy of 90% or better for both identification and prediction while prediction accuracy scales weakly with the number of lead days. Accuracy scales monotonically but nonlinearly with the size of the training set, e.g. reaching 94% with 3000 training samples per cluster for identification and 93–76% for prediction at lead day 1–5, outperforming logistic regression, a simpler machine learning algorithm, by &nbsp;~&nbsp;25%.

The ACCESS models give good simulations of the global sea-ice, within the scatter of models studied, and is one of the top performing models for sea-ice metrics.

   abstract = {Based upon the climate feedback-responses analysis method, a quantitative attribution analysis is conducted for the annual-mean surface temperature biases in the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). Surface temperature biases are decomposed into partial temperature biases associated with model biases in albedo, water vapor, cloud, sensible/latent heat flux, surface dynamics, and atmospheric dynamics. A globally-averaged cold bias of −1.22 K in CESM1 is largely attributable to albedo bias that accounts for approximately −0.80 K. Over land, albedo bias contributes −1.20 K to the averaged cold bias of −1.45 K. The cold bias over ocean, on the other hand, results from multiple factors including albedo, cloud, oceanic dynamics, and atmospheric dynamics. Bias in the model representation of oceanic dynamics is the primary cause of cold (warm) biases in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere oceans while surface latent heat flux over oceans always acts to compensate for the overall temperature biases. Albedo bias resulted from the model’s simulation of snow cover and sea ice is the main contributor to temperature biases over high-latitude lands and the Arctic and Antarctic region. Longwave effect of water vapor is responsible for an overall warm (cold) bias in the subtropics (tropics) due to an overestimate (underestimate) of specific humidity in the region. Cloud forcing of temperature biases exhibits large regional variations and the model bias in the simulated ocean mixed layer depth is a key contributor to the partial sea surface temperature biases associated with oceanic dynamics. On a global scale, biases in the model representation of radiative processes account more for surface temperature biases compared to non-radiative, dynamical processes.},

   abstract = {The ERA5 reanalysis, recently made available by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), is a new reanalysis product at a high resolution replacing ERA-Interim and is considered to provide the best climate reanalysis over Greenland to date. However, so far little is known about the performance of ERA5 over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). In this study, we compare the near-surface climate from the new ERA5 reanalysis to ERA-Interim, the Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) as well as to a state-of-the-art polar regional climate model (MAR). The results show (1) that ERA5 does not outperform ERA-Interim significantly when compared with near-surface climate observations over GrIS, but ASR better models the near-surface temperature than both ERA reanalyses. (2) Polar regional climate models (e.g., MAR) are still a useful tool to downscale the GrIS climate compared to ERA5, as in particular the near-surface temperature in summer has a key role for representing snow and ice processes such as the surface melt. However, assimilating satellite data and using a more recent radiative scheme enable both ERA and ASR reanalyses to represent more satisfactorily than MAR the downward solar and infrared fluxes. (3) MAR near-surface climate is not affected when forced at its lateral boundaries by either ERA5 or ERA-Interim. Therefore, forcing polar regional climate models with ERA5 starting from 1950 will enable long and homogeneous surface mass balance reconstructions.},

The global reanalysis products generally perform better in summer than in winter, and their qualities vary by glaciological regime. No reanalysis is clearly identified as the optimal dataset for all meteorological parameters, seasons and regions. For all reanalyses, warm biases are observed in the accumulation zone, but cold biases are observed in the ablation area of the GrIS. ERAI, ERA5 and JRA-55 underestimate relative humidity during any month. While MERRA-2 overestimates wind speeds, underestimates are found for the other reanalyses excluding JRA-55 during all months. Despite the robust agreement between the AWS time series for all three variables and each reanalysis product averaged over the ice sheet, sudden jumps occur in annual mean wind speed in CFSR, and in annual relative humidity in JRA-55 from 2010 to 2011.},

Simulated composite GCM surface air temperatures for 1981-2000 are generally 1°-2°C colder than corresponding observations with the exception of a cold bias maximum of 6°-8°C in the Barents Sea. The Barents Sea bias, most prominent in winter and spring, occurs in 12 of the 14 GCMs and corresponds to a region of oversimulated sea ice. All models project a twenty-first-century warming that is largest in the autumn and winter, although the rates of the projected warming vary considerably among the models. The across-model and across-scenario uncertainties in the projected temperatures are comparable through the first half of the twenty-first century, but increases in variability associated with the choice of scenario begin to outpace increases in across-model variability by about the year 2070. By the end of the twenty-first century, the cross-scenario variability is about 50% greater than the across-model variability. The biases of sea level pressure are smaller than in the previous generation of global climate models, although the models still show a positive bias of sea level pressure in the Eurasian sector of the Arctic Ocean, surrounded by an area of negative pressure biases. This bias is consistent with an inability of the North Atlantic storm track to penetrate the Eurasian portion of the Arctic Ocean. The changes of sea level pressure projected for the twenty-first century are negative over essentially the entire Arctic. The most significant decreases of pressure are projected for the Bering Strait region, primarily in autumn and winter. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Monthly climatologies (1971-2000 monthly averages) for stations in the western United States, obtained from the NOAA/National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), are used to illustrate the spatial variations in the annual cycle of climate. Animated map sequences of temperature and precipitation, their average, intermonthly changes, and the local timing of annual maxima or minima provide a comprehensive spatiotemporal baseline of regional climate. The animated maps illustrate three scales of variation: 1) broadscale patterns related to the annual cycle of insolation and hemispheric-scale atmospheric circulation features; 2) mesoscale patterns related to location on the continent and the influence of specific regional circulation features like those associated with the North American monsoon; and 3) smaller-scale spatial variations, related to the mediation by local physiography of the influence of large-scale circulation. Although most western U.S. stations have temperature maxima in July, a delay occurs at stations along the West Coast and interior Washington, northern Idaho, and Montana. A seesaw pattern of precipitation maxima is evident between coastal areas (winter dominated) and the interior (summer dominated). Cluster analyses of the ratio of monthly-to-annual precipitation values for each station identify regions with similar annual cycles of precipitation. Regions of high spatial heterogeneity in the timing of when precipitation occurs include the northern Rocky Mountains, Utah, Arizona, and northwestern Montana. The superimposition of these three scales of spatial variability leads to steep gradients and, in some regions, considerable spatial heterogeneity in annual precipitation. The regional patterns of precipitation heterogeneity highlight vulnerability to drought, especially in regions of the interior west that do not have a dominant precipitation month or season.

Because people are generally averse to uncertainty, this activity has the potential to undermine effective action more than stimulate it. The present research considered how framing climate change predictions differently might moderate the tendency for uncertainty to undermine individual action. Two studies (Ns. = 88 and 120) show that higher uncertainty combined with a negative frame (highlighting possible losses) decreased individual intentions to behave environmentally. However when higher uncertainty was combined with a positive frame (highlighting the possibility of losses not materializing) this produced stronger intentions to act. Study 2 revealed that these effects of uncertainty were mediated through feelings of efficacy. These results suggest that uncertainty is not an inevitable barrier to action, provided communicators frame climate change messages in ways that trigger caution in the face of uncertainty. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Evaluating historical simulations from global climate models (GCMs) remains an important exercise for better understanding future projections of climate change and variability in rapidly warming regions, such as the Arctic. As an alternative approach for comparing climate models and observations, we set up a machine learning classification task using a shallow artificial neural network (ANN). Specifically, we train an ANN on maps of annual mean near-surface temperature in the Arctic from a multi-model large ensemble archive in order to classify which GCM produced each temperature map. After training our ANN on data from the large ensembles, we input annual mean maps of Arctic temperature from observational reanalysis and sort the prediction output according to increasing values of the ANN's confidence for each GCM class. To attempt to understand how the ANN is classifying each temperature map with a GCM, we leverage a feature attribution method from explainable artificial intelligence. By comparing composites from the attribution method for every GCM classification, we find that the ANN is learning regional temperature patterns in the Arctic that are unique to each GCM relative to the multi-model mean ensemble. In agreement with recent studies, we show that ANNs can be useful tools for extracting regional climate signals in GCMs and observations.},

   abstract = {In initialized seasonal to decadal (S2D) predictions, model hindcasts rapidly drift away from the initial observed state and converge toward a preferred state characterized by systematic error, or bias. Bias and drift are among the greatest challenges facing initialized prediction today. Differences in trends between initial states and drifted states, combined with bias and drift, introduce complexities in calculating anomalies to assess skill of initialized predictions. We examine several methods of calculating anomalies using the Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (DPLE) using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) initialized hindcasts and focus on Pacific and Atlantic SSTs to illustrate issues with anomaly calculations. Three methods of computing anomalies, one as differences from a long term model climatology, another as bias-adjusted differences from the previous 15&nbsp;year average from observations, and a third as differences from the previous 15&nbsp;year average from the model, are contrasted and each is shown to have limitations. For the first, trends in bias and drift introduce higher skill estimates earlier and later in the hindcast period due to the trends that contribute to skill. For the second, higher skill can be introduced in situations where low frequency variability in the observations is large compared to the hindcasts on timescales greater than 15&nbsp;years, while lower skill can result if the predicted signal is small and the bias-correction itself produces a transition of SST anomalies to the opposite sign of those that are observed. The third method has somewhat lower skill compared to each of the others, but has less difficulties with not only the long term trends in the model climatology, but also with the unrealistic situational skill from using observations as a reference. However, the first 15&nbsp;years of the hindcast period cannot be evaluated due to having to wait to accumulate the previous 15&nbsp;year model climatology before the method can be applied. The IPO transition in the 2014–2016 time frame from negative to positive (predicted by Meehl et al. in in Nat Commun, 10.1038/NCOMMS11718, 2016) did indeed verify using all three methods, though each provides somewhat different skill values as a result of the respective limitations. There is no clear best method, as all are roughly comparable, and each has its own set of limitations and caveats. However, all three methods show generally higher overall skill in the AMO region compared to the IPO region.},

Here, an ANN is tasked with whether or not there will be a slowdown in the rate of the GMST trend by using maps of ocean heat content at the onset. Through a machine learning explainability method, we find the ANN is learning off-equatorial patterns of anomalous ocean heat content that resemble transitions in the phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in order to make slowdown predictions. Finally, we test our ANN on observed historical data, which further reveals how explainable neural networks are useful tools for understanding decadal variability in both climate models and observations.},

   abstract = {Using GFDL's new coupled model SPEAR, we have developed a decadal coupled reanalysis/initialization system (DCIS) that does not use subsurface ocean observations. In DCIS, the winds and temperature in the atmosphere, along with sea surface temperature (SST), are restored to observations. Under this approach the ocean component of the coupled model experiences a sequence of surface heat and momentum fluxes that are similar to observations. DCIS offers two initialization approaches, called A1 and A2, which differ only in the atmospheric forcing from observations. In A1, the atmospheric winds/temperature are restored toward the JRA reanalysis; in A2, surface pressure observations are assimilated in the model. Two sets of coupled reanalyses have been completed during 1961–2019 using A1 and A2, and they show very similar multi-decadal variations of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Two sets of retrospective decadal forecasts were then conducted using initial conditions from the A1 and A2 reanalyses. In comparison with previous prediction system CM2.1, SPEAR-A1/A2 shows comparable skill of predicting the North Atlantic subpolar gyre SST, which is highly correlated with initial values of AMOC at all lead years. SPEAR-A1 significantly outperforms CM2.1 in predicting multi-decadal SST trends in the Southern Ocean (SO). Both A1 and A2 have skillful prediction of Sahel precipitation and the associated ITCZ shift. The prediction skill of SST is generally lower in A2 than A1 especially over SO presumably due to the sparse surface pressure observations.},

Forecast quality assessment is essential to identify windows of opportunity (e.g., variables, regions, and forecast periods) with skill that can be used to develop climate services to inform users in several sectors and define benchmarks for improvements in forecast systems. This work evaluates the quality of multi-model forecasts of near-surface air temperature, precipitation, Atlantic multi-decadal variability index (AMV) and global near-surface air temperature anomalies (GSAT) generated from all the available retrospective decadal predictions contributing to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The predictions generally show high skill in predicting temperature, AMV, and GSAT, while the skill is more limited for precipitation. Different approaches for generating a multi-model forecast are compared, finding small differences between them. The multi-model ensemble is also compared to the individual forecast systems. The best system usually provides the highest skill. However, the multi-model ensemble is a reasonable choice for not having to select the best system for each particular variable, forecast period and region. Furthermore, the decadal predictions are compared to the historical simulations to estimate the impact of initialization. An added value is found for several ocean and land regions for temperature, AMV, and GSAT, while it is more reduced for precipitation. Moreover, the full ensemble is compared to a sub-ensemble to measure the impact of the ensemble size. Finally, the implications of these results in a climate services context, which requires predictions issued in near real-time, are discussed.</p>},

We provide weighted multimodel projections of Arctic sea ice and temperature as a case study to demonstrate that, for some questions at least, it is meaningless to treat all models equally. The constrained ensemble shows reduced spread and a more rapid sea ice decline than the unweighted ensemble.

Many different methods have been introduced in the emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aims at attributing the network’s prediction to specific features in the input domain. XAI methods are usually assessed by using benchmark datasets (such as MNIST or ImageNet for image classification). However, an objective, theoretically derived ground truth for the attribution is lacking for most of these datasets, making the assessment of XAI in many cases subjective. Also, benchmark datasets specifically designed for problems in geosciences are rare. Here, we provide a framework, based on the use of additively separable functions, to generate attribution benchmark datasets for regression problems for which the ground truth of the attribution is known a priori. We generate a large benchmark dataset and train a fully connected network to learn the underlying function that was used for simulation. We then compare estimated heatmaps from different XAI methods to the ground truth in order to identify examples where specific XAI methods perform well or poorly. We believe that attribution benchmarks as the ones introduced herein are of great importance for further application of neural networks in the geosciences, and for more objective assessment and accurate implementation of XAI methods, which will increase model trust and assist in discovering new science.},

   abstract = {This study explores the role of the stratosphere as a source of seasonal predictability of surface climate over Northern Hemisphere extratropics both in the observations and climate model predictions. A suite of numerical experiments, including climate simulations and retrospective forecasts, are set up to isolate the role of the stratosphere in seasonal predictive skill of extratropical near-surface land temperature. It is shown that most of the lead-0-month spring predictive skill of land temperature over extratropics, particularly over northern Eurasia, stems from stratospheric initialization. It is further revealed that this predictive skill of extratropical land temperature arises from skillful prediction of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). The dynamical connection between the stratosphere and troposphere is also demonstrated by the significant correlation between the stratospheric polar vortex and sea level pressure anomalies, as well as the migration of the stratospheric zonal wind anomalies to the lower troposphere.},

   abstract = {Despite the emerging influence of anthropogenic climate change on the global water cycle, at regional scales the combination of observational uncertainty, large internal variability, and modeling uncertainty undermine robust statements regarding the human influence on precipitation. Here, we use output from global climate models in a perfect-data sense to develop a framework for conducting regional detection and attribution (D&amp;A) for precipitation, starting with the contiguous United States (CONUS) where observational uncertainty is lower than in other regions. Our unified approach can simultaneously detect systematic trends in mean and extreme precipitation, attribute trends to anthropogenic forcings, compute the effects of forcings as a function of time, and map the effects of individual forcings. Model output is used to conduct a set of tests that yield a parsimonious representation for characterizing seasonal precipitation over the CONUS for the historical record (1900 to present day), which ensures our D&amp;A is insensitive to structural uncertainty. Our framework is developed using synthetic data in a Pearl-causal perspective wherein causality can be identified using intervention-based simulations. While the hypothesis-based framework and accompanying generalized D&amp;A formula we develop should be widely applicable, we include a strong caution that the hypothesis-guided simplification of the formula for the historical climatic record of CONUS as described in this paper will likely fail to hold in other geographic regions and under future warming.},

   abstract = {Global climate models represent small-scale processes such as convection using subgrid models known as parameterizations, and these parameterizations contribute substantially to uncertainty in climate projections. Machine learning of new parameterizations from high-resolution model output is a promising approach, but such parameterizations have been prone to issues of instability and climate drift, and their performance for different grid spacings has not yet been investigated. Here we use a random forest to learn a parameterization from&nbsp;coarse-grained output of a three-dimensional high-resolution idealized atmospheric model. The parameterization leads to stable simulations at coarse resolution that replicate the climate of the high-resolution simulation. Retraining for different coarse-graining factors shows the parameterization performs best at smaller horizontal grid spacings. Our results yield insights into parameterization performance across length scales, and they also demonstrate the potential for learning parameterizations from global high-resolution simulations that are now emerging. Machine learning has been used to represent small-scale processes, such as clouds, in atmospheric models but this can lead to instability in simulations of climate. Here, the authors demonstrate a use of machine learning in an atmospheric model that leads to stable simulations of climate at a range of grid spacings.},

   abstract = {Evaluating historical simulations from global climate models (GCMs) remains an important exercise for better understanding future projections of climate change and variability in rapidly warming regions, such as the Arctic. As an alternative approach for comparing climate models and observations, we set up a machine learning classification task using a shallow artificial neural network (ANN). Specifically, we train an ANN on maps of annual mean near-surface temperature in the Arctic from a multi-model large ensemble archive in order to classify which GCM produced each temperature map. After training our ANN on data from the large ensembles, we input annual mean maps of Arctic temperature from observational reanalysis and sort the prediction output according to increasing values of the ANN’s confidence for each GCM class. To attempt to understand how the ANN is classifying each temperature map with a GCM, we leverage a feature attribution method from explainable artificial intelligence. By comparing composites from the attribution method for every GCM classification, we find that the ANN is learning regional temperature patterns in the Arctic that are unique to each GCM relative to the multi-model mean ensemble. In agreement with recent studies, we show that ANNs can be useful tools for extracting regional climate signals in GCMs and observations.},

   abstract = {State-of-the-art climate models predict an enhanced warming over global land areas in response to the greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. In nature, however, the observed land surface warming is not spatially uniform in recent decades as GHG concentration has risen rapidly. There is no warming and even cooling trend in spring northwest North America (NWNA) surface temperature since 1980. Here, we link the observed multidecadal surface cooling trend in NWNA to the weakening of spring Aleutian low (AL), which is ecologically important during the growing season. The AL weakening leads to reductions of southwesterly wind and warm air transport from eastern North Pacific to NWNA. The spring AL weakening and associated NWNA surface cooling are reasonably reproduced by AMIP models, driven by the historical external forcing and imposed sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) from observations. Further investigations into the roles of different forcing components suggest that the changes in the AL are most likely driven by the tropical SST changes in recent decades while the external forcing and SIC play minor roles. There is a zonal dipole pattern of trends in tropical SSTs since 1980, with central-eastern Pacific cooling and warming in other tropical basins, and the atmospheric responses to this SST change show a meridionally propagating Rossby wave train from tropics into subarctic North Pacific, which mediates the SST forcing and the AL changes.},

These individual contributions, and thus the fundamental mechanisms behind changes in climate extremes, remain largely unknown. Here we apply the probability ratio concept in large-ensemble climate simulations to attribute changes in extreme events to either changes in mean climate or climate variability. We show that increased occurrence of monthly high-temperature events is governed by a warming mean climate. In contrast, future changes in monthly heavy-precipitation events depend to a considerable degree on trends in climate variability. Spatial variations are substantial however, highlighting the relevance of regional processes. The contributions of mean and variability to the probability ratio are largely independent of event threshold, magnitude of warming and climate model. Hence projections of temperature extremes are more robust than those of precipitation extremes, since the mean climate is better understood than climate variability. Changes in monthly temperature extremes are governed by mean climate warming, whereas changes in monthly precipitation extremes respond more to changes in variability, suggest analyses of large-ensemble climate simulations.},

   abstract = {In the tropical stratosphere, deep layers of eastward and westward winds encircle the globe and descend regularly from the upper stratosphere to the tropical tropopause. With a complete cycle typically lasting almost 2.5 years, this quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is arguably&nbsp;the most predictable mode of atmospheric variability that is not linked to the changing seasons. The QBO affects climate phenomena outside the tropical stratosphere, including ozone transport, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Madden–Julian Oscillation, and its high predictability could enable better forecasts of these phenomena if models can accurately represent the coupling processes. Climate and forecasting models are increasingly able to simulate stratospheric oscillations resembling the QBO, but exhibit common systematic errors such as weak amplitude in the lowermost tropical stratosphere. Uncertainties about the waves that force the oscillation, particularly the momentum fluxes from small-scale gravity waves excited by deep convection, make its simulation challenging. Improved representation of the processes governing the QBO is expected to lead to better forecasts of the oscillation and its impacts, increased understanding of unusual events such as the two QBO disruptions observed since 2016, and more reliable future projections of QBO behaviour under climate change. The Quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) describes alterations in the direction of tropical stratospheric winds and their downward propagation. This Review outlines the drivers, impacts and projected changes of the QBO, noting a likely weakening amplitude under anthropogenic warming.},

While few indicators were at record levels, the ongoing trends provide a stark illustration of an Arctic that is a very different place than the Arctic of the twentieth century. Air and ocean temperatures in the Arctic are intimately linked with sea ice and are directly connected to the biological productivity of the region. Terrestrial snow cover, or the lack thereof, plays an important role in modulating air temperatures and the hydrologic cycle. During the winter, lower latitude drivers such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Madden-Julian Oscillation, and the evolution of the stratospheric polar vortex affect regional conditions and sub-seasonal variability.

   abstract = {Projected changes in the Northern Hemisphere stratospheric polar vortex are analyzed using Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 experiments. Previous studies showed that projections of the wintertime zonally averaged polar vortex strength diverge widely between climate models with no agreement on the sign of change, and that this uncertainty contributes to the regional climate change uncertainty. Here, we show that there remains large uncertainty in the projected strength of the polar vortex in experiments with global warming levels ranging from moderate (SSP245 runs) to large (Abrupt-4xCO 2 runs), and that the uncertainty maximizes in winter. Partitioning of the uncertainty in wintertime polar vortex strength projections reveals that, by the end of the 21st century, model uncertainty contributes half of the total uncertainty, with scenario uncertainty contributing only 10%. Regression analysis shows that up to 20% of the intermodel spread in projected precipitation over the Iberian Peninsula and northwestern US, and 20%-30% in near-surface temperature over western US and northern Eurasian, can be associated with the spread in vortex strength projections after accounting for global warming. While changes in the magnitude and sign of the zonally averaged vortex strength are uncertain, most models (>95%) predict an eastward shift of the vortex by 8°-20° degrees in longitude relative to its historical location with the magnitude of the shift increasing for larger global warming levels. There is less agreement across models on a latitudinal shift, whose direction and magnitude correlate with changes in the zonally averaged vortex strength so that vortex weakening/strengthening corresponds to a southward/poleward shift. Plain Language Summary Previous studies showed that changes in the strength of the winds in the Northern Hemisphere wintertime stratosphere, the so-called polar vortex, can affect near-surface winds and precipitation on various timescales. However, climate models do not agree on whether the polar vortex will weaken or strengthen during the 21st century. Here, we use Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 experiments to better understand how the polar vortex will respond to future greenhouse gas emissions. We show that half of the uncertainty in the vortex strength projections by the end of the 21st century is due to climate model errors (model uncertainty). We show that the uncertainty in the vortex strength projections is linked to the uncertainty in projected precipitation over the Iberian Peninsula and northwestern US and projected near-surface temperature over the western US and northern Eurasia. Most models predict an eastward shift of the vortex relative to its historical location but we do not detect any influence of the vortex longitudinal shift on surface precipitation and temperatures. There is less agreement across models on a latitudinal shift, whose direction and magnitude correlate with changes in the vortex strength so that vortex weakening/ strengthening corresponds to a southward/poleward shift of the vortex.

   abstract = {As anthropogenic activities warm the Earth, the fundamental solution of reducing greenhouse gas emissions remains elusive. Given this mitigation gap, global warming may lead to intolerable climate changes as adaptive capacity is exceeded. Thus, there is emerging interest in solar radiation modification, which is the process of deliberately increasing Earth’s albedo to cool the planet. Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI)—the theoretical deployment of particles in the stratosphere to enhance reflection of incoming solar radiation—is one strategy to slow, pause, or reverse global warming. If SAI is ever pursued, it will likely be for a specific aim, such as affording time to implement mitigation strategies, lessening extremes, or reducing the odds of reaching a biogeophysical tipping point. Using an ensemble climate model experiment that simulates the deployment of SAI in the context of an intermediate greenhouse gas trajectory, we quantified the probability that internal climate variability masks the effectiveness of SAI deployment on regional temperatures. We found that while global temperature was stabilized, substantial land areas continued to experience warming. For example, in the SAI scenario we explored, up to 55% of the global population experienced rising temperatures over the decade following SAI deployment and large areas exhibited high probability of extremely hot years. These conditions could cause SAI to be perceived as a failure. Countries with the largest economies experienced some of the largest probabilities of this perceived failure. The potential for perceived failure could therefore have major implications for policy decisions in the years immediately following SAI deployment.},

   abstract = {As understanding of the risks and damages of climate change has improved, almost all nations have committed to limit total global warming to less than 2°C over preindustrial levels, with an aspirational target of 1.5°C. Meeting a 2°C target is becoming exceedingly challenging; the global mean temperature has already risen about 1°C over the 20th century. Most climate and integrated assessment models project that the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would have to stop increasing (and perhaps start decreasing) by the second half of the century for there to be a reasonable chance of limiting warming and the associated dangerous climate impacts. Fossil fuel consumption, agriculture, land-use change, and cement production are the dominant anthropogenic sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. The focus of climate mitigation is to reduce energy sector emissions by 80-100%, requiring massive deployment of low-carbon technologies between now and 2050. Progress toward these targets could be made by deploying Negative Emissions Technologies (NETs), which remove carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it. Under the present conditions, where fossil CO2 is continuously added to the atmosphere, removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it has exactly the same impact on the atmosphere and climate as simultaneously preventing emission of an equal amount of CO2. NETs have been part of the portfolio to achieve net emissions reductions, at least since reforestation, afforestation, and soil sequestration were brought into the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, albeit as mitigation options, more than two decades ago. Recent analyses found that deploying NETs may be less expensive and less disruptive than reducing some emissions, such as a substantial portion of agricultural and land-use emissions and some transportation emissions. In 2015, the National Academies published Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration, which described and initially assessed NETs and sequestration technologies. This report acknowledged the relative paucity of research on NETs and recommended development of a research agenda that covers all aspects of NETs from fundamental science to full-scale deployment. To address this need, the National Academies convened the Committee on Developing a Research Agenda for Carbon Dioxide Removal and Sequestration to assess the benefits, risks, and “sustainable scale potential” for NETs and sequestration and to define the essential components of a research and development program, including its estimated costs and potential impact (Box S.1). The full Statement of Task is presented in Box 1.3. The committee held a series of public workshops and meetings to inform its deliberations and the writing of this report. MITIGATION},

   abstract = {Solar geoengineering has been proposed as a means to cool the Earth by increasing the reflection of sunlight back to space, for example, by injecting reflective aerosol particles (or their precursors) into the lower stratosphere. Such proposed techniques would not be able to substitute for mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a response to the risks of climate change, as they would only mask some of the effects of global warming. They might, however, eventually be applied as a complementary approach to reduce climate risks. Thus, the Earth system consequences of solar geoengineering are central to understanding its potentials and risks. Here we review the state-of-the-art knowledge about stratospheric sulfate aerosol injection and an idealized proxy for this, ‘sunshade geoengineering,’ in which the intensity of incoming sunlight is directly reduced in models. Studies are consistent in suggesting that sunshade geoengineering and stratospheric aerosol injection would generally offset the climate effects of elevated GHG concentrations. However, it is clear that a solar geoengineered climate would be novel in some respects, one example being a notably reduced hydrological cycle intensity. Moreover, we provide an overview of nonclimatic aspects of the response to stratospheric aerosol injection, for example, its effect on ozone, and the uncertainties around its consequences. We also consider the issues raised by the partial control over the climate that solar geoengineering would allow. Finally, this overview highlights some key research gaps in need of being resolved to provide sound basis for guidance of future decisions around solar geoengineering.

   abstract = {Solar geoengineering, which seeks to cool the planet by reflecting a small fraction of sunlight back into space, has drawn the attention of scientists and policymakers as climate change remains unabated. Unlike mitigation, solar geoengineering could quickly and cheaply lower global temperatures. It is also imperfect. Its environmental impacts remain unpredictable, and its low cost and immediate effects may result in ‘moral hazard,’ potentially crowding out costly mitigation efforts. There is little understanding about how the public will respond to such tradeoffs. To address this, a 1000-subject nationally representative poll focused on solar geoengineering was conducted as part of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) of the US electorate in October–November 2016. The importance that individuals place on solar geoengineering’s speed and cost predicts their support for it, but there is little to no relationship between their concerns about its shortcomings and support for its research and use. Acquiescence bias appears to be an important factor for attitudes around solar geoengineering and moral hazard.},

   abstract = {Global-scale solar geoengineering is the deliberate modification of the climate system to offset some amount of anthropogenic climate change by reducing the amount of incident solar radiation at the surface. These changes to the planetary energy budget result in differential regional climate effects. For the first time, we quantitatively evaluate the potential for regional disparities in a multi-model context using results from a model experiment that offsets the forcing from a quadrupling of CO2 via reduction in solar irradiance. We evaluate temperature and precipitation changes in 22 geographic regions spanning most of Earths continental area. Moderate amounts of solar reduction (up to 85% of the amount that returns global mean temperatures to preindustrial levels) result in regional temperature values that are closer to preindustrial levels than an un-geoengineered, high CO2 world for all regions and all models. However, in all but one model, there is at least one region for which no amount of solar reduction can restore precipitation toward its preindustrial value. For most metrics considering simultaneous changes in both variables, temperature and precipitation values in all regions are closer to the preindustrial climate for a moderate amount of solar reduction than for no solar reduction. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We discuss experiment designs, as well as the rationale for those designs, showing preliminary results from individual models when available.

   abstract = {Geoengineering methods could potentially offset aspects of greenhouse gas-driven climate change. However, before embarking on any such strategy, a comprehensive understanding of its impacts must be obtained. Here, a 20-member ensemble of simulations with the Community Earth System Model with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model as its atmospheric component is used to investigate the projected hydroclimate changes that occur when greenhouse gas-driven warming, under a high emissions scenario, is offset with stratospheric aerosol geoengineering. Notable features of the late 21st century hydroclimate response, relative to present day, include a reduction in precipitation in the Indian summer monsoon, over much of Africa, Amazonia and southern Chile and a wintertime precipitation reduction over the Mediterranean. Over most of these regions, the soil desiccation that occurs with global warming is, however, largely offset by the geoengineering. A notable exception is India, where soil desiccation and an approximate doubling of the likelihood of monsoon failures occurs. The role of stratospheric heating in the simulated hydroclimate change is determined through additional experiments where the aerosol-induced stratospheric heating is imposed as a temperature tendency, within the same model, under present day conditions. Stratospheric heating is found to play a key role in many aspects of projected hydroclimate change, resulting in a general wet-get-drier, dry-get-wetter pattern in the tropics and extratropical precipitation changes through midlatitude circulation shifts. While a rather extreme geoengineering scenario has been considered, many, but not all, of the precipitation features scale linearly with the offset global warming.},

Using an advanced crop model within an Earth system model, we analysed the yield responses of six major crops to three SG technologies (SGs) and emissions reduction when they provide roughly the same reduction in radiative forcing and assume the same land use. We found sharply distinct yield responses to changes in radiation, moisture and CO2, but comparable significant cooling benefits for crop yields by all four methods. Overall, global yields increase ~10% under the three SGs and decrease 5% under emissions reduction, the latter primarily due to reduced CO2 fertilization, relative to business as usual by the late twenty-first century. Relative humidity dominates the hydrological effect on yields of rainfed crops, with little contribution from precipitation. The net insolation effect is negligible across all SGs, contrary to previous findings.},

While efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to climate impacts are the first line of defense, researchers are exploring other options to reduce warming. Solar geoengineering strategies are designed to cool Earth either by adding small reflective particles to the upper atmosphere, by increasing reflective cloud cover in the lower atmosphere, or by thinning high-altitude clouds that can absorb heat. While such strategies have the potential to reduce global temperatures, they could also introduce an array of unknown or negative consequences. This report concludes that a strategic investment in research is needed to enhance policymakers' understanding of climate response options. The United States should develop a transdisciplinary research program, in collaboration with other nations, to advance understanding of solar geoengineering's technical feasibility and effectiveness, possible impacts on society and the environment, and social dimensions such as public perceptions, political and economic dynamics, and ethical and equity considerations. The program should operate under robust research governance that includes such elements as a research code of conduct, a public registry for research, permitting systems for outdoor experiments, guidance on intellectual property, and inclusive public and stakeholder engagement processes.},

   abstract = {Extreme weather events have been demonstrated to be increasing in frequency and intensity across the globe and are anticipated to increase further with projected changes in climate. Solar climate intervention strategies, specifically stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), have the potential to minimize some of the impacts of a changing climate while more robust reductions in greenhouse gas emissions take effect. However, to date little attention has been paid to the possible responses of extreme weather and climate events under climate intervention scenarios. We present an analysis of 16 extreme surface temperature and precipitation indices, as well as associated vegetation responses, applied to the Geoengineering Large Ensemble (GLENS). GLENS is an ensemble of simulations performed with the Community Earth System Model (CESM1) wherein SAI is simulated to offset the warming produced by a high-emission scenario throughout the 21st century, maintaining surface temperatures at 2020 levels. GLENS is generally successful at maintaining global mean temperature near 2020 levels; however, it does not completely offset some of the projected warming in northern latitudes. Some regions are also projected to cool substantially in comparison to the present day, with the greatest decreases in daytime temperatures. The differential warming–cooling also translates to fewer very hot days but more very hot nights during the summer and fewer very cold days or nights compared to the current day. Extreme precipitation patterns, for the most part, are projected to reduce in intensity in areas that are wet in the current climate and increase in intensity in dry areas. We also find that the distribution of daily precipitation becomes more consistent with more days with light rain and fewer very intense events than currently occur. In many regions there is a reduction in the persistence of long dry and wet spells compared to present day. However, asymmetry in the night and day temperatures, together with changes in cloud cover and vegetative responses, could exacerbate drying in regions that are already sensitive to drought. Overall, our results suggest that while SAI may ameliorate some of the extreme weather hazards produced by global warming, it would also present some significant differences in the distribution of climate extremes compared to the present day.},

These projections, in turn, will rely on simulations with global climate models. As with climate-change projections, these simulations need to adequately span a range of possible futures, describing different choices, such as start date and temperature target, as well as risks, such as termination or interruptions. SRM modeling simulations to date typically consider only a single scenario, often with some unrealistic or arbitrarily chosen elements (such as starting deployment in 2020), and have often been chosen based on scientific rather than policy-relevant considerations (e.g., choosing quite substantial cooling specifically to achieve a bigger response). This limits the ability to compare risks both between SRM and non-SRM scenarios and between different SRM scenarios. To address this gap, we begin by outlining some general considerations on scenario design for SRM. We then describe a specific set of scenarios to capture a range of possible policy choices and uncertainties and present corresponding SAI simulations intended for broad community use.},

   abstract = {Scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are central to climate science and policy. Recent studies find that observed trends and International Energy Agency (IEA) projections of global CO2 emissions have diverged from emission scenario outlooks widely employed in climate research. Here, we quantify the bases for this divergence, focusing on Kaya Identity factors: population, per-capita gross domestic product (GDP), energy intensity (energy consumption/GDP), and carbon intensity (CO2 emissions/energy consumption). We compare 2005-2017 observations and IEA projections to 2040 of these variables, to 'baseline' scenario projections from the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and from the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) used in the upcoming Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We find that the historical divergence of observed CO2 emissions from baseline scenario projections can be explained largely by slower-than-projected per-capita GDP growth - predating the COVID-19 crisis. We also find carbon intensity divergence from baselines in IEA's projections to 2040. IEA projects less coal energy expansion than the baseline scenarios, with divergence expected to continue to 2100. Future economic growth is uncertain, but we show that past divergence from observations makes it unlikely that per-capita GDP growth will catch up to baselines before mid-century. Some experts hypothesize high enough economic growth rates to allow per-capita GDP growth to catch up to or exceed baseline scenarios by 2100. However, we argue that this magnitude of catch-up may be unlikely, in light of: headwinds such as aging and debt, the likelihood of unanticipated economic crises, the fact that past economic forecasts have tended to over-project, the aftermath of the current pandemic, and economic impacts of climate change unaccounted-for in the baseline scenarios. Our analyses inform the rapidly evolving discussions on climate and development futures, and on uses of scenarios in climate science and policy.},

   abstract = {Over the last five years prior to the Glasgow Climate Pact1, 154 Parties have submitted new or updated 2030 mitigation goals in their nationally determined contributions and 76 have put forward longer-term pledges. Quantifications of the pledges before the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) suggested a less than 50 per cent chance of keeping warming below 2 degrees Celsius2–5. Here we show that warming can be kept just below 2 degrees Celsius if all conditional and unconditional pledges are implemented in full and on time. Peak warming could be limited to 1.9–2.0 degrees Celsius (5%–95% range 1.4–2.8 °C) in the full implementation case—building on a probabilistic characterization of Earth system uncertainties in line with the Working Group I contribution to the&nbsp;Sixth Assessment Report6 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We retrospectively project twenty-first-century warming to show how the aggregate level of ambition changed from 2015 to 2021. Our results rely on the extrapolation of time-limited targets beyond 2030 or 2050, characteristics of the IPCC 1.5 °C Special Report (SR1.5) scenario database7 and the full implementation of pledges. More pessimistic assumptions on these factors would lead to higher temperature projections. A second, independent emissions modelling framework projected peak warming of 1.8 degrees Celsius, supporting the finding that realized pledges could limit warming to just below 2 degrees Celsius. Limiting warming not only to ‘just below’ but to ‘well below’ 2 degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees Celsius urgently requires policies and actions to bring about steep emission reductions this decade, aligned with mid-century global net-zero CO2 emissions. If all new and updated national climate change mitigation pledges stemming from the Paris Agreement are implemented in full and on time, then 21st-century warming could be limited to just below 2 degrees Celsius.},

Though the growth rate of global carbon dioxide emissions has slowed and many countries have strengthened their emissions targets, current midcentury net zero goals are insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5C above preindustrial temperatures. The primary barriers to the achievement of a 1.5C-compatible pathway are not geophysical but rather reflect inertia in our political and technological systems. Both political and corporate leadership are needed to overcome this inertia, supported by increased societal recognition of the need for system-level and individual lifestyle changes. The available evidence does not yet indicate that the world has seriously committed to achieving the 1.5C goal.},

Synthesizing paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies, we provide a revised shortlist of global "core" tipping elements and regional "impact" tipping elements and their temperature thresholds. Current global warming of ∼1.1°C above preindustrial temperatures already lies within the lower end of some tipping point uncertainty ranges. Several tipping points may be triggered in the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to <2°C global warming, with many more likely at the 2 to 3°C of warming expected on current policy trajectories. This strengthens the evidence base for urgent action to mitigate climate change and to develop improved tipping point risk assessment, early warning capability, and adaptation strategies.},

   abstract = {Extreme event attribution aims to elucidate the link between global climate change, extreme weather events, and the harms experienced on the ground by people, property, and nature. It therefore allows the disentangling of different drivers of extreme weather from human-induced climate change and hence provides valuable information to adapt to climate change and to assess loss and damage. However, providing such assessments systematically is currently out of reach. This is due to limitations in attribution science, including the capacity for studying different types of events, as well as the geographical heterogeneity of both climate and impact data availability. Here, we review current knowledge of the influences of climate change on five different extreme weather hazards (extreme temperatures, heavy rainfall, drought, wildfire, tropical cyclones), the impacts of recent extreme weather events of each type, and thus the degree to which various impacts are attributable to climate change. For instance, heat extremes have increased in likelihood and intensity worldwide due to climate change, with tens of thousands of deaths directly attributable. This is likely a significant underestimate due to the limited availability of impact information in lower- and middle-income countries. Meanwhile, tropical cyclone rainfall and storm surge height have increased for individual events and across all basins. In the North Atlantic basin, climate change amplified the rainfall of events that, combined, caused half a trillion USD in damages. At the same time, severe droughts in many parts of the world are not attributable to climate change. To advance our understanding of present-day extreme weather impacts due to climate change developments on several levels are required. These include improving the recording of extreme weather impacts around the world, improving the coverage of attribution studies across different events and regions, and using attribution studies to explore the contributions of both climate and non-climate drivers of impacts.},

   abstract = { Previous work identified an anthropogenic fingerprint pattern in T AC ( x , t ), the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of mid- to upper-tropospheric temperature (TMT), but did not explicitly consider whether fingerprint identification in satellite T AC ( x , t ) data could have been influenced by real-world multidecadal internal variability (MIV). We address this question here using large ensembles (LEs) performed with five climate models. LEs provide many different sequences of internal variability noise superimposed on an underlying forced signal. Despite differences in historical external forcings, climate sensitivity, and MIV properties of the five models, their T AC ( x , t ) fingerprints are similar and statistically identifiable in 239 of the 240 LE realizations of historical climate change. Comparing simulated and observed variability spectra reveals that consistent fingerprint identification is unlikely to be biased by model underestimates of observed MIV. Even in the presence of large (factor of 3–4) intermodel and inter-realization differences in the amplitude of MIV, the anthropogenic fingerprints of seasonal cycle changes are robustly identifiable in models and satellite data. This is primarily due to the fact that the distinctive, global-scale fingerprint patterns are spatially dissimilar to the smaller-scale patterns of internal T AC ( x , t ) variability associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation and El Niño–Southern Oscillation. The robustness of the seasonal cycle detection and attribution results shown here, taken together with the evidence from idealized aquaplanet simulations, suggest that basic physical processes are dictating a common pattern of forced T AC ( x , t ) changes in observations and in the five LEs. The key processes involved include GHG-induced expansion of the tropics, lapse-rate changes, land surface drying, and sea ice decrease. },

   abstract = {Rising emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) have led to tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling over recent decades. As a thermodynamic consequence, the troposphere has expanded and the rise of the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, has been suggested as one of the most robust fingerprints of anthropogenic climate change. Conversely, at altitudes above ∼55 km (in the mesosphere and thermosphere) observational and modeling evidence indicates a downward shift of the height of pressure levels or decreasing density at fixed altitudes. The layer in between, the stratosphere, has not been studied extensively with respect to changes of its global structure. Here we show that this atmospheric layer has contracted substantially over the last decades, and that the main driver for this are increasing concentrations of GHG. Using data from coupled chemistry-climate models we show that this trend will continue and the mean climatological thickness of the stratosphere will decrease by 1.3 km following representative concentration pathway 6.0 by 2080. We also demonstrate that the stratospheric contraction is not only a response to cooling, as changes in both tropopause and stratopause pressure contribute. Moreover, its short emergence time (less than 15 years) makes it a novel and independent indicator of GHG induced climate change.},

SLF have been previously derived from a combination of modeled and observed mass fluxes from the continents into the ocean. Here we derive improved SLF from time series of time variable gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission for April 2002 to October 2014. We evaluate the GRACE-derived SLF using ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data from stations in the tropics, where OBP errors are the lowest. We detect the annual phase of the SLF in the OBP signal and separate it unambiguously from the barystatic sea level (BSL) at two stations. At the basin scale, the SLF explain a larger fraction of the variance in steric-corrected altimetry than the BSL, which has implications for evaluating mass transport between ocean basins.},

Arctic sea ice (7.6 trillion tonnes), Antarctic ice shelves (6.5 trillion tonnes), mountain glaciers (6.1 trillion tonnes), the Greenland ice sheet (3.8 trillion tonnes), the Antarctic ice sheet (2.5 trillion tonnes), and Southern Ocean sea ice (0.9 trillion tonnes) have all decreased in mass. Just over half (58 %) of the ice loss was from the Northern Hemisphere, and the remainder (42 %) was from the Southern Hemisphere. The rate of ice loss has risen by 57 % since the 1990s - from 0.8 to 1.2 trillion tonnes per year - owing to increased losses from mountain glaciers, Antarctica, Greenland and from Antarctic ice shelves. During the same period, the loss of grounded ice from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets and mountain glaciers raised the global sea level by 34.6 ± 3.1 mm. The majority of all ice losses were driven by atmospheric melting (68 % from Arctic sea ice, mountain glaciers ice shelf calving and ice sheet surface mass balance), with the remaining losses (32 % from ice sheet discharge and ice shelf thinning) being driven by oceanic melting. Altogether, these elements of the cryosphere have taken up 3.2 % of the global energy imbalance.},

However, estimates of the magnitude of decadal-scale variability from models and observations are uncertain, limiting determination of the fraction of warming attributable to external forcing. Here, we use statistical learning to extract a fingerprint of climate change that is robust to different model representations and magnitudes of internal variability. We find a best estimate forced warming trend of 0.8°C over the past 40 years, slightly larger than observed. It is extremely likely that at least 85% is attributable to external forcing based on the median variability across climate models. Detection remains robust even when evaluated against models with high variability and if decadal-scale variability were doubled. This work addresses a long-standing limitation in attributing warming to external forcing and opens up opportunities even in the case of large model differences in decadal-scale variability, model structural uncertainty, and limited observational records.},

For 2050, considering all TRLs, we showed that only products storing CO2 permanently or produced from only zero-emissions energy can be Paris compatible.

As such, our confidence in projections of solar geoengineering, the basis for that confidence and how our confidence can be improved is limited. In this Perspective, we review our current understanding of uncertainty and risk in solar geoengineering via stratospheric aerosols. Using a risk-register framework, we illustrate key uncertainties, such as sub-grid-scale mixing or effects of stratospheric heating, investigations of which should be prioritized to transition the field to a mission-driven research agenda.

It is controversial and raises novel governance challenges [T. C. Schelling, Climatic Change, 33, 303-307 (1996); J. Virgoe, Climatic Change, 95, 103-119 (2008)]. We focus on the strategic implications of solar geoengineering. When countries engineer the climate, conflict can arise because different countries might prefer different temperatures. This would result in too much geoengineering: the country with the highest preference for geoengineering cools the planet beyond what is socially optimal at the expense of the others-a theoretical possibility termed "free-driving" [M. L. Weitzman, Scand. J. Econ., 117, 1049-1068 (2015)]. This study is an empirical test of this hypothesis. We carry out an economic laboratory experiment based on a public "good or bad" game. We find compelling evidence of free-driving: global geoengineering exceeds the socially efficient level and leads to welfare losses. We also evaluate the possibility of counteracting the geoengineering efforts of others. Results show that countergeoengineering generates high payoff inequality as well as heavy welfare losses, resulting from both strategic and behavioral factors. Finally, we compare strategic behavior in bilateral and multilateral settings. We find that welfare deteriorates even more under multilateralism when countergeoengineering is a possibility. These results have general implications for governing global good or bad commons.},

While volcanic eruptions have been suggested as innocuous examples of stratospheric aerosols cooling the planet, the volcano analog actually argues against geoengineering because of ozone depletion and regional hydrologic and temperature responses. To further investigate the climate response, here we simulate the climate response to both tropical and Arctic stratospheric injection of sulfate aerosol precursors using a comprehensive atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE. We inject SO2 and the model converts it to sulfate aerosols, transports the aerosols and removes them through dry and wet deposition, and calculates the climate response to the radiative forcing from the aerosols. We conduct simulations of future climate with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B business-as-usual scenario both with and without geoengineering and compare the results. We find that if there were a way to continuously inject SO2 into the lower stratosphere, it would produce global cooling. Tropical SO2 injection would produce sustained cooling over most of the world, with more cooling over continents. Arctic SO2 injection would not just cool the Arctic. Both tropical and Arctic SO2 injection would disrupt the Asian and African summer monsoons, reducing precipitation to the food supply for billions of people. These regional climate anomalies are but one of many reasons that argue against the implementation of this kind of geoengineering. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {Volcanic eruptions are an important natural cause of climate change on many timescales. A new capability to predict the climatic response to a large tropical eruption for the succeeding 2 years will prove valuable to society. In addition, to detect and attribute anthropogenic influences on climate, including effects of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and ozone-depleting chemicals, it is crucial to quantify the natural fluctuations so as to separate them from anthropogenic fluctuations in the climate record. Studying the responses of climate to volcanic eruptions also helps us to better understand important radiative and dynamical processes that respond in the climate system to both natural and anthropogenic forcings. Furthermore, modeling the effects of volcanic eruptions helps us to improve climate models that are needed to study anthropogenic effects. Large volcanic eruptions inject sulfur gases into the stratosphere, which convert to sulfate aerosols with an e-folding residence time of about 1 year. Large ash particles fall out much quicker. The radiative and chemical effects of this aerosol cloud produce responses in the climate system. By scattering some solar radiation back to space, the aerosols cool the surface, but by absorbing both solar and terrestrial radiation, the aerosol layer heats the stratosphere. For a tropical eruption this heating is larger in the tropics than in the high latitudes, producing an enhanced pole-to-equator temperature gradient, especially in winter. In the Northern Hemisphere winter this enhanced gradient produces a stronger polar vortex, and this stronger jet stream produces a characteristic stationary wave pattern of tropospheric circulation, resulting in winter warming of Northern Hemisphere continents. This indirect advective effect on temperature is stronger than the radiative cooling effect that dominates at lower latitudes and in the summer. The volcanic aerosols also serve as surfaces for heterogeneous chemical reactions that destroy stratospheric ozone, which lowers ultraviolet absorption and reduces the radiative heating in the lower stratosphere, but the net effect is still heating. Because this chemical effect depends on the presence of anthropogenic chlorine, it has only become important in recent decades. For a few days after an eruption the amplitude of the diurnal cycle of surface air temperature is reduced under the cloud. On a much longer timescale, volcanic effects played a large role in interdecadal climate change of the Little Ice Age. There is no perfect index of past volcanism, but more ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica will improve the record. There is no evidence that volcanic eruptions produce El Niño events, but the climatic effects of El Nino and volcanic eruptions must be separated to understand the climatic response to each.},

Improved horizontal resolution, dynamics, and chemistry now produce an internally generated quasi-biennial oscillation and significant improvements to stratospheric temperatures and ozone compared to observations. We present a validation of WACCM column ozone and climate calculations against observations. The prognostic treatment of stratospheric sulfate aerosols accurately represents the evolution of stratospheric aerosol optical depth and perturbations to solar and longwave radiation following the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. We confirm the inclusion of interactive OH chemistry as an important factor in the formation and initial distribution of aerosol following large inputs of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the stratosphere. We calculate that depletion of OH levels within the dense SO2 cloud in the first weeks following the Pinatubo eruption significantly prolonged the average initial e-folding decay time for SO2 oxidation to 47 days. Previous observational and model studies showing a 30 day decay time have not accounted for the large (30–55%) losses of SO2 on ash and ice within 7–9 days posteruption and have not correctly accounted for OH depletion. We examine the variability of aerosol evolution in free-running climate simulations due to meteorology, with comparison to simulations nudged with specified dynamics. We assess calculated impacts of volcanic aerosols on ozone loss with comparisons to observations. The completeness of the chemistry, dynamics, and aerosol microphysics in WACCM qualify it for studies of stratospheric sulfate aerosol geoengineering.},

   abstract = {Changes in ocean heat content (OHC) provide a measure of ocean warming, with impacts on the Earth system. This Review synthesizes estimates of past and future OHC changes using observations and models. The top 2,000 m of the global ocean has significantly warmed since the 1950s, gaining 351 ± 59.8 ZJ (1 ZJ = 1021 J) from 1958 to 2019. The rate of warming increased from &lt;5 to ~10 ZJ yr−1 from the 1960s to the 2010s. Observed area-averaged warming is largest in the Atlantic Ocean and southern oceans at 1.42 ± 0.09 and 1.40 ± 0.09 × 109 J m−2, respectively, for the upper 2,000 m over 1958–2019. These observed patterns of heat gains are dominated by heat redistribution. Observationally constrained projections suggest that historic ocean warming is irreversible this century, with net warming dependent on the emission scenario. By 2100, projected warming in the top 2,000 m is 2–6 times that observed so far, ranging from 1,030 [839–1,228] ZJ for a low-emission scenario to 1,874 [1,637–2,109] ZJ for a high-emission scenario. The Pacific is projected to be the largest heat reservoir owing to its size, but area-averaged warming remains strongest in the Atlantic and southern oceans. Ocean warming has extensive impacts that pose risks to marine ecosystems and society. The projected changes necessitate a continuation and improvement of observations and models, along with better uncertainty estimation. Greenhouse gas forcing has increased ocean heat content, with large impacts on the Earth system. This Review outlines observed and projected global and regional changes, revealing an observed 0–2,000 m global increase of 351.4 ± 59.8 ZJ from 1958 to 2019, and a projected increase of 1,874 [1,637–2,109] ZJ by 2100 under SSP5-8.5.},

Here, CESM2's representation of the large-scale atmospheric circulation and its variability is assessed. Further context is providedthrough comparison to the CESM1 large ensemble and other models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6). This includes an assessment of the representation of jet streams and storm tracks, stationary waves, the global divergent circulation, the annular modes, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and blocking. Compared to CESM1, CESM2 is substantially improved in the representation of the storm tracks, Northern Hemisphere (NH) stationary waves, NH winter blocking and the global divergent circulation. It ranks within the top 10% of CMIP class models in many of these features. Some features of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) circulation have degraded, such as the SH jet strength, stationary waves, and blocking, although the SH jet stream is placed at approximately the correct location. This analysis also highlights systematic deficiencies in these features across the new CMIP6 archive, such as the continued tendency for the SH jet stream to be placed too far equatorward, the North Atlantic westerlies to be too strong over Europe, the storm tracks as measured by low-level meridional wind variance to be too weak and a lack of blocking in the North Atlantic sector.},

   abstract = {If solar radiation management (SRM) were ever implemented, feedback of the observed climate state might be used to adjust the radiative forcing of SRM in order to compensate for uncertainty in either the forcing or the climate response. Feedback might also compensate for unexpected changes in the system, e.g. a nonlinear change in climate sensitivity. However, in addition to the intended response to greenhouse-gas induced changes, the use of feedback would also result in a geoengineering response to natural climate variability. We use a box-diffusion dynamic model of the climate system to understand how changing the properties of the feedback control affect the emergent dynamics of this coupled human-climate system, and evaluate these predictions using the HadCM3L general circulation model. In particular, some amplification of natural variability is unavoidable; any time delay (e.g., to average out natural variability, or due to decision-making) exacerbates this amplification, with oscillatory behavior possible if there is a desire for rapid correction (high feedback gain). This is a challenge for policy as a delayed response is needed for decision making. Conversely, the need for feedback to compensate for uncertainty, combined with a desire to avoid excessive amplification of natural variability, results in a limit on how rapidly SRM could respond to changes in the observed state of the climate system. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {We describe the first simulations of stratospheric sulfate aerosol geoengineering using multiple injection locations to meet multiple simultaneous surface temperature objectives. Simulations were performed using CESM1(WACCM), a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model with fully interactive stratospheric chemistry, dynamics (including an internally generated quasi-biennial oscillation), and a sophisticated treatment of sulfate aerosol formation, microphysical growth, and deposition. The objectives are defined as maintaining three temperature features at their 2020 levels against a background of the RCP8.5 scenario over the period 2020–2099. These objectives are met using a feedback mechanism in which the rate of sulfur dioxide injection at each of the four locations is adjusted independently every year of simulation. Even in the presence of uncertainties, nonlinearities, and variability, the objectives are met, predominantly by SO2 injection at 30 ° N and 30° S. By the last year of simulation, the feedback algorithm calls for a total injection rate of 51 Tg SO2 per year. The injections are not in the tropics, which results in a greater degree of linearity of the surface climate response with injection amount than has been found in many previous studies using injection at the equator. Because the objectives are defined in terms of annual mean temperature, the required geongineering results in “overcooling” during summer and “undercooling” during winter. The hydrological cycle is also suppressed as compared to the reference values corresponding to the year 2020. The demonstration we describe in this study is an important step toward understanding what geoengineering can do and what it cannot do.},

Traditionally, tools for extracting forced climate change signals have focused on one atmospheric variable at a time, however, using multiple variables can reduce noise and allow for easier detection of the forced response. Following previous work, we train artificial neural networks to predict the year of single- and multi-variable maps from forced climate model simulations. To perform this task, the neural networks learn patterns that allow them to discriminate between maps from different years—that is, the neural networks learn the patterns of the forced signal amidst the shroud of internal variability and climate model disagreement. When presented with combined input fields (multiple seasons, variables, or both), the neural networks are able to detect the signal of forced change earlier than when given single fields alone by utilizing complex, nonlinear relationships between multiple variables and seasons. We use layer-wise relevance propagation, a neural network explainability tool, to identify the multivariate patterns learned by the neural networks that serve as reliable indicators of the forced response. These “indicator patterns” vary in time and between climate models, providing a template for investigating inter-model differences in the time evolution of the forced response. This work demonstrates how neural networks and their explainability tools can be harnessed to identify patterns of the forced signal within combined fields.},

   abstract = {High- and low pressure systems of the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the mid-latitudes drive European weather and climate. Potential future changes in the occurrence of circulation types are highly relevant for society. Classifying the highly dynamic atmospheric circulation into discrete classes of circulation types helps to categorize the linkages between atmospheric forcing and surface conditions (e.g. extreme events). Previous studies have revealed a high internal variability of projected changes of circulation types. Dealing with this high internal variability requires the employment of a single-model initial-condition large ensemble (SMILE) and an automated classification method, which can be applied to large climate data sets. One of the most established classifications in Europe are the 29 subjective circulation types called Grosswetterlagen by Hess & Brezowsky (HB circulation types). We developed, in the first analysis of its kind, an automated version of this subjective classification using deep learning. Our classifier reaches an overall accuracy of 41.1% on the test sets of nested cross-validation. It outperforms the state-of-the-art automatization of the HB circulation types in 20 of the 29 classes. We apply the deep learning classifier to the SMHI-LENS, a SMILE of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6, composed of 50 members of the EC-Earth3 model under the SSP37.0 scenario. For the analysis of future frequency changes of the 29 circulation types, we use the signal-to-noise ratio to discriminate the climate change signal from the noise of internal variability. Using a 5%-significance level, we find significant frequency changes in 69% of the circulation types when comparing the future (2071-2100) to a reference period (1991-2020).},

   abstract = {This is a test case study assessing the ability of deep learning methods to generalize to a future climate (end of 21st century) when trained to classify thunderstorms in model output representative of the present-day climate. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to classify strongly rotating thunderstorms from a current climate created using the Weather Research and Forecasting model at high-resolution, then evaluated against thunderstorms from a future climate and found to perform with skill and comparatively in both climates. Despite training with labels derived from a threshold value of a severe thunderstorm diagnostic (updraft helicity), which was not used as an input attribute, the CNN learned physical characteristics of organized convection and environments that are not captured by the diagnostic heuristic. Physical features were not prescribed but rather learned from the data, such as the importance of dry air at mid-levels for intense thunderstorm development when low-level moisture is present (i.e., convective available potential energy). Explanation techniques also revealed that thunderstorms classified as strongly rotating are associated with learned rotation signatures. Results show that the creation of synthetic data with ground truth is a viable alternative to human-labeled data and that a CNN is able to generalize a target using learned features that would be difficult to encode due to spatial complexity. Most importantly, results from this study show that deep learning is capable of generalizing to future climate extremes and can exhibit out-of-sample robustness with hyperparameter tuning in certain applications.},

efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling

data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are
discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable
to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.
Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares
favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax,

   abstract = {Tropospheric anthropogenic aerosols contribute the second-largest forcing to climate change, but with high uncertainty owing to their spatio-temporal variability and complicated optical properties. In this Review, we synthesize understanding of aerosol observations and their radiative and climate effects. Aerosols offset about one-third of the warming effect by anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Yet, in regions and seasons where the absorbing aerosol fraction is high — such as South America and East and South Asia — substantial atmospheric warming can occur. The internal mixing and the vertical distribution of aerosols, which alters both the direct effect and aerosol–cloud interactions, might further enhance this warming. Despite extensive research in aerosol–cloud interactions, there is still at least a 50% spread in total aerosol forcing estimates. This ongoing uncertainty is linked, in part, to the poor measurement of anthropogenic and natural aerosol absorption, as well as the little-understood effects of aerosols on clouds. Next-generation, space-borne, multi-angle polarization and active remote sensing, combined with in situ observations, offer opportunities to better constrain aerosol scattering, absorption and size distribution, thus, improving models to refine estimates of aerosol forcing and climate effects. Atmospheric aerosols alter Earth’s radiation balance and serve as cloud condensation nuclei, but their climate forcing potential is poorly understood. This Review describes the occurrence of aerosols in the atmosphere, assesses the known impact on climate and proposes approaches to further constrain their climate effects.},

We examine the increased rate of precipitation extremes with global mean surface warming in the 21st century caused by anthropogenic GHGs and aerosols, using an Earth system model ensemble simulation. Similar to mean precipitation, the increased rate of precipitation extremes caused by aerosol forcing is significantly larger than that caused by GHG forcing. The aerosol forcing in the coming decades can play a critical role in inducing change in precipitation extremes if a lower GHG emission pathway is adopted.

However, not all monsoon areas get wetter - there is a need to understand the major factors behind changes in regional monsoon precipitation, in terms of external forcing and internal variabilities in the last six decades by a combination of different observed datasets and model runs. We have found that time of emergence of anthropogenic signals is robustly detected in the northern African monsoon before the 1990s with the use of the CESM Large Ensemble Project. From CMIP5 model runs and three reanalysis datasets, the results found are that the change in rainfall over African monsoon (AFM) is mainly due to anthropogenic forcing and that over Asian-Australian monsoon (AAM) is affected by internal variability. Moreover, the cause of American monsoon (AMM) rainfall change cannot be known due to a discrepancy among observed datasets. Here we show that the asymmetry between Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) parts by green-house gas (GHG) is detected over the AFM and AAM regions. However, the land monsoon rainfall in the northern AMM is decreased by a combination of GHG and aerosol forcing. In general, the aerosol forcing causes a decreasing rainfall over the monsoon regions. In future projection, the land rainfall over the AAM and AMM are expected to increase and decrease in the future from most models' results. The asymmetry between an increase in NH and a decrease in SH is dominant in the future from most models' future simulation results, which is well shown over the AFM and AAM. This study suggests that the physical process of GHG and aerosol effects in rainfall should be explored in the context of regional aspects.},

The composite analysis is conducted using the 1982-2010 hindcasts for each of the six models with selected ENSO episodes based on the seasonal oceanic Niño index just prior to the date the forecasts were initiated. Two types of composites are constructed over the North American continent: one based on mean precipitation and temperature anomalies and the other based on their probability of occurrence in a tercile-based system. The composites apply to monthly mean conditions in November, December, January, February, and March as well as to the 5-month aggregates representing the winter conditions. For anomaly composites, the anomaly correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error against the observed composites are used for the evaluation. For probability composites, a new probability anomaly correlation measure and a root-mean probability score are developed for the assessment. All NMME models predict ENSO precipitation patterns well during wintertime; however, some models have large discrepancies between the model temperature composites and the observed. The fidelity is greater for the multimodel ensemble as well as for the 5-month aggregates. February tends to have higher scores than other winter months. For anomaly composites, most models perform slightly better in predicting El Niño patterns than La Niña patterns. For probability composites, all models have superior performance in predicting ENSO precipitation patterns than temperature patterns.},

However, more research is needed, as there are significant uncertainties surrounding the possible impacts of SCI, including unforeseen effects on regional climate patterns. In this study, we consider a climate model simulation of the deployment of stratospheric aerosols to maintain the global mean surface temperature at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Leveraging two different machine learning methods, we evaluate when the effects of SCI would be detectable at regional scales. Specifically, we train a logistic regression model to classify whether an annual mean map of near-surface temperature or total precipitation is from a future climate under the influence of SCI or not. We then design an artificial neural network to predict how many years it has been since the deployment of SCI by inputting the regional maps from the climate intervention scenario. In both detection methods, we use feature attribution methods to spatially understand the forced climate patterns that are important for the machine learning model predictions. The effect of SCI on regional temperature patterns is detectable in under a decade for most regions. However, the effect of SCI on regional precipitation patterns is more difficult to distinguish due to the presence of internal climate variability.},

   abstract = {Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering could be used to maintain global mean temperature despite increased atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, for example, to meet a 1.5 or 2 °C target. While this might reduce many climate change impacts, the resulting climate would not be the same as one with the same global mean temperature due to lower GHG concentrations. The primary question we consider is how long it would take to detect these differences in a hypothetical deployment. We use a 20-member ensemble of stratospheric sulfate aerosol geoengineering simulations in which SO 2 is injected at four different latitudes to maintain not just the global mean temperature, but also the interhemispheric and equator-to-pole gradients. This multiple-latitude strategy better matches the climate changes from increased GHG, while the ensemble allows us both to estimate residual differences even when they are small compared to natural variability and to estimate the statistics of variability. We first construct a linear emulator to predict the model responses for different scenarios. Under an RCP4.5 scenario in which geoengineering maintains a 1.5 °C target (providing end-of-century cooling of 1.7 °C), the projected changes in temperature, precipitation, and precipitation minus evaporation (P − E) at a grid-scale are typically small enough that in many regions the signal-to-noise ratio is still less than one at the end of this century; for example, for P − E, only 30% of the land area reaches a signal-to-noise ratio of one. These results provide some context for the projected magnitude of climate changes associated with a limited deployment of stratospheric aerosol cooling.},

Using results from 19 climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), we report a persistent dependence of warm bias on dry bias with the precipitation deficit leading the warm bias over this region. The precipitation deficit is associated with the widespread failure of models in capturing strong rainfall events in summer over the central U.S. A robust linear relationship between the projected warming and the present-day warm bias enables us to empirically correct future temperature projections. By the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario, the corrections substantially narrow the intermodel spread of the projections and reduce the projected temperature by 2.5 K, resulting mainly from the removal of the warm bias. Instead of a sharp decrease, after this correction the projected precipitation is nearly neutral for all scenarios. Climate models repeatedly show a warm and dry bias over the central United States, but the origin of this bias remains unclear. Here the authors associate this bias to precipitation deficits in models and after applying a correction, projected precipitation in this region shows no significant changes.},

For the first time, we quantitatively evaluate the potential for regional disparities in a multi-model context using results from a model experiment that offsets the forcing from a quadrupling of CO2 via reduction in solar irradiance. We evaluate temperature and precipitation changes in 22 geographic regions spanning most of Earths continental area. Moderate amounts of solar reduction (up to 85% of the amount that returns global mean temperatures to preindustrial levels) result in regional temperature values that are closer to preindustrial levels than an un-geoengineered, high CO2 world for all regions and all models. However, in all but one model, there is at least one region for which no amount of solar reduction can restore precipitation toward its preindustrial value. For most metrics considering simultaneous changes in both variables, temperature and precipitation values in all regions are closer to the preindustrial climate for a moderate amount of solar reduction than for no solar reduction. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

An analysis of a large-ensemble simulation of 54 temperature-stabilization scenarios suggests that it may not be possible to achieve climate stabilization through management of solar radiation simultaneously in all regions. Concerns about the slow pace of climate mitigation have led to renewed dialogue about solar-radiation management, which could be achieved by adding reflecting aerosols to the stratosphere1,2,3,4,5,6. Modelling studies suggest that solar-radiation management could produce stabilized global temperatures and reduced global precipitation4,5,6. Here we present an analysis of regional differences in a climate modified by solar-radiation management, using a large-ensemble modelling experiment that examines the impacts of 54 scenarios for global temperature stabilization. Our results confirm that solar-radiation management would generally lead to less extreme temperature and precipitation anomalies, compared with unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions. However, they also illustrate that it is physically not feasible to stabilize global precipitation and temperature simultaneously as long as atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise. Over time, simulated temperature and precipitation in large regions such as China and India vary significantly with different trajectories for solar-radiation management, and they diverge from historical baselines in different directions. Hence, it may not be possible to stabilize the climate in all regions simultaneously using solar-radiation management. Regional diversity in the response to different levels of solar-radiation management could make consensus about the optimal level of geoengineering difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.},

   abstract = {Sulphate aerosol injection has been widely discussed as a possible way to engineer future climate. Monitoring it would require detecting its effects amidst internal variability and in the presence of other external forcings. We investigate how the use of different detection methods and filtering techniques affects the detectability of sulphate aerosol geoengineering in annual-mean global-mean near-surface air temperature. This is done by assuming a future scenario that injects 5 Tg yr−1 of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere and cross-comparing simulations from 5 climate models. 64% of the studied comparisons would require 25 years or more for detection when no filter and the multi-variate method that has been extensively used for attributing climate change are used, while 66% of the same comparisons would require fewer than 10 years for detection using a trend-based filter. This highlights the high sensitivity of sulphate aerosol geoengineering detectability to the choice of filter. With the same trend-based filter but a non-stationary method, 80% of the comparisons would require fewer than 10 years for detection. This does not imply sulphate aerosol geoengineering should be deployed, but suggests that both detection methods could be used for monitoring geoengineering in global, annual mean temperature should it be needed.},

   abstract = {We assess the detection and attribution (D&A) of climate engineering (CE) as a function of their duration after initiation. We employ “surrogate” climates where observations are mimicked by simulations. Unlike classical, stationary D&A, the null hypothesis for this analysis is the nonstationary gradual warming caused by continued greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing, which creates a number of theoretical and technical complications. Adapting D&A to this nonstationary setting requires several ad hoc assumptions whose validity is analyzed and discussed. We study the stratospheric sulfur injection scenarios G3 and G4 of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project. For G3, which smoothly balances global warming with a corresponding cooling, the effect is smaller initially and harder to detect. Temperature and precipitation signals are detectable about a decade after commencing CE and attributable a few years later (details depending on model and scenario). The G4 scenario consists of a continuous injection of 5 Tg SO2 (roughly one fourth of the Pinatubo eruption per year), which represents a shock-like forcing that is easier and earlier detectable, just after a few years. Later into the century, uncertainty in GHG sensitivity increasingly dominates the background noise, hampering G4 detection. Spatiotemporal CE fingerprints produce more stable D&A results, with smoother dependence on time. Spatial resolution (within the range of a fewspherical harmonics) is less relevant.We argue that especially for early detectability, climate predictions (with proper initialization from observations) are more promising. Many details depend on the choice of climate model for observation and fingerprint. We discuss the potential and limitation of using multimodel ensembles.},

However, more research is needed, as there are significant uncertainties surrounding the possible impacts of SCI, including unforeseen effects on regional climate patterns. In this study, we consider a climate model simulation of the deployment of stratospheric aerosols to maintain the global mean surface temperature at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (ARISE-SAI-1.5). Leveraging two different machine learning methods, we evaluate when the effects of SCI would be detectable at regional scales. Specifically, we train a logistic regression model to classify whether an annual mean map of near-surface temperature or total precipitation is from future climate change under the influence of SCI or not. We then design an artificial neural network to predict how many years it has been since the deployment of SCI by inputting the regional maps from the climate intervention scenario. In both detection methods, we use feature attribution methods to spatially understand the forced climate patterns that are important for the machine learning model predictions. The differences in regional temperature signals are detectable in under a decade for most regions in the SCI scenario compared to greenhouse gas warming. However, the influence of SCI on regional precipitation patterns is more difficult to distinguish due to the presence of internal climate variability.},

The Cone of Uncertainty (COU) is a commonly used visualization, but the graphic is prone to misinterpretation such as thinking only locations contained within the cone’s boundary are at risk. In this study, we investigated the utility of conveying hurricane forecast tracks using a set of animated icons, each representing an instance of a possible storm path. We refer to this new visualization as Animated Risk Trajectories (ARTs). We measured non-experts’ perception of risk when viewing simplified, hypothetical hurricane forecasts presented as ARTs or COUs. To measure perception of risk for each visualization type, we designed experiments to have participants make decisions to evacuate individual towns at varying distances from the most likely forecast path of a storm. The ARTs led to greater risk perception in areas that fell beyond the cone’s boundaries. Non-experts’ interpretation of risk was impacted by the visual properties of the ARTs, such as the distribution of the icons, including their density and whether the distribution was unimodal or bimodal. This supports the suggestion that ARTs can have value in communicating spatial-temporal uncertainty.},

   abstract = {Single model initial-condition large ensembles (LEs) are a useful approach to understand roles of forced responses and internal variability in historical and future climate change. Here, we produce one of the largest ensembles thus far using the MIROC6 coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate model (MIROC6-LE). The total experimental period of MIROC6-LE is longer than 76000 years. MIROC6-LE consists of a long preindustrial control run, 50-member historical simulations, 8 single forcing historical experiments with 10 or 50 members, 5 future scenario experiments with 50 members and 3 single 15 forcing future experiments with 50 members. Here, we describe the experimental design. The output data of most of the experiments are freely available to the public. This dataset would be useful to a wide range of research communities. We also demonstrate some examples of initial analyses. Specifically, we confirm that the linear additivity of the forcing-response relationship holds for the 1850-2020 trends of the annual mean values and extreme indices of surface air temperature and precipitation by analyzing historical fully forced runs and the sum of single forced historical runs. To isolate historical 20 anthropogenic signals of annual mean and extreme temperature for 2000-2020 relative to 1850-1900, ensemble sizes of 4 and 15, respectively, are sufficient in most of the world. Historical anthropogenic signals of annual mean and extreme precipitation are significant with the 50-member ensembles in 76% and 69% of the world, respectively. Fourteen members are sufficient to examine differences in changes in annual mean values and extreme indices of temperature and precipitation between the shared socioeconomic pathways (ssp), ssp585 and ssp126, in most of the world. Ensembles larger than 50 members are desirable for 25 investigations of differences in annual mean and extreme precipitation changes between ssp126 and ssp119. Historical and future changes in internal variability, represented by departures from the ensemble mean, are analyzed with a focus on the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and global annual mean temperature and precipitation. An ensemble size of 31 is large enough to detect ENSO intensification from preindustrial conditions to 1951-2000, from 1951-2000 to 2051-2100 in all future experiments, and from low-to high-emission future scenario experiments. The single forcing historical 30 experiments with 27 members can isolate ENSO intensification due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings. Future changes in the global mean temperature variability are discernible with 23 members under all future experiments, while 50 members are not sufficient for detecting changes in the global mean precipitation variability in ssp119 and ssp126. We also confirm that these temperature and precipitation variabilities are not precisely analyzed when detrended anomalies from the long-term averages are used due to interannual climate responses to the historical natural forcing, which highlights the 35 importance of large ensembles for assessing internal variability.},

   abstract = {Tropical cyclones (TCs) are a hazard to life and property and a prominent element of the global climate system; therefore, understanding and predicting TC location, intensity, and frequency is of both societal and scientific significance. Methodologies exist to predict basinwide, seasonally aggregated TC activity months, seasons, and even years in advance. It is shown that a newly developed high-resolution global climate model can produce skillful forecasts of seasonal TC activity on spatial scales finer than basinwide, from months and seasons in advance of the TC season. The climate model used here is targeted at predicting regional climate and the statistics of weather extremes on seasonal to decadal time scales, and comprises high-resolution (50km × 50 km) atmosphere and land components as well as more moderate-resolution(∼100 km) sea ice and ocean components. The simulation of TC climatology and interannual variations in this climate model is substantially improved by correcting systematic ocean biases through "flux adjustment."Asuite of 12-month duration retrospective forecasts is performed over the 1981-2012 period, after initializing the climate model to observationally constrained conditions at the start of each forecast period, using both the standard and fluxadjusted versions of the model. The standard and flux-adjusted forecasts exhibit equivalent skill at predicting Northern Hemisphere TC season sea surface temperature, but the flux-adjusted model exhibits substantially improved basinwide and regional TC activity forecasts, highlighting the role of systematic biases in limiting the quality of TC forecasts. These results suggest that dynamical forecasts of seasonally aggregated regional TC activity months in advance are feasible.},

The first improvement is to the input data, which now include additional station networks, quality assurance reviews, and temperature bias adjustments. The second improvement is to the suite of climatic elements, which now includes both maximum and minimum temperatures. The third improvement is to the computational approach, which now employs climatologically aided interpolation to address topographic and network variability. Version 2 exhibits substantial differences from version 1 over the period 1895-2012. For example, divisional averages in version 2 tend to be cooler and wetter, particularly in mountainous areas of the western United States. Division-level trends in temperature and precipitation display greater spatial consistency in version 2. National-scale temperature trends in version 2 are comparable to those in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network whereas version 1 exhibits less warming as a result of historical changes in observing practices. Divisional errors in version 2 are likely less than 0.58C for temperature and 20mmfor precipitation at the start of the record, falling rapidly thereafter. Overall, these results indicate that version 2 can supersede version 1 in both operational climate monitoring and applied climatic research. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

The QA procedures are being applied operationally to the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)-Daily dataset. Since these data are used for analyzing and monitoring variations in extremes, the QA system is designed to detect as many errors as possible while maintaining a low probability of falsely identifying true meteorological events as erroneous. The system consists of 19 carefully evaluated tests that detect duplicate data, climatological outliers, and various inconsistencies (internal, temporal, and spatial). Manual review of random samples of the values flagged as errors is used to set the threshold for each procedure such that its falsepositive rate, or fraction of valid values identified as errors, is minimized. In addition, the tests are arranged in a deliberate sequence in which the performance of the later checks is enhanced by the error detection capabilities of the earlier tests. Based on an assessment of each individual check and a final evaluation for each element, the system identifies 3.6 million (0.24%) of the more than 1.5 billion maximum/minimum temperature, precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth values in GHCN-Daily as errors, has a false-positive rate of 1%-2%, and is effective at detecting both the grossest errors as well as more subtle inconsistencies among elements. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {An automated homogenization algorithm based on the pairwise comparison of monthly temperature series is described. The algorithm works by forming pairwise difference series between serial monthly temperature values from a network of observing stations. Each difference series is then evaluated for undocumented shifts, and the station series responsible for such breaks is identified automatically. The algorithm also makes use of station history information, when available, to improve the identification of artificial shifts in temperature data. In addition, an evaluation is carried out to distinguish trend inhomogeneities from abrupt shifts. When the magnitude of an apparent shift attributed to a particular station can be reliably estimated, an adjustment is made for the target series. The pairwise algorithm is shown to be robust and efficient at detecting undocumented step changes under a variety of simulated scenarios with step- and trend-type inhomogeneities. Moreover, the approach is shown to yield a lower false-alarm rate for undocumented changepoint detection relative to the more common use of a reference series. Results from the algorithm are used to assess evidence for trend inhomogeneities in U.S. monthly temperature data.},

Quality assurance checks are routinely applied to the full dataset, but the data are not homogenized to account for artifacts associated with the various eras in reporting practice at any particular station (i.e., for changes in systematic bias). Daily updates are provided for many of the station records in GHCN-Daily. The dataset is also regularly reconstructed, usually once per week, from its 201 data source components, ensuring that the dataset is broadly synchronized with its growing list of constituent sources. The daily updates and weekly reprocessed versions of GHCN-Daily are assigned a unique version number, and the most recent dataset version is provided on the GHCN-Daily website for free public access. Each version of the dataset is also archived at the NOAA/National Climatic Data Center in perpetuity for future retrieval.},

   abstract = {The analysis produced by the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) may be dynamically inconsistent and contain unbalanced gravity waves that are absent in the real atmosphere. These imbalances can be exacerbated by covariance localization and inflation. One strategy to combat the imbalance in the analyses is the incremental analysis update (IAU), which uses the dynamic model to distribute the analyses increments over a time window. The IAU has been widely used in atmospheric and oceanic applications. However, the analysis increment that is gradually introduced during a model integration is often computed once and assumed to be constant for an assimilation window, which can be seen as a three-dimensional IAU (3DIAU). Thus, the propagation of the analysis increment in the assimilation window is neglected, yet this propagation may be important, especially for moving weather systems. To take into account the propagation of the analysis increment during an assimilation window, a four-dimensional IAU (4DIAU) used with the EnKF is presented. It constructs time-varying analysis increments by applying all observations in an assimilation window to state variables at different times during the assimilation window. It then gradually applies these time-varying analysis increments through the assimilation window. Results from a dry two-layer primitive equation model and the NCEP GFS show that EnKF with 4DIAU (EnKF-4DIAU) and 3DIAU (EnKF-3DIAU) reduce imbalances in the analysis compared to EnKF without initialization (EnKF-RAW). EnKF-4DIAU retains the time-varying information in the analysis increments better than EnKF-3DIAU, and produces better analysis and forecast than either EnKF-RAW or EnKF-3DIAU.},

   abstract = {State-of-the-art homogenisation approaches for any test site rely upon the availability of a sufficient number of neighbouring sites with similar climatic conditions and a sufficient quantity of overlapping measurements. These conditions are not always met, particularly in poorly sampled regions and epochs. Modern sparse-input reanalysis products which are constrained by observed sea surface temperatures, sea-ice and surface pressure observations, continue to improve, offering independently produced surface temperature estimates back to the early 19th century. This study undertakes an exploratory analysis on the applicability of sparse-input reanalysis to identify breakpoints in available basic station data. Adjustments are then applied using a variety of reanalysis and neighbour-based approaches to produce four distinct estimates. The methodological independence of the approach may offer valuable insights into historical data quality issues. The resulting estimates are compared to Global Historical Climatology Network version 4 (GHCNMv4) at various aggregations. Comparisons are also made with five existing global land surface monthly time series. We find a lower rate of long-term warming which principally arises in differences in estimated behaviour prior to the early 20th century. Differences depend upon the exact pair of estimates, varying between 15 and 40% for changes from 1850–1900 to 2005–2014. Differences are much smaller for metrics starting after 1900 and negligible after 1950. Initial efforts at quantifying parametric uncertainty suggest this would be substantial and may lead to overlap between these new estimates and existing estimates. Further work would be required to use these data products in an operational context. This would include better understanding the reasons for apparent early period divergence including the impact of spatial infilling choices, quantification of parametric uncertainty, and a means to update the product post-2015 when the NOAA-CIRES-DOE 20CRv3 sparse input reanalysis product, upon which they are based, presently ceases.},

   abstract = {The formulation and simulation characteristics of two new global coupled climate models developed at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) are described. The models were designed to simulate atmospheric and oceanic climate and variability from the diurnal time scale through multicentury climate change, given our computational constraints. In particular, an important goal was to use the same model for both experimental seasonal to interannual forecasting and the study of multicentury global climate change, and this goal has been achieved. Tw o versions of the coupled model are described, called CM2.0 and CM2.1. The versions differ primarily in the dynamical core used in the atmospheric component, along with the cloud tuning and some details of the land and ocean components. For both coupled models, the resolution of the land and atmospheric components is 2° latitude × 2.5° longitude; the atmospheric model has 24 vertical levels. The ocean resolution is 1° in latitude and longitude, with meridional resolution equatorward of 30° becoming progressively finer, such that the meridional resolution is 1/3° at the equator. There are 50 vertical levels in the ocean, with 22 evenly spaced levels within the top 220 m. The ocean component has poles over North America and Eurasia to avoid polar filtering. Neither coupled model employs flux adjustments. The co ntrol simulations have stable, realistic climates when integrated over multiple centuries. Both models have simulations of ENSO that are substantially improved relative to previous GFDL coupled models. The CM2.0 model has been further evaluated as an ENSO forecast model and has good skill (CM2.1 has not been evaluated as an ENSO forecast model). Generally reduced temperature and salinity biases exist in CM2.1 relative to CM2.0. These reductions are associated with 1) improved simulations of surface wind stress in CM2.1 and associated changes in oceanic gyre circulations; 2) changes in cloud tuning and the land model, both of which act to increase the net surface shortwave radiation in CM2.1, thereby reducing an overall cold bias present in CM2.0; and 3) a reduction of ocean lateral viscosity in the extratropics in CM2.1, which reduces sea ice biases in the North Atlantic. Both models have be en used to conduct a suite of climate change simulations for the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report and are able to simulate the main features of the observed warming of the twentieth century. The climate sensitivities of the CM2.0 and CM2.1 models are 2.9 and 3.4 K, respectively. These sensitivities are defined by coupling the atmospheric components of CM2.0 and CM2.1 to a slab ocean model and allowing the model to come into equilibrium with a doubling of atmospheric CO2. The output from a suite of integrations conducted with these models is freely available online (see http://nomads.gfdl.noaa.gov/). © 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {LM3 is a new model of terrestrial water, energy, and carbon, intended for use in global hydrologic analyses and as a component of earth-system and physical-climate models. It is designed to improve upon the performance and to extend the scope of the predecessor Land Dynamics (LaD) and LM3V models by better quantifying the physical controls of climate and biogeochemistry and by relating more directly to components of the globalwater systemthat touch human concerns.LM3 includesmultilayer representations of temperature, liquid water content, and ice content of both snowpack andmacroporous soil-bedrock; topography-based description of saturated area and groundwater discharge and transport of runoff to the ocean via a global river and lake network. Sensible heat transport by watermass is accounted throughout for a complete energy balance. Carbon and vegetation dynamics and biophysics are represented as in LM3V. In numerical experiments, LM3 avoids some of the limitations of the LaD model and provides qualitatively (though not always quantitatively) reasonable estimates, from a global perspective, of observed spatial and/or temporal variations of vegetation density, albedo, streamflow, water-table depth, permafrost, and lake levels. Amplitude and phase of annual cycle of total water storage are simulated well. Realism of modeled lake levels varies widely. The water table tends to be consistently too shallow in humid regions. Biophysical properties have an artificial stepwise spatial structure, and equilibrium vegetation is sensitive to initial conditions. Explicit resolution of thick (>100m) unsaturated zones and permafrost is possible, but only at the cost of long (≫300 yr) model spinup times.},

The atmosphere model, known as AM2, includes a new gridpoint dynamical core, a prognostic cloud scheme, and a multispecies aerosol climatology, as well as components from previous models used at GFDL. The land model, known as LM2, includes soil sensible and latent heat storage, groundwater storage, and stomatal resistance. The performance of the coupled model AM2-LM2 is evaluated with a series of prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) simulations. Particular focus is given to the model's climatology and the characteristics of interannual variability related to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). One AM2-LM2 integration was perfor med according to the prescriptions of the second Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP II) and data were submitted to the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI). Particular strengths of AM2-LM2, as judged by comparison to other models participating in AMIP II, include its circulation and distributions of precipitation. Prominent problems of AM2-LM2 include a cold bias to surface and tropospheric temperatures, weak tropical cyclone activity, and weak tropical intraseasonal activity associated with the Madden-Julian oscillation. An ensemble of 10 AM2-LM 2 integrations with observed SSTs for the second half of the twentieth century permits a statistically reliable assessment of the model's response to ENSO. In general, AM2-LM2 produces a realistic simulation of the anomalies in tropical precipitation and extratropical circulation that are associated with ENSO. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.},

This paper summarizes the new physical features of the models and examines the simulations that they produce. Of the two new coupled climate model versions 2.1 (CM2.1) and 2.0 (CM2.0), the CM2.1 model represents a major improvement over CM2.0 in most of the major oceanic features examined, with strikingly lower drifts in hydrographic fields such as temperature and salinity, more realistic ventilation of the deep ocean, and currents that are closer to their observed values. Regional analysis of the differences between the models highlights the importance of wind stress in determining the circulation, particularly in the Southern Ocean.

   abstract = {The sixth version of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC), called MIROC6, was cooperatively developed by a Japanese modeling community. In the present paper, simulated mean climate, internal climate variability, and climate sensitivity in MIROC6 are evaluated and briefly summarized in comparison with the previous version of our climate model (MIROC5) and observations. The results show that the overall reproducibility of mean climate and internal climate variability in MIROC6 is better than that in MIROC5. The tropical climate systems (e.g., summertime precipitation in the western Pacific and the eastward-propagating Madden-Julian oscillation) and the midlatitude atmospheric circulation (e.g., the westerlies, the polar night jet, and troposphere-stratosphere interactions) are significantly improved in MIROC6. These improvements can be attributed to the newly implemented parameterization for shallow convective processes and to the inclusion of the stratosphere. While there are significant differences in climates and variabilities between the two models, the effective climate sensitivity of 2.6K remains the same because the differences in radiative forcing and climate feedback tend to offset each other. With an aim towards contributing to the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, designated simulations tackling a wide range of climate science issues, as well as seasonal to decadal climate predictions and future climate projections, are currently ongoing using MIROC6.},

The model is built with the AM4.0/LM4.0 atmosphere/land model and OM4.0 ocean model. Topics include the rationale for key choices made in the model formulation, the stability as well as drift of the preindustrial control simulation, and comparison of key aspects of the historical simulations with observations from recent decades. Notable achievements include the relatively small biases in seasonal spatial patterns of top-of-atmosphere fluxes, surface temperature, and precipitation; reduced double Intertropical Convergence Zone bias; dramatically improved representation of ocean boundary currents; a high-quality simulation of climatological Arctic sea ice extent and its recent decline; and excellent simulation of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation spectrum and structure. Areas of concern include inadequate deep convection in the Nordic Seas; an inaccurate Antarctic sea ice simulation; precipitation and wind composites still affected by the equatorial cold tongue bias; muted variability in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation; strong 100 year quasiperiodicity in Southern Ocean ventilation; and a lack of historical warming before 1990 and too rapid warming thereafter due to high climate sensitivity and strong aerosol forcing, in contrast to the observational record. Overall, CM4.0 scores very well in its fidelity against observations compared to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 generation in terms of both mean state and modes of variability and should prove a valuable new addition for analysis across a broad array of applications.},

OM4 serves as the ocean/sea ice component for the GFDL climate and Earth system models. It is also used for climate science research and is contributing to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 Ocean Model Intercomparison Project. The ocean component of OM4 uses version 6 of the Modular Ocean Model and the sea ice component uses version 2 of the Sea Ice Simulator, which have identical horizontal grid layouts (Arakawa C-grid). We follow the Coordinated Ocean-sea ice Reference Experiments protocol to assess simulation quality across a broad suite of climate-relevant features. We present results from two versions differing by horizontal grid spacing and physical parameterizations: OM4p5 has nominal 0.5° spacing and includes mesoscale eddy parameterizations and OM4p25 has nominal 0.25° spacing with no mesoscale eddy parameterization. Modular Ocean Model version 6 makes use of a vertical Lagrangian-remap algorithm that enables general vertical coordinates. We show that use of a hybrid depth-isopycnal coordinate reduces the middepth ocean warming drift commonly found in pure z* vertical coordinate ocean models. To test the need for the mesoscale eddy parameterization used in OM4p5, we examine the results from a simulation that removes the eddy parameterization. The water mass structure and model drift are physically degraded relative to OM4p5, thus supporting the key role for a mesoscale closure at this resolution.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a set of energy and resource intensive scenarios based on the concept of Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs). The scenario family is characterized by rapid and fossil-fueled development with high socio-economic challenges to mitigation and low socio-economic challenges to adaptation (SSP5). A special focus is placed on the SSP5 marker scenario developed by the REMIND-MAgPIE integrated assessment modeling framework. The SSP5 baseline scenarios exhibit very high levels of fossil fuel use, up to a doubling of global food demand, and up to a tripling of energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions over the course of the century, marking the upper end of the scenario literature in several dimensions. These scenarios are currently the only SSP scenarios that result in a radiative forcing pathway as high as the highest Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5). This paper further investigates the direct impact of mitigation policies on the SSP5 energy, land and emissions dynamics confirming high socio-economic challenges to mitigation in SSP5. Nonetheless, mitigation policies reaching climate forcing levels as low as in the lowest Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP2.6) are accessible in SSP5. The SSP5 scenarios presented in this paper aim to provide useful reference points for future climate change, climate impact, adaption and mitigation analysis, and broader questions of sustainable development.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 °C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

   abstract = {The Mediterranean region has been identified as a climate hot spot, with models projecting a robust warming and rainfall decline in response to increasing greenhouse gases. The projected rainfall decline would have impacts on agriculture and water resources. Can such changes be reversed with significant reductions in greenhouse gases? To explore this, we examine large ensembles of a high-resolution climate model with various future radiative forcing scenarios, including a scenario with substantial reductions in greenhouse gas concentrations beginning in the mid-21st century. In response to greenhouse gas reductions, the Mediterranean summer rainfall decline is reversed, but the winter rainfall decline continues. This continued winter rainfall decline results from a persistent atmospheric anticyclone over the western Mediterranean. Using additional numerical experiments, we show that the anticyclone and continued winter rainfall decline are attributable to greenhouse gas–induced weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) that continues throughout the 21st century. The persistently weak AMOC, in concert with greenhouse gas reductions, leads to rapid cooling and sea ice growth in the subpolar North Atlantic. This cooling leads to a strong cyclonic atmospheric circulation anomaly over the North Atlantic subpolar gyre and, via atmospheric teleconnections, to the anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the Mediterranean. The failure to reverse the winter rainfall decline, despite substantial climate change mitigation, is an example of a “surprise” in the climate system. In this case, a persistent AMOC change unexpectedly impedes the reversibility of Mediterranean climate change. Such surprises could complicate pathways toward full climate recovery.},

Using a statistical optimization method, the average predictability time, we identify three large-scale components of the frequency of North American summer heat extremes that are predictable with significant correlation skill. One component, which is related to a secular warming trend, shows a continent-wide increase in the frequency of summer heat extremes and is highly predictable at least 9 months in advance. This trend component is likely a response to external radiative forcing. The second component is largely driven by the sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific and North Atlantic and is significantly correlated with the central U.S. soil moisture. The second component shows largest loadings over the central United States and is significantly predictable 9 months in advance. The third component, which is related to the central Pacific El Niño, displays a dipole structure over North America and is predictable up to 4 months in advance.

   abstract = {The rapid day-to-day temperature swings associated with extratropical storm tracks can cause cascading infrastructure failure and impact human outdoor activities, thus research on seasonal prediction and predictability of extreme temperature swings is of huge societal importance. To measure the extreme surface air temperature (SAT) variations associated with the winter extratropical storm tracks, a Temperature Swing Index (TSI) is formulated as the standard deviation of 24-h-difference-filtered data of the 6-hourly SAT. The dominant term governing the TSI variability is shown to be proportional to the product of eddy heat flux and mean temperature gradient. The seasonal prediction skill of the winter TSI over North America was assessed using Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's new seasonal prediction system. The locations with skillful TSI prediction show a geographic pattern that is distinct from the pattern of skillful seasonal mean SAT prediction. The prediction of TSI provides additional predictable climate information beyond the traditional seasonal mean temperature prediction. The source of the seasonal TSI prediction can be attributed to year-to-year variations of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), and Pacific/North American (PNA) teleconnection. Over the central United States, the correlation skill of TSI prediction reaches 0.75 with strong links to observed ENSO, NPO, and PNA, while the skill of seasonal SAT prediction is relatively low with a correlation of 0.36. As a first attempt of diagnosing the combined predictability of the first-order (the seasonal mean) and second-order (TSI) statistics for SAT, this study highlights the importance of the eddy-mean flow interaction perspective for understanding the seasonal climate predictability in the extra tropics. These results point toward providing skillful prediction of higher-order statistical information related to winter temperature extremes, thus enriching the seasonal forecast products for the research community and decision makers.},

   abstract = {This paper summarizes the main characteristics of the RCP8.5 scenario. The RCP8.5 combines assumptions about high population and relatively slow income growth with modest rates of technological change and energy intensity improvements, leading in the long term to high energy demand and GHG emissions in absence of climate change policies. Compared to the total set of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP8.5 thus corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Using the IIASA Integrated Assessment Framework and the MESSAGE model for the development of the RCP8.5, we focus in this paper on two important extensions compared to earlier scenarios: 1) the development of spatially explicit air pollution projections, and 2) enhancements in the land-use and land-cover change projections. In addition, we explore scenario variants that use RCP8.5 as a baseline, and assume different degrees of greenhouse gas mitigation policies to reduce radiative forcing. Based on our modeling framework, we find it technically possible to limit forcing from RCP8.5 to lower levels comparable to the other RCPs (2.6 to 6 W/m2). Our scenario analysis further indicates that climate policy-induced changes of global energy supply and demand may lead to significant co-benefits for other policy priorities, such as local air pollution. © 2011 The Author(s).},

The warming hole emerges after a regime shift in 1958 where annual maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures decreased by 0.83°C and 0.46°C, respectively. The annual warming hole consists of two distinct seasonal modes, one located in the southeastern United States during winter and spring and the other in the midwestern United States during summer and autumn. A correlation analysis indicates that the seasonal modes differ in causation. Winter temperatures in the warming hole are significantly correlated with the Meridional Circulation Index, North Atlantic Oscillation, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. However, the variability of ocean-atmosphere circulation modes is insufficient to explain the summer temperature patterns of the warming hole.},

While many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required to become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to perception that machine learning methods are “black boxes” and thus end-users are hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their everyday workflow. To reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy toward machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some of the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example is used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing machine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning methods are demonstrated: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosted decision trees, naïve Bayes, and support vector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also contains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best practices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets. Furthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory notebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to catalyze the use of machine learning in meteorology.},

the often missing ground truth explanations complicate their evaluation and
validation, subsequently compounding the choice of the XAI method. Therefore,
in this work, we introduce XAI evaluation in the context of climate research
and assess different desired explanation properties, namely, robustness,
faithfulness, randomization, complexity, and localization. To this end we build
upon previous work and train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a convolutional
neural network (CNN) to predict the decade based on annual-mean temperature
maps. Next, multiple local XAI methods are applied and their performance is
quantified for each evaluation property and compared against a baseline test.
Independent of the network type, we find that the XAI methods Integrated
Gradients, Layer-wise relevance propagation, and InputGradients exhibit
considerable robustness, faithfulness, and complexity while sacrificing
randomization. The opposite is true for Gradient, SmoothGrad, NoiseGrad, and
FusionGrad. Notably, explanations using input perturbations, such as SmoothGrad
and Integrated Gradients, do not improve robustness and faithfulness, contrary
to previous claims. Overall, our experiments offer a comprehensive overview of
different properties of explanation methods in the climate science context and

   abstract = {Leveraging artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on climate model output, we use the spatial pattern of historical temperature observations to predict the time until critical global warming thresholds are reached. Although no observations are used during the training, validation, or testing, the ANNs accurately predict the timing of historical global warming from maps of historical annual temperature. The central estimate for the 1.5 °C global warming threshold is between 2033 and 2035, including a ±1σ range of 2028 to 2039 in the Intermediate (SSP2-4.5) climate forcing scenario, consistent with previous assessments. However, our data-driven approach also suggests a substantial probability of exceeding the 2 °C threshold even in the Low (SSP1-2.6) climate forcing scenario. While there are limitations to our approach, our results suggest a higher likelihood of reaching 2 °C in the Low scenario than indicated in some previous assessments—though the possibility that 2 °C could be avoided is not ruled out. Explainable AI methods reveal that the ANNs focus on particular geographic regions to predict the time until the global threshold is reached. Our framework provides a unique, data-driven approach for quantifying the signal of climate change in historical observations and for constraining the uncertainty in climate model projections. Given the substantial existing evidence of accelerating risks to natural and human systems at 1.5 °C and 2 °C, our results provide further evidence for high-impact climate change over the next three decades.},

Here, we discuss our “lesson learned” that the task of attributing a prediction to the input does not have a single solution. Instead, the attribution results depend greatly on the considered baseline that the XAI method utilizes—a fact that has been overlooked in the geoscientific literature. The baseline is a reference point to which the prediction is compared so that the prediction can be understood. This baseline can be chosen by the user or is set by construction in the method’s algorithm—often without the user being aware of that choice. We highlight that different baselines can lead to different insights for different science questions and, thus, should be chosen accordingly. To illustrate the impact of the baseline, we use a large ensemble of historical and future climate simulations forced with the shared socioeconomic pathway 3-7.0 (SSP3-7.0) scenario and train a fully connected NN to predict the ensemble- and global-mean temperature (i.e., the forced global warming signal) given an annual temperature map from an individual ensemble member. We then use various XAI methods and different baselines to attribute the network predictions to the input. We show that attributions differ substantially when considering different baselines, because they correspond to answering different science questions. We conclude by discussing important implications and considerations about the use of baselines in XAI research.},

   abstract = {Unusually hot summer conditions occurred during the 1930s over the central United States and undoubtedly contributed to the severity of the Dust Bowl drought. We investigate local and large-scale conditions in association with the extraordinary heat and drought events, making use of novel datasets of observed climate extremes and climate reanalysis covering the past century. We show that the unprecedented summer heat during the Dust Bowl years was likely exacerbated by land-surface feedbacks associated with springtime precipitation deficits. The reanalysis results indicate that these deficits were associated with the coincidence of anomalously warm North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific surface waters and a shift in atmospheric pressure patterns leading to reduced flow of moist air into the central US. Thus, the combination of springtime ocean temperatures and atmospheric flow anomalies, leading to reduced precipitation, also holds potential for enhanced predictability of summer heat events. The results suggest that hot drought, more severe than experienced during the most recent 2011 and 2012 heat waves, is to be expected when ocean temperature anomalies like those observed in the 1930s occur in a world that has seen significant mean warming.},

   abstract = {Ecological and societal disruptions by modern climate change are critically determined by the time frame over which climates shift beyond historical analogues. Here we present a new index of the year when the projected mean climate of a given location moves to a state continuously outside the bounds of historical variability under alternative greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Using 1860 to 2005 as the historical period, this index has a global mean of 2069 (±18 years s.d.) for near-surface air temperature under an emissions stabilization scenario and 2047 (±14 years s.d.) under a ‘business-as-usual’ scenario. Unprecedented climates will occur earliest in the tropics and among low-income countries, highlighting the vulnerability of global biodiversity and the limited governmental capacity to respond to the impacts of climate change. Our findings shed light on the urgency of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions if climates potentially harmful to biodiversity and society are to be prevented. An ensemble of simulations indicates that ongoing climate change will exceed the bounds of historical climate variability some time in the mid to late twenty-first century and that the burden of rapid climate adaption will occur earliest in highly biodiverse and often economically challenged tropical areas. Projections of warming are now a fixture of climate modelling exercises. Camilo Mora et al. have used an ensemble of these simulations to estimate when ongoing warming will exceed the bounds of historical climate variability. Depending on assumptions regarding future emissions in greenhouse gasses, this will occur sometime in the mid to late twenty-first century. This landmark event is likely to occur first in the tropics, where historical variability is low, and where biodiversity is highest. The new projections suggest that the often economically challenged areas in the tropics will face the highest burden of rapidly adapting to the biological effects of climate change. In an accompanying News &amp; Views Forum, three climatologists discuss the significance of these results.},

   abstract = {We investigate a new approach to quantify the time of emergence of climate change using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The basic idea is to use artificial intelligence methods to predict, given a global (or regional) temperature map averaged over a particular year, the year to which the temperature map belongs. We use NCAR's CESM model data from 1920 to 2100 for that purpose. We expected that the ANN prediction model would perform badly for early years (due to large internal variability), and that accuracy would improve drastically in the 21st century when climate change creates a strong, dominant signal, which may then indicate a time of emergence. Performing this prediction experiment for three different regions, namely the entire globe, the US, and a central region of the US, yielded very interesting first results, which are presented and discussed here. I. INTRO The time of emergence (ToE) of climate change is defined as the time at which the signal of climate change clearly stands out over the noise of natural climate variability, making it an important quantity for climate projections, risk assessments and policy decisions. Many different ideas have emerged of how to define and quantify ToE [1], most of which are based on strictly statistical analyses. Examples include using a particular signal-to-noise ratio cutoff [2], applying the t-statistic or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to test for significant differences between time periods [3], [4], or utilizing the standard error of the regression to estimate the lead-time required for a linear trend to emerge from natural variability [5]. Motivated by recent advances in using artificial intelligence (AI) to autonomously detect complex patterns in many different settings (ranging from face recognition to detection of extreme weather events [6], [7]), we propose a very different approach to defining the ToE of climate change. Specifically, we ask the following two questions, "In which year does climate change become apparent to an AI?" and "Which spatial patterns are detected as dominant signatures of this climate change signal?" To address these questions we train several artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the year corresponding to an annual-mean temperature field taken from a climate model simulation, specifically from 35 ensemble members of NCAR's CESM-LE model. These 35 simulations are all runs from the same model (the CESM model) under identical forcings for 1920-2100. The only difference between ensemble members is that each is started with slightly different initial conditions, and these tiny differences lead to large differences in internal climate variability , or climate "noise". Thus, one can think of each ensemble member as one possible evolution of earth's climate, and in this context, the observed evolution of earth's climate as yet another ensemble member. Due to this experimental setup, the climates of all ensemble members evolve independently from one another except for their similarities in the forcings imposed (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions). Thus, the AI is trained to distinguish the climate change signal (in the form of predicting the year) from that of background climate noise. II. DATA We use annual-mean global surface temperature data from 35 ensemble members of the Community Earth System Model-Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) model developed by NCAR [8]. The model is run under identical forcings (RCP 8.5) from 1920-2100, providing 181 × 35 = 6, 335 annual temperature maps, representing 181 different years. The resulting maps have a resolution of 0.94 o in latitude and 1.25 o in longitude. We reduce the resolution by a factor of 5 in both latitude and longitude, by averaging temperature values over disjoint 5x5 groups of grid points. The resulting maps have a coarse resolution of 4.71 o in lat and 6.25 o in longitude. Each map is "labeled" with its year.},

   abstract = {As anthropogenic climate change continues the risks to biodiversity will increase over time, with future projections indicating that a potentially catastrophic loss of global biodiversity is on the horizon1–3. However, our understanding of when and how abruptly this climate-driven disruption of biodiversity will occur is limited because biodiversity forecasts typically focus on individual snapshots of the future. Here we use annual projections (from 1850 to 2100) of temperature and precipitation across the ranges of more than 30,000 marine and terrestrial species to estimate the timing of their exposure to potentially dangerous climate conditions. We project that future disruption of ecological assemblages as a result of climate change will be abrupt, because within any given ecological assemblage the exposure of most species to climate conditions beyond their realized niche limits occurs almost simultaneously. Under a high-emissions scenario (representative concentration pathway (RCP)&nbsp;8.5), such abrupt exposure events begin before 2030 in tropical oceans and spread to tropical forests and higher latitudes by 2050. If global warming is kept below 2 °C, less than 2% of assemblages globally are projected to undergo abrupt exposure events of more than 20% of their constituent species; however, the risk accelerates with the magnitude of warming, threatening 15% of assemblages at 4 °C, with similar levels of risk in protected and unprotected areas. These results highlight the impending risk of sudden and severe biodiversity losses from climate change and provide a framework for predicting both when and where these events may occur. Using annual projections of temperature and precipitation to estimate when species will be exposed to potentially harmful climate conditions reveals that disruption of ecological assemblages as a result of climate change will be abrupt and could start as early as the current decade.},

   abstract = {Climate change is expected to modify ecological responses in the ocean, with the potential for important effects on the ecosystem services provided to humankind. Here we address the question of how rapidly multiple drivers of marine ecosystem change develop in the future ocean. By analysing an ensemble of models we find that, within the next 15 years, the climate change-driven trends in multiple ecosystem drivers emerge from the background of natural variability in 55% of the ocean and propagate rapidly to encompass 86% of the ocean by 2050 under a ‘business-as-usual’ scenario. However, we also demonstrate that the exposure of marine ecosystems to climate change-induced stress can be drastically reduced via climate mitigation measures; with mitigation, the proportion of ocean susceptible to multiple drivers within the next 15 years is reduced to 34%. Mitigation slows the pace at which multiple drivers emerge, allowing an additional 20 years for adaptation in marine ecological and socio-economic systems alike. Climate change is expected to alter ocean ecology, and to potentially impact the ecosystem services provided to humankind. Here, the authors address how rapidly multiple factors that affect marine ecosystems are likely to develop in the future ocean and the remedial effects climate mitigation might have.},

   abstract = {There are large uncertainties associated with the projection of climate extremes. This study shows that the uncertainties are mainly due to internal climate variability. However, model projections are consistent when averaged across regions, allowing robust projection of future extremes. Many climatic extremes are changing1,2,3,4,5, and decision-makers express a strong need for reliable information on further changes over the coming decades as a basis for adaptation strategies. Here, we demonstrate that for extremes stakeholders will have to deal with large irreducible uncertainties on local to regional scales as a result of internal variability, even if climate models improve rapidly. A multimember initial condition ensemble carried out with an Earth system model shows that trends towards more intense hot and less intense cold extremes may be masked or even reversed locally for the coming three to five decades even if greenhouse gas emissions rapidly increase. Likewise, despite a long-term trend towards more intense precipitation and longer dry spells, multidecadal trends of opposite sign cannot be excluded over many land points. However, extremes may dramatically change at a rate much larger than anticipated from the long-term signal. Despite these large irreducible uncertainties on the local scale, projections are remarkably consistent from an aggregated spatial probability perspective. Models agree that within only three decades about half of the land fraction will see significantly more intense hot extremes. We show that even in the short term the land fraction experiencing more intense precipitation events is larger than expected from internal variability. The proposed perspective yields valuable information for decision-makers and stakeholders at the international level.},

Here, we present the most up-to-date assessment of climate change impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems, and ecosystem services in the U.S. and implications for natural resource management. We draw from the 4th National Climate Assessment to summarize observed and projected changes to ecosystems and biodiversity, explore linkages to important ecosystem services, and discuss associated challenges and opportunities for natural resource management. We find that species are responding to climate change through changes in morphology and behavior, phenology, and geographic range shifts, and these changes are mediated by plastic and evolutionary responses. Responses by species and populations, combined with direct effects of climate change on ecosystems (including more extreme events), are resulting in widespread changes in productivity, species interactions, vulnerability to biological invasions, and other emergent properties. Collectively, these impacts alter the benefits and services that natural ecosystems can provide to society. Although not all impacts are negative, even positive changes can require costly societal adjustments. Natural resource managers need proactive, flexible adaptation strategies that consider historical and future outlooks to minimize costs over the long term. Many organizations are beginning to explore these approaches, but implementation is not yet prevalent or systematic across the nation.},

We compute the ToEI using probabilistic climate change projections and impact functions from three integrated assessment models of climate change: DICE, RICE and CLIMRISK. Our results demonstrate that, in terms of the business-as-usual carbon emissions scenario, the global economy could reach its ToEI by 2095. Regional results highlight areas that are likely to reach the ToEI sooner, namely Western Europe by 2075, India by 2083, and Africa by 2085. We also explore local-scale variations in the ToEI demonstrating that, for example, Paris already reached the ToEI around 2020, while Shanghai will reach it around 2080. We conclude that the ToEI methodology can be applied to impact models of varying scales when sufficient historical impact data are available. Moreover, unprecedented impacts of climate change in the 21st century may be experienced even in economically developed regions in the US and Europe. Finally, moderate to stringent climate change mitigation policies could delay the extreme economic impacts of climate change by three decades in Latin America, the Middle East, and Japan, by two decades in India, Western Europe, and the US, and by one decade in Africa. Our results can be used by policymakers interested in implementing timely climate policies to prevent potentially large economic shocks due to climate change.},

Cascades result from interdependencies between systems and sub-systems of coupled natural and socio-economic systems in response to changes and feedback loops. The combined effects of interacting stressors may affect the ability of individuals, governments, and the private sector to adapt in time, before widespread damage occurs. We discuss the origins of cascading impacts thinking and present the results of an investigation of cascading impacts and implications in New Zealand. A participatory and collaborative approach was used through workshops and semi-structured interviews with sector informants, including engineers, local government staff, and financial risk managers and analysts from the financial services sectors. Qualitative data collection was combined with network and systems analysis to examine increased frequency of high-intensity rainfall events, sea-level rise and drought, across urban water infrastructure and the financial services, and the implications of cascading climate change impacts for governance. Results demonstrate that closer consideration of the combined effects of linked stressors can facilitate a better understanding of the scope and scale of climate change impacts. By using critical systems thinking in characterising and assessing how climate change impacts cascade across domains, we show the implications of cascades for their governance and reveal where climate change adaptation interventions might be focused. The research methods and insights into cascades provide a conceptual and practical basis for further development, which can inform the design of additional studies in other domains and jurisdictions.},

Detecting such changes in ocean biogeochemistry will require quantification of the magnitude of the change (anthropogenic signal) and the natural variability inherent to the climate system (noise). Here we use Large Ensemble (LE) experiments from four Earth system models (ESMs) with multiple emissions scenarios to estimate Time of Emergence (ToE) and partition projection uncertainty for anthropogenic signals in five biogeochemically important upper-ocean variables. We find ToEs are robust across ESMs for sea surface temperature and the invasion of anthropogenic carbon; emergence time scales are 20–30 yr. For the biological carbon pump, and sea surface chlorophyll and salinity, emergence time scales are longer (50+ yr), less robust across the ESMs, and more sensitive to the forcing scenario considered. We find internal variability uncertainty, and model differences in the internal variability uncertainty, can be consequential sources of uncertainty for projecting regional changes in ocean biogeochemistry over the coming decades. In combining structural, scenario, and internal variability uncertainty, this study represents the most comprehensive characterization of biogeochemical emergence time scales and uncertainty to date. Our findings delineate critical spatial and duration requirements for marine observing systems to robustly detect anthropogenic change.},

However, using a spatially aggregated perspective, we demonstrate that the probability distribution of observed local trends across the globe for the period 1960-2010 is clearly different to what would be expected from internal variability. We detect a distinct intensification of heavy precipitation events and hot extremes. We show that CMIP5 models generally capture the observed shift in the trend distribution but tend to underestimate the intensification of heavy precipitation and cold extremes and overestimate the intensification in hot extremes. Using an initial condition experiment sampling internal variability, we demonstrate that much of the local to regional differences in trends of extremes can be explained by internal variability, which can regionally mask or amplify the forced long-term trends for many decades. ©2014.

   abstract = {Determining the time of emergence of climates altered from their natural state by anthropogenic influences can help inform the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change. Previous studies have examined the time of emergence of climate averages. However, at the global scale, the emergence of changes in extreme events, which have the greatest societal impacts, has not been investigated before. Based on state-of-the-art climate models, we show that temperature extremes generally emerge slightly later from their quasi-natural climate state than seasonal means, due to greater variability in extremes. Nevertheless, according to model evidence, both hot and cold extremes have already emerged across many areas. Remarkably, even precipitation extremes that have very large variability are projected to emerge in the coming decades in Northern Hemisphere winters associated with a wettening trend. Based on our findings we expect local temperature and precipitation extremes to already differ significantly from their previous quasi-natural state at many locations or to do so in the near future. Our findings have implications for climate impacts and detection and attribution studies assessing observed changes in regional climate extremes by showing whether they will likely find a fingerprint of anthropogenic climate change.},

   abstract = {Droughts that exceed the magnitudes of historical variation ranges could occur increasingly frequently under future climate conditions. However, the time of the emergence of unprecedented drought conditions under climate change has rarely been examined. Here, using multimodel hydrological simulations, we investigate the changes in the frequency of hydrological drought (defined as abnormally low river discharge) under high and low greenhouse gas concentration scenarios and existing water resource management measures and estimate the time of the first emergence of unprecedented regional drought conditions centered on the low-flow season. The times are detected for several subcontinental-scale regions, and three regions, namely, Southwestern South America, Mediterranean Europe, and Northern Africa, exhibit particularly robust results under the high-emission scenario. These three regions are expected to confront unprecedented conditions within the next 30 years with a high likelihood regardless of the emission scenarios. In addition, the results obtained herein demonstrate the benefits of the lower-emission pathway in reducing the likelihood of emergence. The Paris Agreement goals are shown to be effective in reducing the likelihood to the unlikely level in most regions. However, appropriate and prior adaptation measures are considered indispensable when facing unprecedented drought conditions. The results of this study underscore the importance of improving drought preparedness within the considered time horizons. Significant regional disparities exist in the time left to prepare for unprecedented drought and how much we can buy time depending on climate scenarios. Specific regions pass this timing by the middle of 21st century even with stringent mitigation.},

   abstract = {The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute used the global climate model EC-Earth3 to perform a large ensemble of simulations (SMHI-LENS). It consists of 50 members, covers the period 1970 to 2100, and comprises the SSP1-1.9, SSP3-3.4, SSP5-3.4-OS, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Thus, it is currently the only large ensemble that allows for analyzing the effect of delayed mitigation actions versus no mitigation efforts and versus earlier efforts leading to similar radiative forcing at the year 2100. We describe the set-up of the SMHI-LENS in detail and provide first examples of its application. The ensemble mean future changes in key variables in the atmosphere and ocean are analyzed and compared against the variability across the ensemble members. In agreement with other large-ensemble simulations, we find that the future changes in the near-surface temperature are more robust than those for precipitation or sea level pressure. As an example of a possible application of the SMHI-LENS, we analyze the probability of exceeding specific global surface warming levels in the different scenarios. None of the scenarios is able to keep global warming in the 21st century below 1.5gg C. In SSP1-1.9 there is a probability of approximately 70g% to stay below 2gg C warming, while all other SSPs exceed this target in every single member of SMHI-LENS during the course of the century. We also investigate the point in time when the SSP5-8.5 and SSP5-3.4 ensembles separate, i.e., when their differences become significant, and likewise when the SSP5-3.4-OS and SSP4-3.4 ensembles become similar. Last, we show that the time of emergence of a separation between different scenarios can vary by several decades when reducing the ensemble size to 10 members.},

   abstract = {Despite the pervasive impact of drought on human and natural systems, the large-scale mechanisms conducive to regional drying remain poorly understood. Here we use a multivariate approach1,2 to identify two distinct externally forced fingerprints from multiple ensembles of Earth system model simulations. The leading fingerprint, FM1(x), is characterized by global warming, intensified wet–dry patterns3 and progressive large-scale continental aridification, largely driven by multidecadal increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The second fingerprint, FM2(x), captures a pronounced interhemispheric temperature contrast4,5, associated meridional shifts in the intertropical convergence zone6–9 and correlated anomalies in precipitation and aridity over California10, the Sahel11,12 and India. FM2(x) exhibits nonlinear temporal behaviour: the intertropical convergence zone moves southwards before 1975 in response to increases in hemispherically asymmetric sulfate aerosol emissions, and it shifts northwards after 1975 due to reduced sulfur dioxide emissions and the GHG-induced warming of Northern Hemisphere landmasses. Both fingerprints are statistically identifiable in observations of joint changes in temperature, rainfall and aridity during 1950–2014. We show that the reliable simulation of these changes requires combined forcing by GHGs, direct and indirect effects of aerosols, and large volcanic eruptions. Our results suggest that GHG-induced aridification may be modulated regionally by future reductions in sulfate aerosol emissions. Large-scale mechanisms causing regional drying are not well understood. Models and observational data reveal that human-caused changes in GHGs and aerosols led to detectable global and hemispheric signals in the joint behaviour of precipitation, temperature and aridity since the 1950s.},

We demonstrate that dependencies between climate variables can produce larger and earlier departures from natural variability than is detectable in individual variables. Using the example of summer temperature (Tx) and precipitation (Pr), we show that this departure intensification effect occurs when the bivariate climate change trajectory is misaligned with the dominant mode of joint historical variability. Departure intensification is evident in all six CMIP5 models that we examined: 23% (9–34%) of the global land area of each model exhibits a pronounced increase in 2σ anomalies in the Tx-Pr regime relative to Tx or Pr alone. Observational data suggest that summer Tx-Pr correlations in distinct regions on all continents are sufficient to produce departure intensification. Precipitation can be an important driver of multivariate climate change signals relative to natural variability, despite typically having a much weaker univariate signal than temperature. Climate change can drive local climates outside the range of their historical variability, straining the adaptive capacity of ecological communities.

   abstract = {Many climate-related disasters often result from a combination of several climate phenomena, also referred to as "compound events"(CEs). By interacting with each other, these phenomena can lead to huge environmental and societal impacts, at a scale potentially far greater than any of these climate events could have caused separately. Marginal and dependence properties of the climate phenomena forming the CEs are key statistical properties characterising their probabilities of occurrence. In this study, we propose a new methodology to assess the time of emergence of CE probabilities, which is critical for mitigation strategies and adaptation planning. Using copula theory, we separate and quantify the contribution of marginal and dependence properties to the overall probability changes of multivariate hazards leading to CEs. It provides a better understanding of how the statistical properties of variables leading to CEs evolve and contribute to the change in their occurrences. For illustrative purposes, the methodology is applied over a 13-member multi-model ensemble (CMIP6) to two case studies: compound wind and precipitation extremes over the region of Brittany (France), and frost events occurring during the growing season preconditioned by warm temperatures (growing-period frost) over central France. For compound wind and precipitation extremes, results show that probabilities emerge before the end of the 21st century for six models of the CMIP6 ensemble considered. For growing-period frosts, significant changes of probability are detected for 11 models. Yet, the contribution of marginal and dependence properties to these changes in probabilities can be very different from one climate hazard to another, and from one model to another. Depending on the CE, some models place strong importance on both marginal properties and dependence properties for probability changes. These results highlight the importance of considering changes in both marginal and dependence properties, as well as their inter-model variability, for future risk assessments related to CEs.},

   abstract = {Recent studies indicated that the internal climate variability plays an important role in various aspects of projected climate changes on regional and local scales. Here we present results of the spreads in projected trends of wintertime North American surface air temperature and extremes indices of warm and cold days over the next half-century, by analyzing a 50-member large ensemble of climate simulations conducted with CanESM2. CanESM2 simulations confirm the important role of internal variability in projected surface temperature trends as demonstrated in previous studies. Yet the spread in North American warming trends in CanESM2 is generally smaller than those obtained from CCSM3 and ECHAM5 large ensemble simulations. Despite this, large spreads in the climate means as well as climate change trends of North American temperature extremes are apparent in CanESM2, especially in the projected cold day trends. The ensemble mean of forced climate simulations reveals high risks of warm days over the western coast and northern Canada, as well as a weakening belt of cold days extending from Alaska to the northeast US. The individual ensemble members differ from the ensemble mean mainly in magnitude of the warm day trends, but depart considerably from the ensemble mean in spatial pattern and magnitude of the cold day trends. The signal-to-noise ratio pattern of the warm day trend resembles that of the surface air temperature trend, with stronger signals over northern Canada, Alaska, and the southwestern US than the midsection of the continent. The projected cold day patterns reveal strong signals over the southwestern US, northern Canada, and the northeastern US. In addition, the internally generated components of mean and extreme temperature trends exhibit spatial coherences over North America, and are comparable to their externally forced trends. The large-scale atmospheric circulation-induced temperature variability influences these trends. Overall, our results suggest that climate change trends of North American temperature extremes are likely very uncertain and need to be applied with caution.},

Twentieth-century CUS trends were positive for the great majority of simulations, but were negative, as observed, for seven simulations. Only a few simulations exhibited the observed rapid rate of warming (cooling) during 1901-40 (1940-79). Those models with multiple runs (identical forcing but different initial conditions) showed considerable intramodel variability with trends varying by up to 1.8°C century-1, suggesting that internal dynamic variability played a major role at the regional scale. The wide range of trend outcomes, particularly for those models with multiple runs, and the small number of simulations similar to observations in both the forced and unforced experiments suggest that the warming hole is not a robust response of contemporary CGCMs to the estimated external forcings. A more likely explanation based on these models is that the observed warming hole involves external forcings combined with internal dynamic variability that is much larger than typically simulated. The observed CUS temperature variations are positively correlated with North Atlantic (NA) sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and both NA SSTs and CUS temperature are negatively correlated with central equatorial Pacific (CEP) SSTs. Most models simulate rather well the connection between CUS temperature and NA SSTs. However, the teleconnections between NA and CEP SSTS and between CEP SSTs and CUS temperature are poorly simulated and the models produce substantially less NA SST variability than observed, perhaps hampering their ability to reproduce the warming hole. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

Trends in maximum summertime temperature, moisture, and heat index are tracked over three time periods: 1900–2011, 1950–2011, and 1979–2011; these trends differ notably from annual temperature trends. Trends are emphasized from two CRU datasets (CRUTS3.25 and CRUTS4.01) and two reanalyses (ERA-20C and 20CRv2). Maximum temperature trends tend towards warming that is stronger over the Great Lakes, the interior western and the northeastern contiguous United States. A warming hole in the Midwest generally decreases in size and magnitude when heat stress trends are calculated because the region has increasing moisture. CRU and nearly all reanalyses find cooling in the northern high plains that is not found in NOAA Climate Division trends. These NOAA trends are captured better by CRUTS401. Moistening in the northeast amplifies the heat stress there. Elsewhere the moisture trends are less clear. Drying over northern Texas (after 1996) in CRUTS401 translates into decreasing heat stress there (less so in CRUTS325). Though other reanalyses are not intended for long-term trends, MERRA-2 and ERA-Interim match observed trends better than other reanalyses.},

At the same time, agricultural practices can modify temperatures by altering the surface energy budget. Here we identify centennial trends towards more favourable growing conditions in the US Midwest, including cooler summer temperature extremes and increased precipitation, and investigate the origins of these shifts. Statistically significant correspondence is found between the cooling pattern and trends in cropland intensification, as well as with trends towards greater irrigated land over a small subset of the domain. Land conversion to cropland, often considered an important influence on historical temperatures, is not significantly associated with cooling. We suggest that agricultural intensification increases the potential for evapotranspiration, leading to cooler temperatures and contributing to increased precipitation. The tendency for greater evapotranspiration on hotter days is consistent with our finding that cooling trends are greatest for the highest temperature percentiles. Temperatures over rainfed croplands show no cooling trend during drought conditions, consistent with evapotranspiration requiring adequate soil moisture, and implying that modern drought events feature greater warming as baseline cooler temperatures revert to historically high extremes.},

   abstract = {We investigate the climate response to changing US anthropogenic aerosol sources over the 1950-2050 period by using the NASA GISS general circulation model (GCM) and comparing to observed US temperature trends. Time-dependent aerosol distributions are generated from the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model applied to historical emission inventories and future projections. Radiative forcing from US anthropogenic aerosols peaked in 1970-1990 and has strongly declined since due to air quality regulations. We find that the regional radiative forcing from US anthropogenic aerosols elicits a strong regional climate response, cooling the central and eastern US by 0.5-1.0 °C on average during 1970-1990, with the strongest effects on maximum daytime temperatures in summer and autumn. Aerosol cooling reflects comparable contributions from direct and indirect (cloud-mediated) radiative effects. Absorbing aerosol (mainly black carbon) has negligible warming effect. Aerosol cooling reduces surface evaporation and thus decreases precipitation along the US east coast, but also increases the southerly flow of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico resulting in increased cloud cover and precipitation in the central US. Observations over the eastern US show a lack of warming in 1960-1980 followed by very rapid warming since, which we reproduce in the GCM and attribute to trends in US anthropogenic aerosol sources. Present US aerosol concentrations are sufficiently low that future air quality improvements are projected to cause little further warming in the US (0.1 °C over 2010-2050). We find that most of the warming from aerosol source controls in the US has already been realized over the 1980-2010 period. © 2012 Author(s).},

We utilize two 50-member sets of coupled climate model simulations, one with only anthropogenic aerosol forcings and another with all known natural and anthropogenic forcings, together with a long control integration. We show that, in the absence of aerosol forcing, none of the model simulations capture the observed surface cooling rate (∼0.56°C decade−1), whereas with increasing aerosol emissions 2 (of 50) of the simulations do. More importantly, however, we find that the cooling from aerosols (0.20°C decade−1) is insufficient to explain the observation. Our results therefore suggest that, while aerosols may have played a role, the observed cooling was a rare event that contained a large contribution from unforced internal variability.},

However, the relative contributions of each of these forcings to the observed regional changes remain unclear. Results of both regional climate model simulations and observational analyses suggest that much of the observed rainfall increase—as well as the decrease in temperature and increase in humidity—is attributable to agricultural intensification in the central United States, with natural variability and GHG emissions playing secondary roles.

   abstract = {Uncertainty in climate projections is driven by three components: scenario uncertainty, intermodel uncertainty, and internal variability. Although socioeconomic climate impact studies increasingly take into account the first two components, little attention has been paid to the role of internal variability, although underestimating this uncertainty may lead to underestimating the socioeconomic costs of climate change. Using large ensembles from seven coupled general circulation models with a total of 414 model runs, we partition the climate uncertainty in classic dose–response models relating county-level corn yield, mortality, and per-capita gross domestic product to temperature in the continental United States. The partitioning of uncertainty depends on the time frame of projection, the impact model, and the geographic region. Internal variability represents more than 50% of the total climate uncertainty in certain projections, including mortality projections for the early 21st century, although its relative influence decreases over time. We recommend including uncertainty due to internal variability for many projections of temperature-driven impacts, including early-century and midcentury projections, projections in regions with high internal variability such as the Upper Midwest United States, and impacts driven by nonlinear relationships.},

We investigate the roles of anthropogenic forcing and internal variability on these trends by systematically examining observed seasonal temperature trends over all time periods of at least 10 years during 1901-2015. Long-term summer cooling in the north central U.S. beginning in the 1930s reflects the recovery from the anomalously warm 'Dust Bowl' of that decade. In the northeast and southern U.S., significant summertime cooling occurs from the early 1950s to the mid 1970s, which we partially attribute to increasing anthropogenic aerosol emissions (median fraction of the observed temperature trends explained is 0.69 and 0.17, respectively). In winter, the northeast and southern U.S. cool significantly from the early 1950s to the early 1990s, but we do not find evidence for a significant aerosol influence. Instead, long-term phase changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation contribute significantly to this cooling in both regions, while the Pacific Decadal Oscillation also contributes significantly to southern U.S. cooling. Rather than stemming from a single cause, the U.S. warming hole reflects both anthropogenic aerosol forcing and internal climate variability, but the dominant drivers vary by season, region, and time period.},

In contrast to the widespread global warming, the central and south central United States display a noteworthy overall cooling trend during the 20th century, with an especially striking cooling trend in summertime daily maximum temperature (Tmax) (termed the U.S. "warming hole"). Here we used observations of temperature, shortwave cloud forcing (SWCF), longwave cloud forcing (LWCF), aerosol optical depth and precipitable water vapor as well as global coupled climate models to explore the attribution of the "warming hole". Wefind that the observed cooling trend in summer Tmax can be attributed mainly to SWCF due to aerosols with offset from the greenhouse effect of precipitable water vapor. Aglobal coupled climate model reveals that the observed "warming hole" can be produced only when the aerosol fields are simulated with a reasonable degree of accuracy as this is necessary for accurate simulation of SWCF over the region. These results provide compelling evidence of the role of the aerosol indirect effect in cooling regional climate on the Earth. Our results reaffirm that LWCF can warm both winter Tmax and Tmin.},

We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000-2015, contributed to 75% more forested area experiencing high (>1 σ) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for ∼55% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984-2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.},

Significant increases in annual area burned at high severity (AABhs) were observed across most ecoregions, with an overall eightfold increase in AABhs across western US forests. The relationships we identified between the annual fire severity metrics and climate, as well as the observed and projected trend toward warmer and drier fire seasons, suggest that climate change will contribute to increased fire severity in future decades where fuels remain abundant. The growing prevalence of high-severity fire in western US forests has important implications to forest ecosystems, including an increased probability of fire-catalyzed conversions from forest to alternative vegetation types.},

   abstract = {California is currently in the midst of a record-setting drought. The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. Analyzing historical climate observations from California, we find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. Climate model experiments with and without anthropogenic forcings reveal that human activities have increased the probability that dry precipitation years are also warm. Further, a large ensemble of climate model realizations reveals that additional global warming over the next few decades is very likely to create ∼100% probability that any annual-scale dry period is also extremely warm. We therefore conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm-dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the "exceptional" 2012-2014 drought in California.},

It has only been in the twenty-first century that human populations in these regions of the Northern Hemisphere have experienced heat extremes comparable to the 1930s. This demonstrates that humans influenced Northern Hemisphere temperature and heat extremes through disastrous and unprecedented regional land use practices over the Great Plains, and points to the possibility that future intense regional droughts could affect heat extremes on hemispheric scales.},

The effects of the eruption were less evident by 1994.

   abstract = {Record-breaking summer heat waves were experienced across the contiguous United States during the decade-long "Dust Bowl" drought in the 1930s. Using high-quality daily temperature observations, the Dust Bowl heat wave characteristics are assessed with metrics that describe variations in heat wave activity and intensity. Despite the sparser station coverage in the early record, there is robust evidence for the emergence of exceptional heat waves across the central Great Plains, the most extreme of which were preconditioned by anomalously dry springs. This is consistent with the entire twentieth-century record: summer heat waves over the Great Plains develop on average ~15-20 days earlier after anomalously dry springs, compared to summers following wet springs. Heat waves following dry springs are also significantly longer and hotter, indicative of the importance of land surface feedbacks in heat wave intensification. A distinctive anomalous continental-wide circulation pattern accompanied exceptional heat waves in the Great Plains, including those of the Dust Bowl decade. An anomalous broad surface pressure ridge straddling an upper-level blocking anticyclone over the western United States forced substantial subsidence and adiabatic warming over the Great Plains, and triggered anomalous southward warm advection over southern regions. This prolonged and amplified the heat waves over the central United States, which in turn gradually spread westward following heat wave emergence. The results imply that exceptional heat waves are preconditioned, triggered, and strengthened across the Great Plains through a combination of spring drought, upper-level continental-wide anticyclonic flow, and warm advection from the north.},

Using a novel assessment of heat extremes, we investigate how extreme this event was in the global context. Characterizing the relative intensity of an event as the number of standard deviations from the mean, the western North America heat wave is remarkable, coming in at over four standard deviations. Throughout the globe, where we have reliable data, only five other heat waves were found to be more extreme since 1960. We find that in both reanalyses and climate projections, the statistical distribution of extremes increases through time, in line with the distribution mean shift due to climate change. Regions that, by chance, have not had a recent extreme heat wave may be less prepared for potentially imminent events.},

If the record can be shown to be homogenous, then it would be the first reanalysis suitable for long-term trend assessments, including those of the regional hydrologic cycle. On the other hand, if discontinuities exist, then their detection and attribution-either to artificial observational shocks or climate change-is critical to their proper treatment. Previous research suggested that the quintupling of 20CR's assimilated observation counts over the central United States was the primary cause of inhomogeneities for that region. The same work also revealed that, depending on the season, the complete record could be considered homogenous. In this study, we apply the Bai-Perron structural change point test to extend these analyses globally. A rigorous evaluation of 20CR's (in)homogeneity is performed, composed of detailed quantitative analyses on regional, seasonal, inter-variable, and intra-ensemble bases. The 20CR record is shown to be homogenous (natural) for 69 (89) years at 50 % of land grids, based on analysis of the July 2 m air temperature. On average 54 % (41 %) of the grids between 60°S and 60°N are free from artificial inhomogenetites in their February (July) time series. Of the more than 853,376 abrupt shifts detected in 26 variable fields over two monthly time series, approximately 72 % are non-climate in origin; 25 % exceed 1.8 standard deviations of the preceding time series. The knock-on effect of inhomogeneities in 20CR's boundary forcing and surface pressure data inputs to its surface analysis fields is implicated. In the future, reassessing these inhomogeneities will be imperative to achieving a more definitive attribution of 20CR's abrupt shifts. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Because over land 20CR only assimilates surface pressure observations and their count increases by an order of magnitude over the course of the record, a key question is whether the 20CR is homogenous and hence suitable for detecting climate-related changes. We use three statistical methods (Pettitt and Bai-Perron tests and segmented regression) to detect abrupt shifts in multiple hydrometeorological variable mean and uncertainty fields over the central United States. For surface air temperature and precipitation, we use the Climate Research Unit (CRU) time series data set for comparison. We find that for warm-season months, there is a consensus change point among all variables between 1940 and 1950, which is not substantiated by the CRU record. While we cannot say with certainty that these shifts in the 20CR analysis fields are artificial, our statistical analyses, coupled with a visual inspection of the underlying assimilated observational count time series, strongly point to this conclusion. Our recommendation is therefore for users to restrict climate trend applications over the central United States to the second half century of the 20CR record, after observational density has stabilized.

The period included the 1930s Dust Bowl drought4–7 across North America’s Great Plains that caused widespread crop failures4,8, large dust storms9 and considerable out-migration10. This coincided with the central United States experiencing its hottest summers of the twentieth century11,12 in 1934 and 1936, with over 40 heatwave days and maximum temperatures surpassing 44 °C at some locations13,14. Here we use a large-ensemble regional modelling framework to show that GHG increases caused slightly enhanced heatwave activity over the eastern United States during 1934 and 1936. Instead of asking how a present-day heatwave would behave in a world without climate warming, we ask how these 1930s heatwaves would behave with present-day GHGs. Heatwave activity in similarly rare events would be much larger under today’s atmospheric GHG forcing and the return period of a 1-in-100-year heatwave summer (as observed in 1936) would be reduced to about 1-in-40 years. A key driver of the increasing heatwave activity and intensity is reduced evaporative cooling and increased sensible heating during dry springs and summers. The United States experienced two of its hottest recorded summers in 1934 and 1936, amplified by drier soils associated with the Dust Bowl drought. A large regional climate model ensemble estimates present-day GHGs would cause similarly extreme, 1-in-100-year heatwaves to occur about every 40 years.},

Conversely, station data from 1920 to 2013 showed decreased extent of absolute highest records with nearly half of such records occurring in the 1930s during exceptional widespread drought. Simulated changes in the extent of absolute temperature records from climate model experiments were in general agreement with observed changes for recent decades.

   abstract = {Observed temperature extremes over the continental United States can be represented by the ratio of daily record high temperatures to daily record low minimum temperatures, and this ratio has increased to a value of about 2 to 1, averaged over the first decade of the 21st century, albeit with large interannual variability. Two different versions of a global coupled climate model (CCSM4), as well as 23 other coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) models, show larger values of this ratio than observations, mainly as a result of greater numbers of record highs since the 1980s compared with observations. This is partly because of the "warm 1930s" in the observations, which made it more difficult to set record highs later in the century, and partly because of a trend toward less rainfall and reduced evapotranspirationin the model versions compared with observations. We compute future projections of this ratio on the basis of its estimated dependence on mean temperature increase, which we find robustly at play in both observations and simulations. The use of this relation also has the advantage of removing dependence of a projection on a specific scenario. An empirical projection of the ratio of record highs to record lows is obtained from the nonlinear relationship in observations from 1930 to 2015, thus correcting downward the likely biased future projections of the model. For example, for a 3 °C warming in US temperatures, the ratio of record highs to lows is projected to be ∼15 ± 8 compared to the present average ratio of just over 2.},

neural network trained on this data successfully predicts the year. Differences
among temperature and precipitation patterns for which the model predicts

new way of interpreting what the neural network has learned is explored.

Nonetheless, the difficulty in interpreting deep learning results still prevents their applications to studies on climate dynamics. Here, we applied a convolutional neural network to understand El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dynamics from long-term climate model simulations. The deep learning algorithm successfully predicted ENSO events with a high correlation skill (∼0.82) for a 9-month lead. For interpreting deep learning results beyond the prediction, we present a “contribution map” to estimate how much the grid box and variable contribute to the output and “contribution sensitivity” to estimate how much the output variable is changed to the small perturbation of the input variables. The contribution map and sensitivity are calculated by modifying the input variables to the pretrained deep learning, which is quite similar to the occlusion sensitivity. Based on the two methods, we identified three precursors of ENSO and investigated their physical processes with El Niño and La Niña development. In particular, it is suggested here that the roles of each precursor are asymmetric between El Niño and La Niña. Our results suggest that the contribution map and sensitivity are simple approaches but can be a powerful tool in understanding ENSO dynamics and they might be also applied to other climate phenomena.},

Here we test the extent to which developments in deep learning can out-perform existing statistical approaches for downscaling historical rainfall in the highly complex terrain setting of New Zealand. While deep learning removes the need for manual feature selection when extracting spatial-temporal information from predictor fields, several key considerations need to be addressed. These include: the chosen complexity of the network architecture, suitable loss functions tailored to the problem, as well as input data considerations of domain size and amount of training data required to provide adequate out-of-sample generalization. Sensitivity testing to these considerations reveals that a relatively simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with carefully selected loss functions can considerably outperform existing statistical downscaling models based on multiple linear regression with manual feature selection. When aggregated across the entire region, the fraction of explained variance on wet days increased from 0.35 to 0.52, the root-mean-squared error reduced by over 20% and percentage biases for the 90th percentile of rainfall improved by over 25%. Using interpretable machine learning methods, we demonstrate that the CNN has been capable of self-learning physically plausible relationships between the large-scale atmospheric environment and extreme localized rainfall events. The historical performance and physical interpretability documented here lends support for wider development and application of deep learning in climate downscaling.},

We show the response to an increase of atmospheric resolution from 0.8 to 0.3° horizontal grid spacing in parallel ensembles of forecasts. Changes in the prediction skill of major modes of tropical El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and extratropical North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) variability are small and not detected and there is no discernible impact on the weak signal-to-noise ratio in seasonal predictions of the winter NAO at this range of resolutions. Although studies have shown improvements in the simulation of tropical cyclones as model resolution is increased, we find little impact on seasonal prediction skill of either their numbers or intensity. Over this range of resolutions it appears that the benefit of increasing atmospheric resolution to seasonal climate predictions is minimal. However, at yet finer scales there appears to be increased eddy feedback which could strengthen weak signals in predictions of the NAO. Until prediction systems can be run operationally at these scales, it may be better to use additional computing resources for other enhancements such as increased ensemble size, for which there is a clear benefit in extratropical seasonal prediction skill.},

A three-way tension exists between the allocation of computing resources to refine model resolution, the expansion of model complexity/capability, and the increase of ensemble size. Here we review evidence for the benefits of increased ocean resolution in global coupled models, where the ocean component explicitly represents transient mesoscale eddies and narrow boundary currents. We consider lessons learned from forced ocean/sea-ice simulations; from studies concerning the SST resolution required to impact atmospheric simulations; and from coupled predictions. Impacts of the mesoscale ocean in western boundary current regions on the large-scale atmospheric state have been identified. Understanding of air-sea feedback in western boundary currents is modifying our view of the dynamics in these key regions. It remains unclear whether variability associated with open ocean mesoscale eddies is equally important to the large-scale atmospheric state. We include a discussion of what processes can presently be parameterised in coupled models with coarse resolution non-eddying ocean models, and where parameterizations may fall short. We discuss the benefits of resolution and identify gaps in the current literature that leave important questions unanswered.},

A reliable sea-ice reanalysis can be useful to study Antarctic SIT and its role in the Earth system. Among various Antarctic sea-ice reanalysis products, the Global Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (GIOMAS) output is widely used in the research of Antarctic sea ice. As more Antarctic SIT observations with quality control are being released, a further evaluation of Antarctic SIT from GIOMAS is conducted in this study based on in situ and satellite observations. Generally, though only sea-ice concentration is assimilated, GIOMAS can basically reproduce the observed variability in sea-ice volume and its changes in the trend before and after 2013, indicating that GIOMAS is a good option to study the long-term variation in Antarctic sea ice. However, due to deficiencies in the model and asymmetric changes in SIT caused by assimilation, GIOMAS underestimates Antarctic SIT especially in deformed ice regions, which has an impact on not only the mean state of SIT but also the variability. Thus, besides the further development of the model, assimilating additional sea-ice observations (e.g., SIT and sea-ice drift) with advanced assimilation methods may be conducive to a more accurate estimation of Antarctic SIT.},

   abstract = {Plastic sea ice rheologies that employ teardrop and parabolic lens yield curves and allow varying biaxial tensile stresses have been developed. These rheologies, together with the previously developed ellipse and Mohr-Coulomb-ellipse rheologies, are implemented in a thickness and enthalpy distribution sea ice model to examine the rheological effect in numerical investigations of arctic climate. The teardrop, lens, and ellipse rheologies obey a normal flow rule and result in a two-peak shear stress distribution. The first peak is at the zero shear stress; the second is near 16,000 N m-1 for the ellipse and two lens rheologies and near 30,000 N m-1 for the two teardrop rheologies. The location of the second peak depends on the fatness of the yield curve and the amount of biaxial tensile stress allowed. In contrast, the Mohr-Coulomb-ellipse rheology, based on Coulombic friction failure, does not tend to create the second peak. The incorporation of biaxial tensile stress tends to increase ice thickness in most of the Arctic. A fatter yield curve tends to increase the frequency of large shear stresses. An increased frequency of large shear stresses, in conjunction with the inclusion of biaxial tensile stress, tends to reduce ice speed and ice export, to enhance ice ridging in the Arctic interior, and to reduce ice ridging in the coastal areas, which has a significant impact on arctic spatial ice mass distribution and the total ice budget. The teardrop rheologies reduce spatial bias of modeled ice draft against submarine observations more than others. By changing ice motion, deformation, and thickness the choice of plastic rheology also considerably affects the simulated surface energy exchanges, particularly in the Arctic marginal seas.

   abstract = {Results from a numerical model simulation show significant changes in the dynamic properties of Arctic sea ice during 2007-2011 compared to the 1979-2006 mean. These changes are linked to a 33% reduction in sea ice volume, with decreasing ice concentration, mostly in the marginal seas, and decreasing ice thickness over the entire Arctic, particularly in the western Arctic. The decline in ice volume results in a 37% decrease in ice mechanical strength and 31% in internal ice interaction force, which in turn leads to an increase in ice speed (13%) and deformation rates (17%). The increasing ice speed has the tendency to drive more ice out of the Arctic. However, ice volume export is reduced because the rate of decrease in ice thickness is greater than the rate of increase in ice speed, thus retarding the decline of Arctic sea ice volume. Ice deformation increases the most in fall and least in summer. Thus the effect of changes in ice deformation on the ice cover is likely strong in fall and weak in summer. The increase in ice deformation boosts ridged ice production in parts of the central Arctic near the Canadian Archipelago and Greenland in winter and early spring, but the average ridged ice production is reduced because less ice is available for ridging in most of the marginal seas in fall. The overall decrease in ridged ice production contributes to the demise of thicker, older ice. As the ice cover becomes thinner and weaker, ice motion approaches a state of free drift in summer and beyond and is therefore more susceptible to changes in wind forcing. This is likely to make seasonal or shorter-term forecasts of sea ice edge locations more challenging.},

Forecast ice drift speed is compared to drifting buoys and other observational platforms. Forecast positions are compared with actual positions 24 h-8 days since forecast. Forecast results are further compared to those from the forecasts generated using an ice velocity climatology driven by multiyear integrations of the same model. The results are presented in the context of scheduling the acquisition of high-resolution images that need to follow buoys or scientific research platforms. RMS errors for ice speed are on the order of 5 km/d for 24-48 h since forecast using the sea ice model compared with 9 km/d using climatology. Predicted buoy position RMS errors are 6.3 km for 24 h and 14 km for 72 h since forecast. Model biases in ice speed and direction can be reduced by adjusting the air drag coefficient and water turning angle, but the adjustments do not affect verification statistics. This suggests that improved atmospheric forecast forcing may further reduce the forecast errors. The model remains skillful for 8 days. Using the forecast model increases the probability of tracking a target drifting in sea ice with a 10 km × 10 km image from 60 to 95% for a 24 h forecast and from 27 to 73% for a 48 h forecast.},

Our study examines the historical representation of sea ice extent, volume, and thickness using spatial analysis metrics, such as the integrated ice edge error, Brier score, and spatial probability score. We find that the CMIP6 multimodel mean captures the mean annual cycle and 1979-2014 sea ice trends remarkably well. However, individual models experience a wide range of uncertainty in the spatial distribution of sea ice when compared against satellite measurements and reanalysis data. Our metrics expose common and individual regional model biases, which sea ice temporal analyses alone do not capture. We identify large ice edge and ice thickness errors in Arctic subregions, implying possible model specific limitations in or lack of representation of some key physical processes. We postulate that many of them could be related to the oceanic forcing, especially in the marginal and shelf seas, where seasonal sea ice changes are not adequately simulated. We therefore conclude that an individual model's ability to represent the observed/reanalysis spatial distribution still remains a challenge. We propose the spatial analysis metrics as useful tools to diagnose model limitations, narrow down possible processes affecting them, and guide future model improvements critical to the representation and projections of Arctic climate change.},

The slowdown of the SIV decline is because the decrease in ice export from the Arctic exceeds the decrease in net ice production within the Arctic. The relatively strong decrease in ice export occurs when the increase in ice motion is lower than the decrease in SIV. The relatively weak decrease in net ice production is due to strong increases in ice growth as thinner ice grows faster than thicker ice under freezing conditions. The ice growth increases are closely correlated with and benefit from increases in open water creation caused by enhanced ice divergence and shear as thinner ice is easier to deform.},

While this is well known, there are no estimates of the magnitude of this threshold, nor of the proportion of sea ice area that is below this threshold as ice thins. We determine this threshold by simulating the atmospheric response to varying thicknesses, ranging from 0.0 to 2.0 m and determine that threshold to be 0.40–0.50 m. The resulting “effective” ice area is 4–14% lower than reported total ice area, as 0.39–0.97 × 106 km2 of the total ice area falls below the threshold throughout the twentieth century, including during notable ice minima. The atmosphere above large non-insulating ice-covered regions is susceptible to more than 2 °C of warming despite ice presence. Observed mean Arctic Ocean ice thickness is projected to fall below this threshold as early as the mid-2020s. Studies on ocean–atmosphere interactions in relation to sea ice area should focus on this insulating sea ice area, where ice is at least 0.40–0.50 m thick, and treat ice regions below 0.40–0.50 m thickness with caution.},

Misclassified leads were removed from the freeboard algorithm in the third release (rel003) of ATL10, which generally results in an increase in freeboards compared to rel002 data. The thickness increases due to increased freeboards in ATL10 improved comparisons of Inner Arctic Ocean sea ice thickness with thickness estimates from ESA's CryoSat-2. The upgrade from NESOSIM v1.0 to v1.1 results in only small changes in snow depth and density which have a less significant impact on thickness compared to the rel002 to rel003 ATL10 freeboard changes. The updated monthly gridded thickness data are validated against ice draft measurements obtained by upward-looking sonar moorings deployed in the Beaufort Sea, showing strong agreement (r2 of 0.87, differences of 11 ± 20 cm). The seasonal cycle in winter monthly mean Arctic sea ice thickness shows good agreement with various CryoSat-2 products (and a merged ICESat-2-CryoSat-2 product) and PIOMAS (Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System).

More consecutive NWs have emerged annually for both OW ships and PC6 ships since 2005 because of the faster sea ice retreat. Since the 1980s, the number of simulated Arctic routes has continuously increased, and optimal navigability exists in these years of record-low sea ice extent (e.g., 2012 and 2020). Summertime navigability in the East Siberian and Laptev Seas, on the other hand, varies dramatically due to changing sea ice conditions. This systematic assessment of Arctic navigability provides a reference for better projecting the future trans-Arctic shipping routes.},

   abstract = {Atmospheric reanalyses are widely used to estimate the past atmospheric near-surface state over sea ice. They provide boundary conditions for sea ice and ocean numerical simulations and relevant information for studying polar variability and anthropogenic climate change. Previous research revealed the existence of large near-surface temperature biases (mostly warm) over the Arctic sea ice in the current generation of atmospheric reanalyses, which is linked to a poor representation of the snow over the sea ice and the stably stratified boundary layer in the forecast models used to produce the reanalyses. These errors can compromise the employment of reanalysis products in support of polar research. Here, we train a fully connected neural network that learns from remote sensing infrared temperature observations to correct the existing generation of uncoupled atmospheric reanalyses (ERA5, JRA-55) based on a set of sea ice and atmospheric predictors, which are themselves reanalysis products. The advantages of the proposed correction scheme over previous calibration attempts are the consideration of the synoptic weather and cloud state, compatibility of the predictors with the mechanism responsible for the bias, and a self-emerging seasonality and multi-decadal trend consistent with the declining sea ice state in the Arctic. The correction leads on average to a 27% temperature bias reduction for ERA5 and 7% for JRA-55 if compared to independent in-situ observations from the MOSAiC campaign (respectively 32% and 10% under clear-sky conditions). These improvements can be beneficial for forced sea ice and ocean simulations, which rely on reanalyses surface fields as boundary conditions.},

The ensemble is constructed by using atmospheric forcing from 2001 to 2007 and the September 2007 ice and ocean conditions estimated by the model. The prediction results show that the record low ice cover and the unusually warm ocean surface waters in summer 2007 lead to a substantial reduction in ice thickness in 2008. Up to 1.2 m ice thickness reduction is predicted in a large area of the Canada Basin in both spring and summer of 2008, leading extraordinarily thin ice in summer 2008. There is a 50% chance that both the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage will be nearly ice free in September 2008.

   abstract = {Numerical experiments are conducted to project arctic sea ice responses to varying levels of future anthropogenic warming and climate variability over 2010-2050. A summer ice-free Arctic Ocean is likely by the mid-2040s if arctic surface air temperature (SAT) increases 4C by 2050 and climate variability is similar to the past relatively warm two decades. If such a SAT increase is reduced by one-half or if a future Arctic experiences a range of SAT fluctuation similar to the past five decades, a summer ice-free Arctic Ocean would be unlikely before 2050. If SAT increases 4C by 2050, summer ice volume decreases to very low levels (10-37% of the 1978-2009 summer mean) as early as 2025 and remains low in the following years, while summer ice extent continues to fluctuate annually. Summer ice volume may be more sensitive to warming while summer ice extent more sensitive to climate variability. The rate of annual mean ice volume decrease relaxes approaching 2050. This is because, while increasing SAT increases summer ice melt, a thinner ice cover increases winter ice growth. A thinner ice cover also results in a reduced ice export, which helps to further slow ice volume loss. Because of enhanced winter ice growth, arctic winter ice extent remains nearly stable and therefore appears to be a less sensitive climate indicator. © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {The authors present results for simulated climate and climate change from a newly developed highresolution global climate model [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model version 2.5 (GFDL CM2.5)]. The GFDL CM2.5 has an atmospheric resolution of approximately 50 km in the horizontal, with 32 vertical levels. The horizontal resolution in the ocean ranges from 28 km in the tropics to 8 km at high latitudes, with 50 vertical levels. This resolution allows the explicit simulation of some mesoscale eddies in the ocean, particularly at lower latitudes. Analyses are presented based on the output of a 280-yr control simulation; also presented are results based on a 140-yr simulation in which atmospheric CO 2 increases at 1% yr -1 until doubling after 70 yr. Results are compared to GFDL CM2.1, which has somewhat similar physics but a coarser resolution. The simulated climate in CM2.5 shows marked improvement over many regions, especially the tropics, including a reduction in the double ITCZ and an improved simulation of ENSO. Regional precipitation features are much improved. The Indian monsoon and Amazonian rainfall are also substantially more realistic in CM2.5. The response of CM2.5 to a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 has many features in common with CM2.1, with some notable differences. For example, rainfall changes over the Mediterranean appear to be tightly linked to topography in CM2.5, in contrast to CM2.1 where the response is more spatially homogeneous. In addition, in CM2.5 the near-surface ocean warms substantially in the high latitudes of the Southern Ocean, in contrast to simulations using CM2.1.},

   abstract = {We compare the United States and global surface air temperature changes of the past century using the current Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) analysis and the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) record [Karl et al., 1990]. Changes in the GISS analysis subsequent to the documentation by Hansen et al. [1999] are as follows: (1) incorporation of corrections for time-of-observation bias and station history adjustments in the United States based on Easterling et al. [1996a], (2) reclassification of rural, small-town, and urban stations in the United States, southern Canada, and northern Mexico based on satellite measurements of night light intensity [Imhoff et al., 1997], and (3) a more flexible urban adjustment than that employed by Hansen et al. [1999], including reliance on only unlit stations in the United States and rural stations in the rest of the world for determining long-term trends. We find evidence cf local human effects ("urban warming") even in suburban and small-town surface air temperature records, but the effect is modest in magnitude and conceivably could be an artifact of inhomogeneities in the station records. We suggest further studies, including more complete satellite night light analyses, which may clarify the potential urban effect. There are inherent uncertainties in the long-term temperature change at least of the order of 0.1°C for both the U.S. mean and the global mean. Nevertheless, it is clear that the post-1930s cooling was much larger in the United States than in the global mean. The U.S. mean temperature has now reached a level comparable to that of the 1930s, while the global temperature is now far above the levels earlier in the century. The successive periods of global warming (1900-1940), cooling (1940-1965), and warming (1965-2000) in the 20th century show distinctive patterns of temperature change suggestive of roles for both climate forcings and dynamical variability. The U.S. was warm in 2000 but cooler than the warmest years in the 1930s and 1990s. Global temperature was moderately high in 2000 despite a lingering La Niña in the Pacific Ocean.

   abstract = {To better understand the regional changes in summertime temperatures across the conterminous United States (CONUS), we adopt a recently developed machine learning framework that can be used to reveal the timing of emergence of forced climate signals from the noise of internal climate variability. Specifically, we train an artificial neural network (ANN) on seasonally-averaged temperatures across the CONUS and then task the ANN to output the year associated with an individual map. In order to correctly identify the year, the ANN must therefore learn time-evolving patterns of climate change amidst the noise of internal climate variability. The ANNs are first trained and tested on data from large ensembles and then evaluated using observations from a station-based dataset. To understand how the ANN is making its predictions, we leverage a collection of ad hoc feature attribution methods from explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). We find that anthropogenic signals in seasonal mean minimum temperature have emerged by the early 2000s for the CONUS, which occurred earliest in the Eastern United States. While our observational timing of emergence estimates are not as sensitive to the spatial resolution of the training data, we find a notable improvement in ANN skill using a higher resolution climate model, especially for its early 20th century predictions. Composites of XAI maps reveal that this improvement is linked to temperatures around higher topography. We find that increases in spatial resolution of the ANN training data may yield benefits for machine learning applications in climate science.},

Although global-scale climatic impacts following the formation of stratospheric sulfate aerosol are well understood, many aspects of the evolution of the early volcanic aerosol cloud and regional impacts are uncertain. In the last twenty years, several advances have been made, mainly due to improved satellite measurements and observations enabling the effects of small-magnitude eruptions to be quantified, new proxy reconstructions used to investigate the impact of past eruptions, and state-of-the-art aerosol-climate modelling that has led to new insights on how volcanic eruptions affect the climate. Looking to the future, knowledge gaps include the role of co-emissions in volcanic plumes, the impact of eruptions on tropical hydroclimate and Northern Hemisphere winter climate, and the role of eruptions in long-term climate change. Future model development, dedicated model intercomparison projects, interdisciplinary collaborations, and the application of advanced statistical techniques will facilitate more complex and detailed studies. Ensuring that the next large-magnitude explosive eruption is well observed will be critical in providing invaluable observations that will bridge remaining gaps in our understanding.},

   abstract = {A cooling trend in summer (May-August) daytime temperatures since the mid-20th Century over the central United States contrasts with strong warming of the western and eastern U.S. Prior studies based on data through 1999 suggested this so-called warming hole arose mainly from internal climate variability, and thus would likely disappear. Yet it has prevailed for two more decades, despite accelerating global warming, compelling reexamination of causes that in addition to natural variability could include anthropogenic aerosol-induced cooling, hydrologic cycle intensification by greenhouse gas increases, and land use change impacts. Here we present evidence for the critical importance of hydrologic cycle change resulting from ocean-atmosphere drivers. Observational analysis reveals the warming hole’s persistence is consistent with unusually high summertime rainfall over the region during the first decades of the 21st Century. Comparative analysis of large ensembles from four different climate models demonstrates that rainfall trends since the mid-20th Century as large as observed can arise (though with low probability) via internal atmospheric variability alone, which induce warming hole-like patterns over the central U.S. Additionally, atmosphere-only model experiments reveal that observed sea surface temperature changes since the mid-20th Century have also favored central U.S cool/wet conditions during the early 21st Century. We argue that this latter effect is symptomatic of external radiative forcing influences, which via constraints on ocean warming patterns has likewise contributed to persistence of the U.S. warming hole in roughly equal proportion to contributions by internal variability. These results have important ramifications for attribution of extreme events and predicting risks of record-breaking heat waves in the region.},

The resulting spread across the model ensemble, which is due solely to unpredictable internally-generated variability, places inherent limits on our ability to predict future climate change at regional and decadal scales. Such initial-condition Large Ensembles (LEs) also provide crucial context for understanding and interpreting the observational record, and foster robust model evaluation and inter-comparison by allowing the forced response to be separated from internally generated variability. LEs also advance the study of extreme events by providing a large number of samples of rare occurrences. In this edition of Variations, we showcase new applications of LEs to the understanding of climate variability and change on regional and decadal scales. These articles, written by early career researchers at the forefront of their fields, span a range of emerging topics including air quality and health, ocean biogeochemistry, best practices for evaluating models’ internal variability, tools for quantifying forced changes in internal variability, and novel pattern recognition methods for detection and attribution. Many of these studies make use of a new multi-model archive of LEs conducted with CMIP5 models produced by the US CLIVAR Working Group on Large Ensembles. This archive, along with LEs being conducted with CMIP6 models, herald a new era in climate science research and applications, and hold promise for new discoveries in the years to come.},

We design a neural network that is interpretable such that its predictions can be decomposed to examine the relative contributions of external forcing and internal variability to future regional sea surface temperature (SST) trend predictions in the near-term climate (2020–2050). We show that there is additional prediction skill to be garnered from internal variability in the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble, even in a relatively high forcing future scenario. This predictability is especially apparent in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Tropical Pacific Oceans as well as in the Southern Ocean. We further investigate how prediction skill covaries across the ocean and find three regions with distinct coherent prediction skill driven by internal variability. SST trend predictability is found to be associated with consistent patterns of decadal variability for the grid points within each region.</p>},

   abstract = {Weather and climate science has undergone a computational revolution in recent decades, to the point where all modern research relies heavily on software and code. Despite this profound change in the research methods employed by weather and climate scientists, the reporting of computational results has changed very little in relevant academic journals. This lag has led to something of a reproducibility crisis, whereby it is impossible to replicate and verify most of today's published computational results. While it is tempting to simply decry the slow response of journals and funding agencies in the face of this crisis, there are very few examples of reproducible weather and climate research upon which to base new communication standards. In an attempt to address this deficiency, this essay describes a procedure for reporting computational results that was employed in a recent Journal of Climate paper. The procedure was developed to be consistent with recommended computational best practices and seeks to minimize the time burden on authors, which has been identified as the most important barrier to publishing code. It should provide a starting point for weather and climate scientists looking to publish reproducible research, and it is proposed that journals could adopt the procedure as a minimum standard.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

   abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different "thinned" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets. © 2014 Nitish Srivastava, Geoffrey Hinton, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever and Ruslan Salakhutdinov.},

This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

   abstract = {<p>With increasing interest in explaining machine learning (ML) models, this paper synthesizes many topics related to ML explainability. We distinguish explainability from interpretability, local from global explainability, and feature importance versus feature relevance. We demonstrate and visualize different explanation methods, how to interpret them, and provide a complete Python package (scikit-explain) to allow future researchers and model developers to explore these explainability methods. The explainability methods include Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), Shapley additive global explanation (SAGE), and accumulated local effects (ALE). Our focus is primarily on Shapley-based techniques, which serve as a unifying framework for various existing methods to enhance model explainability. For example, SHAP unifies methods like local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and tree interpreter for local explainability, while SAGE unifies the different variations of permutation importance for global explainability. We provide a short tutorial for explaining ML models using three disparate datasets: a convection-allowing model dataset for severe weather prediction, a nowcasting dataset for sub-freezing road surface prediction, and satellite-based data for lightning prediction. In addition, we showcase the adverse effects that correlated features can have on the explainability of a model. Finally, we demonstrate the notion of evaluating model impacts of feature groups instead of individual features. Evaluating the feature groups mitigates the impacts of feature correlations and can provide a more holistic understanding of the model. All code, models, and data used in this study are freely available to accelerate the adoption of machine learning explainability in the atmospheric and other environmental sciences.</p>},

In this review, we provide a roughly chronological summary of the application of ML to aspects of weather and climate modelling from early publications through to the latest progress at the time of writing. We also provide an overview of key ML terms, methodologies, and ethical considerations. Finally, we discuss some potentially beneficial future research directions.

   abstract = {Climate models are primary tools for investigating processes in the climate system, projecting future changes, and informing decision makers. The latest generation of models provides increasingly complex and realistic representations of the real climate system, while there is also growing awareness that not all models produce equally plausible or independent simulations. Therefore, many recent studies have investigated how models differ from observed climate and how model dependence affects model output similarity, typically drawing on climatological averages over several decades. Here, we show that temperature maps of individual days drawn from datasets never used in training can be robustly identified as “model” or “observation” using the CMIP6 model archive and four observational products. An important exception is a prototype storm-resolving simulation from ICON-Sapphire which cannot be unambiguously assigned to either category. These results highlight that persistent differences between simulated and observed climate emerge at short timescales already, but very high-resolution modeling efforts may be able to overcome some of these shortcomings. Moreover, temporally out-of-sample test days can be assigned their dataset name with up to 83% accuracy. Misclassifications occur mostly between models developed at the same institution, suggesting that effects of shared code, previously documented only for climatological timescales, already emerge at the level of individual days. Our results thus demonstrate that the use of machine learning classifiers, once trained, can overcome the need for several decades of data to evaluate a given model. This opens up new avenues to test model performance and independence on much shorter timescales.},

   abstract = {In recent years, artificial intelligence and specifically artificial neural networks (NNs) have shown great success in solving complex, nonlinear problems in earth sciences. Despite their success, the strategies upon which NNs make decisions are hard to decipher, which prevents scientists from interpreting and building trust in the NN predictions; a highly desired and necessary condition for the further use and exploitation of NNs’ potential. Thus, a variety of methods have been recently introduced with the aim of attributing the NN predictions to specific features in the input space and explaining their strategy. The so-called eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is already seeing great application in a plethora of fields, offering promising results and insights about the decision strategies of NNs. Here, we provide an overview of the most recent work from our group, applying XAI to meteorology and climate science. Specifically, we present results from satellite applications that include weather phenomena identification and image to image translation, applications to climate prediction at subseasonal to decadal timescales, and detection of forced climatic changes and anthropogenic footprint. We also summarize a recently introduced synthetic benchmark dataset that can be used to improve our understanding of different XAI methods and introduce objectivity into the assessment of their fidelity. With this overview, we aim to illustrate how gaining accurate insights about the NN decision strategy can help climate scientists and meteorologists improve practices in fine-tuning model architectures, calibrating trust in climate and weather prediction and attribution, and learning new science.},

   abstract = {Atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are at unprecedented, record-high levels compared to the last 800 000 years. Those elevated GHG concentrations warm the planet and - partially offset by net cooling effects by aerosols - are largely responsible for the observed warming over the past 150 years. An accurate representation of GHG concentrations is hence important to understand and model recent climate change. So far, community efforts to create composite datasets of GHG concentrations with seasonal and latitudinal information have focused on marine boundary layer conditions and recent trends since the 1980s. Here, we provide consolidated datasets of historical atmospheric concentrations (mole fractions) of 43 GHGs to be used in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments. The presented datasets are based on AGAGE and NOAA networks, firn and ice core data, and archived air data, and a large set of published studies. In contrast to previous intercomparisons, the new datasets are latitudinally resolved and include seasonality. We focus on the period 1850-2014 for historical CMIP6 runs, but data are also provided for the last 2000 years. We provide consolidated datasets in various spatiotemporal resolutions for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as 40 other GHGs, namely 17 ozone-depleting substances, 11 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 9 perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). In addition, we provide three equivalence species that aggregate concentrations of GHGs other than CO2, CH4 and N2O, weighted by their radiative forcing efficiencies. For the year 1850, which is used for pre-industrial control runs, we estimate annual global-mean surface concentrations of CO2 at 284.3 ppm, CH4 at 808.2 ppb and N2O at 273.0 ppb. The data are available at https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/input4mips/ and www.climatecollege.unimelb.edu.au/cmip6. While the minimum CMIP6 recommendation is to use the global- and annual-mean time series, modelling groups can also choose our monthly and latitudinally resolved concentrations, which imply a stronger radiative forcing in the Northern Hemisphere winter (due to the latitudinal gradient and seasonality)..},

In the future, land use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the international community has developed the next generation of advanced Earth system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of human activities (e.g., land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon-climate system. A new set of historical data based on the History of the Global Environment database (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future (2015-2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, is required as input for these models. With most ESM simulations for CMIP6 now completed, it is important to document the land use patterns used by those simulations. Here we present results from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) project, which smoothly connects updated historical reconstructions of land use with eight new future projections in the format required for ESMs. The harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land use patterns, underlying land use transitions, key agricultural management information, and resulting secondary lands annually, while minimizing the differences between the end of the historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions and preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future. The new approach builds on a similar effort from CMIP5 and is now provided at higher resolution (0.25◦ × 0.25◦) over a longer time domain (850-2100, with extensions to 2300) with more detail (including multiple crop and pasture types and associated management practices) using more input datasets (including Landsat remote sensing data) and updated algorithms (wood harvest and shifting cultivation); it is assessed via a new diagnostic package. The new LUH2 products contain > 50 times the information content of the datasets used in CMIP5 and are designed to enable new and improved estimates of the combined effects of land use on the global carbon-climate system.},

These scenarios of 21st-century climate change span many decades, requiring a consideration of potential developments in future society, technology, and energy systems. To understand possibilities for energy resources in this context, the research community draws from Rogner (1997) which proposes a theory of learning-by-extracting (LBE). The LBE hypothesis conceptualizes total geologic occurrences of oil, gas, and coal with a learning model of productivity that has yet to be empirically assessed. This paper finds climate change scenarios anticipate a transition toward coal because of systematic errors in fossil production outlooks based on total geologic assessments like the LBE model. Such blind spots have distorted uncertainty ranges for long-run primary energy since the 1970s and continue to influence the levels of future climate change selected for the SSP-RCP scenario framework. Accounting for this bias indicates RCP8.5 and other ‘business-as-usual scenarios’ consistent with high CO2 forcing from vast future coal combustion are exceptionally unlikely. Therefore, SSP5-RCP8.5 should not be a priority for future scientific research or a benchmark for policy studies.},

We limit our scope to the analysis of strictly geophysical outcomes: Mainly global averages and spatial patterns of change for surface air temperature and precipitation. We also compare CMIP6 projections to CMIP5 results, especially for those scenarios that were designed to provide continuity across the CMIP phases, at the same time highlighting important differences in forcing composition, as well as in results. The range of future temperature and precipitation changes by the end of the century (2081-2100) encompassing the Tier 1 experiments based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) and SSP1-1.9 spans a larger range of outcomes compared to CMIP5, due to higher warming (by close to 1.5-C) reached at the upper end of the 5 %-95% envelope of the highest scenario (SSP5-8.5). This is due to both the wider range of radiative forcing that the new scenarios cover and the higher climate sensitivities in some of the new models compared to their CMIP5 predecessors. Spatial patterns of change for temperature and precipitation averaged over models and scenarios have familiar features, and an analysis of their variations confirms model structural differences to be the dominant source of uncertainty. Models also differ with respect to the size and evolution of internal variability as measured by individual models' initial condition ensemble spreads, according to a set of initial condition ensemble simulations available under SSP3-7.0. These experiments suggest a tendency for internal variability to decrease along the course of the century in this scenario, a result that will benefit from further analysis over a larger set of models. Benefits of mitigation, all else being equal in terms of societal drivers, appear clearly when comparing scenarios developed under the same SSP but to which different degrees of mitigation have been applied. It is also found that a mild overshoot in temperature of a few decades around mid-century, as represented in SSP5-3.4OS, does not affect the end outcome of temperature and precipitation changes by 2100, which return to the same levels as those reached by the gradually increasing SSP4-3.4 (not erasing the possibility, however, that other aspects of the system may not be as easily reversible). Central estimates of the time at which the ensemble means of the different scenarios reach a given warming level might be biased by the inclusion of models that have shown faster warming in the historical period than the observed. Those estimates show all scenarios reaching 1.5-C of warming compared to the 1850-1900 baseline in the second half of the current decade, with the time span between slow and fast warming covering between 20 and 27 years from present. The warming level of 2-C of warming is reached as early as 2039 by the ensemble mean under SSP5-8.5 but as late as the mid-2060s under SSP1-2.6. The highest warming level considered (5-C) is reached by the ensemble mean only under SSP5-8.5 and not until the mid-2090s.},

This bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) technology facilitates the achievement of the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Here, we use five state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs) to explore the consequences of large-scale BECCS deployment on the climate-carbon cycle feedbacks under the CMIP6 SSP5-3.4-OS overshoot scenario keeping in mind that all these models use generic crop vegetation to simulate BECCS. First, we evaluate the land cover representation by ESMs and highlight the inconsistencies that emerge during translation of the data from integrated assessment models (IAMs) that are used to develop the scenario. Second, we evaluate the land-use change (LUC) emissions of ESMs against bookkeeping models. Finally, we show that an extensive cropland expansion for BECCS causes ecosystem carbon loss that drives the acceleration of carbon turnover and affects the CO2 fertilization effect- and climate-change-driven land carbon uptake. Over the 2000-2100 period, the LUC for BECCS leads to an offset of the CO2 fertilization effect-driven carbon uptake by 12.2g% and amplifies the climate-change-driven carbon loss by 14.6g%. A human choice on land area allocation for energy crops should take into account not only the potential amount of the bioenergy yield but also the LUC emissions, and the associated loss of future potential change in the carbon uptake. The dependency of the land carbon uptake on LUC is strong in the SSP5-3.4-OS scenario, but it also affects other Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and should be taken into account by the IAM teams. Future studies should further investigate the trade-offs between the carbon gains from the bioenergy yield and losses from the reduced CO2 fertilization effect-driven carbon uptake where BECCS is applied.},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are the main driver of current and future climate change. The integrated assessment community has quantified anthropogenic emissions for the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios, each of which represents a different future socio-economic projection and political environment. Here, we provide the greenhouse gas concentrations for these SSP scenarios - using the reduced-complexity climate-carbon-cycle model MAGICC7.0.We extend historical, observationally based concentration data with SSP concentration projections from 2015 to 2500 for 43 greenhouse gases with monthly and latitudinal resolution. CO2 concentrations by 2100 range from 393 to 1135 ppm for the lowest (SSP1-1.9) and highest (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios, respectively. We also provide the concentration extensions beyond 2100 based on assumptions regarding the trajectories of fossil fuels and land use change emissions, net negative emissions, and the fraction of non-CO 2 emissions. By 2150, CO2 concentrations in the lowest emission scenario are approximately 350 ppm and approximately plateau at that leveluntil 2500, whereas the highest fossil-fuel-driven scenario projects CO 2 concentrations of 1737 ppm and reaches concentrations beyond 2000 ppm by 2250. We estimate that the share of CO2 in the total radiative forcing contribution of all considered 43 long-lived greenhouse gases increases from 66% for the present day to roughly 68% to 85% by the time of maximum forcing in the 21st century. For this estimation, we updated simple radiative forcing parameterizations that reflect the Oslo Line-By-Line model results. In comparison to the representative concentration pathways (RCPs), the five main SSPs (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) are more evenly spaced and extend to lower 2100 radiative forcing and temperatures. Performing two pairs of six-member historical ensembles with CESM1.2.2, we estimate the effect on surface air temperatures of applying latitudinally and seasonally resolved GHG concentrations. We find that the ensemble differences in the March-April-May (MAM) season provide a regional warming in higher northern latitudes of up to 0.4K over the historical period, latitudinally averaged of about 0.1 K, which we estimate to be comparable to the upper bound (5% level) of natural variability. In comparison to the comparatively straight line of the last 2000 years, the greenhouse gas concentrations since the onset of the industrial period and this studies' projections over the next 100 to 500 years unequivocally depict a "hockey-stick"upwards shape. The SSP concentration time series derived in this study provide a harmonized set of input assumptions for long-term climate science analysis; they also provide an indication of the wide set of futures that societal developments and policy implementations can lead to - ranging from multiple degrees of future warming on the one side to approximately 1.5 °C warming on the other.},

   abstract = {The Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC) is the change in global mean temperature expected to occur following the cessation of net CO2 emissions and as such is a critical parameter for calculating the remaining carbon budget. The Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP) was established to gain a better understanding of the potential magnitude and sign of ZEC, in addition to the processes that underlie this metric. A total of 18 Earth system models of both full and intermediate complexity participated in ZECMIP. All models conducted an experiment where atmospheric CO2 concentration increases exponentially until 1000 PgC has been emitted. Thereafter emissions are set to zero and models are configured to allow free evolution of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Many models conducted additional second-priority simulations with different cumulative emission totals and an alternative idealized emissions pathway with a gradual transition to zero emissions. The inter-model range of ZEC 50 years after emissions cease for the 1000 PgC experiment is-0:36 to 0.29 °C, with a model ensemble mean of-0:07 °C, median of-0:05 °C, and standard deviation of 0.19 °C. Models exhibit a wide variety of behaviours after emissions cease, with some models continuing to warm for decades to millennia and others cooling substantially. Analysis shows that both the carbon uptake by the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere are important for counteracting the warming effect from the reduction in ocean heat uptake in the decades after emissions cease. This warming effect is difficult to constrain due to high uncertainty in the efficacy of ocean heat uptake. Overall, the most likely value of ZEC on multi-decadal timescales is close to zero, consistent with previous model experiments and simple theory.},

   abstract = { Although achieving net-zero emissions is very likely to stabilize the long-term global temperature, the possibility of continued warming and extreme events could cause those efforts to be perceived as a failure if there is an expectation that stabilizing global temperature will also stabilize local and regional climate. Leveraging decarbonization scenarios from multiple global climate models, we find that much of the world faces >30% probability of decadal warming after net-zero CO 2 emissions are achieved, with most areas exhibiting sustained probability of extreme hot and wet events. Further, substantial fractions of the global population and gross domestic product could experience post-net-zero warming, including hundreds of millions of people and trillions of dollars in the United States, China and India during the decade following net-zero. This likelihood suggests that some of the most populous, wealthy, and powerful regions may experience climatic conditions that could be perceived—at least in the near-term—to indicate that climate stabilization policies have failed, highlighting the importance of adaptation for ensuring that communities are prepared for the climate variations that will inevitably occur during and after decarbonization. },

But what, precisely, is the nature of trust in AI? What are the prerequisites and goals of the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction? This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user; and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust', such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of 'trustworthiness' (that detaches from the notion of trustworthiness in sociology), and with it concepts of 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' trust. We present the possible causes of warranted trust as intrinsic reasoning and extrinsic behavior, and discuss how to design trustworthy AI, how to evaluate whether trust has manifested, and whether it is warranted. Finally, we elucidate the connection between trust and XAI using our formalization.},

In response, we adopt a convergent approach to review, evaluate, and synthesize research on the trust and trustworthiness of AI in the environmental sciences and propose a research agenda. Evidential and conceptual histories of research on trust and trustworthiness reveal persisting ambiguities and measurement shortcomings related to inconsistent attention to the contextual and social dependencies and dynamics of trust. Potentially underappreciated in the development of trustworthy AI for environmental sciences is the importance of engaging AI users and other stakeholders, which human–AI teaming perspectives on AI development similarly underscore. Co-development strategies may also help reconcile efforts to develop performance-based trustworthiness standards with dynamic and contextual notions of trust. We illustrate the importance of these themes with applied examples and show how insights from research on trust and the communication of risk and uncertainty can help advance the understanding of trust and trustworthiness of AI in the environmental sciences.},

   abstract = {Climate projections obtained by running global climate models (GCMs) are subject to multi-source uncertainties. The existing framework based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) for decomposing such uncertainties is unable to include the interaction effect between GCM and internal climate variability, which ranks only second to the main effect of GCM in significance. In this study, a three-way ANOVA framework is presented, and all main effects and interaction effects are investigated. The results show that, although the overall uncertainty (O) is mainly contributed by main effects, interaction effects are considerable. Specifically, in the 21st century, the global mean (calculated at the grid-cell level and then averaged, the same below) relative contributions of all main effects are 54% for precipitation and 82% for temperature; those of all interaction effects are respectively 46% and 18%. As the three-way ANOVA cannot investigate the uncertainty components resulting from uncertainty sources, it is improved by deducing the relationship between uncertainty components resulting from uncertainty sources and those resulting from the main effects and interaction effects. By the improved three-way ANOVA, O is decomposed into uncertainty components resulting from emission scenario (S), GCM (M), and internal climate variability (V). The results reveal that O is mainly contributed by M in the 21st century for precipitation, and by M before the 2060s whereas by S thereafter for temperature. The robustness of the V characterization is explored by investigating the variation of V on the number of included ensemble members. The underestimating extent of the V contribution is roughly an average of 4% for precipitation and 1% for temperature.},

   abstract = {The climate scenarios that form the basis for current climate risk assessments have no assigned probabilities, and this impedes the analysis of future climate risks. This paper proposes an approach to estimate the probability of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration scenarios used in key climate change modeling experiments. It computes the CO2 emissions compatible with the concentrations prescribed by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and CMIP6 experiments. The distribution of these compatible cumulative emissions is interpreted as the likelihood of future emissions given a concentration pathway. Using Bayesian analysis, the probability of each pathway can be estimated from a probabilistic sample of future emissions. The approach is demonstrated with five probabilistic CO2 emission simulation ensembles from four Integrated Assessment Models (IAM), leading to independent estimates of the likelihood of the CO2 concentration of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP). Results suggest that SSP5-8.5 is unlikely for the second half of the 21st century, but offer no clear consensus on which of the remaining scenarios is most likely. Estimates of likelihoods of CO2 concentrations associated with RCP and SSP scenarios are affected by sampling errors, differences in emission sources simulated by the IAMs, and a lack of a common experimental framework for IAM simulations. These shortcomings, along with a small IAM ensemble size, limit the applicability of the results presented here. Novel joint IAM and the Earth System Model experiments are needed to deliver actionable probabilistic climate risk assessments.},

   abstract = {Long-term emissions scenarios have served as the primary basis for assessing future climate change and response strategies. Therefore, it is important to regularly reassess the relevance of emissions scenarios in light of changing global circumstances and compare them with long-term developments to determine if they are still plausible, considering the newest insights. Four scenario series, SA90, IS92, SRES, and RCP/SSP, were central in the scenario-based literature informing the five Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the sixth assessment cycle. Here we analyze the historical trends of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industry and emissions drivers between 1960 and 2017. We then compare the emission scenario series with historical trends for the period 1990–2017/2018. The results show that historical trends are quite consistent with medium scenarios in each series. As a result, they can be regarded as valid inputs for past and future analyses of climate change and impacts. Global CO2 emissions 1960–2018 (and 1990–2018) comprised six (and three) overall subperiods of emissions growth significantly higher and lower than average. Historically, CO2 emissions (in absolute numbers and growth rate) are tightly coupled with primary energy and indirectly with GDP. Global emissions generally followed a medium-high pathway, captured by “middle-of-the-road” scenario narratives in the earlier series, and by combinations of “global-sustainability” and “middle-of-the-road” narratives in the most recent series (SRES and SSP-baselines). Historical non-OECD trends were best captured by “rapid-growth” and “regional-competition” scenarios, while OECD trends were close to regional-sustainability and global-sustainability scenarios. Areas where the emissions scenarios captured the historical trends less well, are renewable and nuclear primary energy supply. The fact that the actual historical development is consistent with rapid-growth narratives in the non-OECD regions might have important implications for future greenhouse gas emissions and associated climatic change.},

   abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the year 2021, EFOS increased by 5.1% relative to 2020, with fossil emissions at 10.1±0.5GtCyr-1 (9.9±0.5GtCyr-1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.1±0.7GtCyr-1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission (including the cement carbonation sink) of 10.9±0.8GtCyr-1 (40.0±2.9GtCO2). Also, for 2021, GATM was 5.2±0.2GtCyr-1 (2.5±0.1ppmyr-1), SOCEAN was 2.9 ±0.4GtCyr-1, and SLAND was 3.5±0.9GtCyr-1, with a BIM of -0.6GtCyr-1 (i.e. the total estimated sources were too low or sinks were too high). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2021 reached 414.71±0.1ppm. Preliminary data for 2022 suggest an increase in EFOS relative to 2021 of +1.0% (0.1% to 1.9%) globally and atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 417.2ppm, more than 50% above pre-industrial levels (around 278ppm). Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959-2021, but discrepancies of up to 1GtCyr-1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use change emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extratropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set.

   abstract = {Climate change challenges societal functioning, likely requiring considerable adaptation to cope with future altered weather patterns. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have advanced dramatically, triggering breakthroughs in other research sectors, and recently suggested as aiding climate analysis (Reichstein et al 2019 Nature 566 195-204, Schneider et al 2017 Geophys. Res. Lett. 44 12396-417). Although a considerable number of isolated Earth System features have been analysed with ML techniques, more generic application to understand better the full climate system has not occurred. For instance, ML may aid teleconnection identification, where complex feedbacks make characterisation difficult from direct equation analysis or visualisation of measurements and Earth System model (ESM) diagnostics. Artificial intelligence (AI) can then build on discovered climate connections to provide enhanced warnings of approaching weather features, including extreme events. While ESM development is of paramount importance, we suggest a parallel emphasis on utilising ML and AI to understand and capitalise far more on existing data and simulations.},

   abstract = {Precipitation is characterized by substantial natural variability, including on regional and decadal scales. This relatively large variability poses a grand challenge in assessing the significance of anthropogenically forced precipitation changes. Here we use multiple large ensembles of climate change experiments to evaluate whether ON regional scales, anthropogenic changes in decadal precipitation mean state are distinguishable. Here, distinguishable means the anthropogenic change is outside the range expected from natural variability. Relative to the 1950-1999 period, simulated anthropogenic shifts in precipitation mean state for the 2000-2009 period are already distinguishable over 36-41% of the globe - primarily in high latitudes, eastern subtropical oceans, and the tropics. Anthropogenic forcing in future medium-to-high emission scenarios is projected to cause distinguishable shifts over 68-75% of the globe by 2050 and 86-88% by 2100. Our findings imply anthropogenic shifts in decadal-mean precipitation will exceed the bounds of natural variability over most of the planet within several decades.},

   abstract = {This paper discusses a study of temperature and precipitation indices that may be suitable for the early detection of anthropogenic change in climatic extremes. Anthropogenic changes in daily minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation over land simulated with two different atmosphere-ocean general circulation models are analyzed. The use of data from two models helps to assess which changes might be robust between models. Indices are calculated that scan the transition from mean to extreme climate events within a year. Projected changes in temperature extremes are significantly different from changes in seasonal means over a large fraction (39%-66%) of model grid points. Therefore, the detection of changes in seasonal mean temperature cannot be substituted for the detection of changes in extremes. The estimated signal-to-noise ratio for changes in extreme temperature is nearly as large as for changes in mean temperature. Both models simulate extreme precipitation changes that are stronger than the corresponding changes in mean precipitation. Climate change patterns for precipitation are quite different between the models, but both models simulate stronger increases of precipitation for the wettest day of the year (4.1 % and 8.8%, respectively, over land) than for annual mean precipitation (0% and 0.7%, respectively). A signal-to-noise analysis suggests that changes in moderately extreme precipitation should become more robustly detectable given model uncertainty than changes in mean precipitation. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Abstract. Single model initial-condition large ensembles (LEs) are a useful approach to understand the roles of forced responses and internal variability in historical and future climate change. Here, we produce one of the largest ensembles thus far using the MIROC6 coupled atmosphere–ocean global climate model (MIROC6-LE). The total experimental period of MIROC6-LE is longer than 76 000 years. MIROC6-LE consists of a long preindustrial control run, 50-member historical simulations, 8 single forcing historical experiments with 10 or 50 members, 5 future scenario experiments with 50 members and 3 single forcing future experiments with 50 members. Here, we describe the experimental design. The output data of most of the experiments are freely available to the public. This dataset would be useful to a wide range of research communities. We also demonstrate some examples of initial analyses. Specifically, we confirm that the linear additivity of the forcing-response relationship holds for the 1850–2020 trends of the annual mean values and extreme indices of surface air temperature and precipitation by analyzing historical fully forced runs and the sum of single forced historical runs. To isolate historical anthropogenic signals of annual mean and extreme temperature for 2000–2020 relative to 1850–1900, ensemble sizes of 4 and 15, respectively, are sufficient in most of the world. Historical anthropogenic signals of annual mean and extreme precipitation are significant with the 50-member ensembles in 76 % and 69 % of the world, respectively. Fourteen members are sufficient to examine differences in changes in annual mean values and extreme indices of temperature and precipitation between the shared socioeconomic pathways (ssp), ssp585 and ssp126, in most of the world. Ensembles larger than 50 members are desirable for investigations of differences in annual mean and extreme precipitation changes between ssp126 and ssp119. Historical and future changes in internal variability, represented by departures from the ensemble mean, are analyzed with a focus on the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and global annual mean temperature and precipitation. An ensemble size of 31 is large enough to detect ENSO intensification from preindustrial conditions to 1951–2000, from 1951–2000 to 2051–2100 in all future experiments, and from low- to high-emission future scenario experiments. The single forcing historical experiments with 27 members can isolate ENSO intensification due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings. Future changes in the global mean temperature variability are discernible with 23 members under all future experiments, while 50 members are not sufficient for detecting changes in the global mean precipitation variability in ssp119 and ssp126. We also confirm that these temperature and precipitation variabilities are not precisely analyzed when detrended anomalies from the long-term averages are used due to interannual climate responses to the historical natural forcing, which highlights the importance of large ensembles for assessing internal variability.},

   abstract = {In every IPCC Assessment cycle, a multitude of scenarios are assessed, with different scope and emphasis throughout the various Working Group and Special Reports and their respective chapters. Within the reports, the ambition is to integrate knowledge on possible climate futures across the Working Groups and scientific research domains based on a small set of ‘framing pathways’, such as the so-called RCP pathways from the Fifth IPCC Assessment report (AR5) and the SSP-RCP scenarios in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). This perspective, initiated by discussions at the IPCC Bangkok workshop in April 2023 on the “Use of Scenarios in AR6 and Subsequent Assessments”, is intended to serve as one of the community contributions to highlight needs for the next generation of framing pathways that is being advanced under the CMIP umbrella for use in the IPCC AR7. Here we suggest a number of policy research objectives that such a set of framing pathways should ideally fulfil, including mitigation needs for meeting the Paris Agreement objectives, the risks associated with carbon removal strategies, the consequences of delay in enacting that mitigation, guidance for adaptation needs, loss and damage, and for achieving mitigation in the wider context of Societal Development goals. Based on this context we suggest that the next generation of climate scenarios for Earth System Models should evolve towards ‘Representative Emission Pathways’ (REPs) and suggest key categories for such pathways. These ‘framing pathways’ should address the most critical mitigation policy and adaptation needs over the next 5–10 years. In our view the most important categories are those relevant in the context of the Paris Agreement long-term goal, specifically an immediate action (low overshoot) 1.5 °C pathway, and a delayed action (high overshoot) 1.5 °C pathway. Two other key categories are a pathway category approximately in line with current (as expressed by 2023) near- and long-term policy objectives, and a higher emissions category that is approximately in line with “current policies” (as expressed by 2023). We also argue for the scientific and policy relevance in exploring two ‘worlds that could have been’. One of these categories has high emission trajectories well above what is implied by current policies, and the other has very low emission trajectories that assume that global mitigation action in line with limiting warming to 1.5 °C without overshoot had begun in 2015. Finally, we note that timely provision of new scientific information on pathways is critical to inform the development and implementation of climate policy. For the second Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement in 2028, and to inform subsequent development of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) up to 2040, scientific inputs are required well before 2028. These needs should be carefully considered in the development timeline of community modelling activities including those under CMIP7.},

   abstract = {Previous phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) have primarily focused on simulations driven by atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs), both for idealized model experiments, and for climate 35 projections of different emissions scenarios. We argue that although this approach was pragmatic to allow parallel development of Earth System Model simulations and detailed socioeconomic futures, carbon cycle uncertainty as represented by diverse, process-resolving Earth System Models (ESMs) is not manifested in the scenario outcomes, thus omitting a dominant source of uncertainty in meeting the Paris Agreement. Mitigation policy is defined in terms of human activity (including emissions), with strategies varying in their timing of net-zero emissions, the balance of mitigation effort between 40 short-lived and long-lived climate forcers, their reliance on land use strategy and the extent and timing of carbon removals. To 2 explore the response to these drivers, ESMs need to explicitly represent complete cycles of major GHGs, including natural processes and anthropogenic influences. Carbon removal and sequestration strategies, which rely on proposed human management of natural systems, are currently represented upstream of ESMs in an idealized fashion during scenario development. However, proper accounting of the coupled system impacts of and feedback on such interventions requires 45 explicit process representation in ESMs to build self-consistent physical representations of their potential effectiveness and risks under climate change. We propose that CMIP7 efforts prioritize simulations driven by CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use, projected deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies, as well as land use and management, using the process resolution allowed by state-of-the-art ESMs to resolve carbon-climate feedbacks. Post-CMIP7 ambitions should aim to incorporate modeling of non-CO2 GHGs (in particular sources and sinks of methane) and process-based representation of 50 carbon removal options. Such experiments would allow resources to be allocated to policy-relevant climate projections and better real-time information related to the detectability and verification of emissions reductions and their relationship to expected near-term climate impacts. Such efforts will provide information on the range of possible future climate states including Earth system processes and feedbacks which are increasingly well-represented in ESMs, thus forming a critical and complementary pillar underpinning proposed km-scale climate modeling activities and calls to better utilize novel machine 55 learning approaches.},

   abstract = {<p>Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based fCO2 products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. Additional lines of evidence on land and ocean sinks are provided by atmospheric inversions, atmospheric oxygen measurements, and Earth system models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and incomplete understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the year 2022, EFOS increased by 0.9 % relative to 2021, with fossil emissions at 9.9±0.5 Gt C yr−1 (10.2±0.5 Gt C yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is not included), and ELUC was 1.2±0.7 Gt C yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission (including the cement carbonation sink) of 11.1±0.8 Gt C yr−1 (40.7±3.2 Gt CO2 yr−1). Also, for 2022, GATM was 4.6±0.2 Gt C yr−1 (2.18±0.1 ppm yr−1; ppm denotes parts per million), SOCEAN was 2.8±0.4 Gt C yr−1, and SLAND was 3.8±0.8 Gt C yr−1, with a BIM of −0.1 Gt C yr−1 (i.e. total estimated sources marginally too low or sinks marginally too high). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2022 reached 417.1±0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2023 suggest an increase in EFOS relative to 2022 of +1.1 % (0.0 % to 2.1 %) globally and atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 419.3 ppm, 51 % above the pre-industrial level (around 278 ppm in 1750). Overall, the mean of and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2022, with a near-zero overall budget imbalance, although discrepancies of up to around 1 Gt C yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows the following: (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living-data update documents changes in methods and data sets applied to this most recent global carbon budget as well as evolving community understanding of the global carbon cycle.

Indeed, bottom-up estimates for natural sources such as natural wetlands, other inland water systems, and geological sources are higher than top-down estimates. The atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget suggest that at least some of these bottom-up emissions are overestimated. The latitudinal distribution of atmospheric observation-based emissions indicates a predominance of tropical emissions (<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">ĝ1/4</span>&thinsp;65&thinsp;% of the global budget, <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">&lt;</span>&thinsp;30<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">ĝ </span>&thinsp;N) compared to mid-latitudes (<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">ĝ1/4</span>&thinsp;30&thinsp;%, 30-60<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">ĝ </span>&thinsp;N) and high northern latitudes (<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">ĝ1/4</span>&thinsp;4&thinsp;%, 60-90<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">ĝ </span>&thinsp;N). The most important source of uncertainty in the methane budget is attributable to natural emissions, especially those from wetlands and other inland waters.</p> <p>Some of our global source estimates are smaller than those in previously published budgets (Saunois et al., 2016; Kirschke et al., 2013). In particular wetland emissions are about 35&thinsp;Tg&thinsp;<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">CH4</span>&thinsp;yr<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">-1</span> lower due to improved partition wetlands and other inland waters.

However, the overall discrepancy between bottom-up and top-down estimates has been reduced by only 5&thinsp;% compared to Saunois et al. (2016), due to a higher estimate of emissions from inland waters, highlighting the need for more detailed research on emissions factors. Priorities for improving the methane budget include (i) a global, high-resolution map of water-saturated soils and inundated areas emitting methane based on a robust classification of different types of emitting habitats; (ii) further development of process-based models for inland-water emissions; (iii) intensification of methane observations at local scales (e.g., FLUXNET-<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">CH4</span> measurements) and urban-scale monitoring to constrain bottom-up land surface models, and at regional scales (surface networks and satellites) to constrain atmospheric inversions; (iv) improvements of transport models and the representation of photochemical sinks in top-down inversions; and (v) development of a 3D variational inversion system using isotopic and/or co-emitted species such as ethane to improve source partitioning.</p> <p>The data presented here can be downloaded from <a hrefCombining double low line"https://doi.org/10.18160/GCP-CH4-2019">https://doi.org/10.18160/GCP-CH4-2019</a> (Saunois et al., 2020) and from the Global Carbon Project.},

Models are compared to observations based on both the change in GMST over time and the change in GMST over the change in external forcing. The latter approach accounts for mismatches in model forcings, a potential source of error in model projections independent of the accuracy of model physics. We find that climate models published over the past five decades were skillful in predicting subsequent GMST changes, with most models examined showing warming consistent with observations, particularly when mismatches between model-projected and observationally estimated forcings were taken into account.},

These features favor the application of observationally constrained climate projections. The 1970–2014 trend in global mean temperature is well-correlated with projected future warming across the CMIP6 multimodel ensemble. We first evaluate an approach that weights simulations based on the realism and degree of independence of their 1970–2014 trends, by treating each historical simulation in turn as pseudo-observations, and using the other models and weighting method to predict 21st century warming in the model concerned. The method performs well based on correlation and probabilistic measures. Applying the method using the observed 1970–2014 warming trend results in only small changes in the mean and lower bound of CMIP6 projected warming but substantially reduces the upper bound of projected early-, mid- and late-21st century warming under all SSP scenarios.},

Given that further warming in coming decades could threaten increasing risks of climatic disruption, it is important to determine whether model projections are consistent with temperature changes already observed. This can be achieved by quantifying the extent to which increases in well mixed greenhouse gases and changes in other anthropogenic and natural forcings have already altered temperature patterns around the globe. Here, for the first time, we combine multiple climate models into a single synthesized estimate of future warming rates consistent with past temperature changes. We show that the observed evolution of near-surface temperatures appears to indicate lower ranges (5-95%) for warming (0.35-0.82 K and 0.45-0.93 K by the 2020s (2020-9) relative to 1986-2005 under the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios respectively) than the equivalent ranges projected by the CMIP5 climate models (0.48-1.00 K and 0.51-1.16 K respectively).

Cross-validation suggests that our method produces robust results and is not overconfident. We derive consistent observationally constrained estimates of attributable warming to date and warming rate, the response to a range of future scenarios, and metrics of climate sensitivity.

Conversely, using seven diverse integrated assessment models, we project global energy CO2 emissions trajectories on the basis of near-term mitigation efforts and two assumptions on how these efforts continue post-2030. Despite finding a wide range of emissions by 2050, nearly all the scenarios have median warming of less than 3 °C in 2100. However, the most optimistic scenario is still insufficient to limit global warming to 2 °C. We furthermore highlight key modelling choices inherent to projecting where emissions are headed. First, emissions are more sensitive to the choice of integrated assessment model than to the assumed mitigation effort, highlighting the importance of heterogeneous model intercomparisons. Differences across models reflect diversity in baseline assumptions and impacts of near-term mitigation efforts.

If there is a mismatch between modeled and observed climate features, should we necessarily conclude that our models are deficient? Using several illustrative examples, we emphasize that internal variability can easily lead to marked differences between the basic features of the model and observed climate, even when decades of model and observed data are available. This can appear as an apparent failure of models to capture regional trends or changes in global teleconnections, or simulation of extreme events. Despite a large body of literature on the impact of internal variability on climate, this acknowledgment has not yet penetrated many model evaluation activities, particularly for regional climate. We emphasize that using a single or small ensemble of simulations to conclude that a climate model is in error can lead to premature conclusions on model fidelity. A large ensemble of multidecadal simulations is therefore needed to properly sample internal climate variability in order to robustly identify model deficiencies and convincingly demonstrate progress between generations of climate models.},

Despite several assessments, the current knowledge on NETs is still diffuse and incomplete, but also growing fast. Here, we synthesize a comprehensive body of NETs literature, using scientometric tools and performing an in-depth assessment of the quantitative and qualitative evidence therein. We clarify the role of NETs in climate change mitigation scenarios, their ethical implications, as well as the challenges involved in bringing the various NETs to the market and scaling them up in time. There are six major findings arising from our assessment: first, keeping warming below 1.5 °C requires the large-scale deployment of NETs, but this dependency can still be kept to a minimum for the 2 °C warming limit. Second, accounting for economic and biophysical limits, we identify relevant potentials for all NETs except ocean fertilization. Third, any single NET is unlikely to sustainably achieve the large NETs deployment observed in many 1.5 °C and 2 °C mitigation scenarios. Yet, portfolios of multiple NETs, each deployed at modest scales, could be invaluable for reaching the climate goals. Fourth, a substantial gap exists between the upscaling and rapid diffusion of NETs implied in scenarios and progress in actual innovation and deployment. If NETs are required at the scales currently discussed, the resulting urgency of implementation is currently neither reflected in science nor policy. Fifth, NETs face severe barriers to implementation and are only weakly incentivized so far. Finally, we identify distinct ethical discourses relevant for NETs, but highlight the need to root them firmly in the available evidence in order to render such discussions relevant in practice.},

However, a bottom-up, systematic, reproducible, and transparent literature assessment of the different options to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is currently missing. In part 1 of this three-part review on NETs, we assemble a comprehensive set of the relevant literature so far published, focusing on seven technologies: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration. In this part, part 2 of the review, we present estimates of costs, potentials, and side-effects for these technologies, and qualify them with the authors' assessment. Part 3 reviews the innovation and scaling challenges that must be addressed to realise NETs deployment as a viable climate mitigation strategy. Based on a systematic review of the literature, our best estimates for sustainable global NET potentials in 2050 are 0.5-3.6 GtCO2 yr-1 for afforestation and reforestation, 0.5-5 GtCO2 yr-1 for BECCS, 0.5-2 GtCO2 yr-1 for biochar, 2-4 GtCO2 yr-1 for enhanced weathering, 0.5-5 GtCO2 yr-1 for DACCS, and up to 5 GtCO2 yr-1 for soil carbon sequestration. Costs vary widely across the technologies, as do their permanency and cumulative potentials beyond 2050. It is unlikely that a single NET will be able to sustainably meet the rates of carbon uptake described in integrated assessment pathways consistent with 1.5 °C of global warming.},

This reduces the associated anthropogenic radiative forcing, and hence the size of the warming. Because of the inertia and internal variability affecting the climate system and the global carbon cycle, it is unlikely that a reduction in warming would be immediately discernible. Here we use 21st century simulations from the latest ensemble of Earth System Model experiments to investigate and quantify when mitigation becomes clearly discernible. We use one of the scenarios as a reference for a strong mitigation strategy, Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and compare its outcome with either RCP4.5 or RCP8.5, both of which are less severe mitigation pathways. We analyze global mean atmospheric CO2, and changes in annually and seasonally averaged surface temperature at global and regional scales. For global mean surface temperature, the median detection time of mitigation is about 25-30 y after RCP2.6 emissions depart from the higher emission trajectories. This translates into detection of a mitigation signal by 2035 or 2045, depending on whether the comparison is with RCP8.5 or RCP4.5, respectively. The detection of climate benefits of emission mitigation occurs later at regional scales, with a median detection time between 30 and 45 y after emission paths separate. Requiring a 95% confidence level induces a delay of several decades, bringing detection time toward the end of the 21st century.},

Anthropogenic CO2 has the highest potential for a rapidly measurable influence, combined with long term benefits, but the required mitigation is very strong. Black Carbon (BC) mitigation could be rapidly discernible, but has a low net gain in the longer term. Methane mitigation combines rapid effects on surface temperature with long term effects.

Whether this would lead to identifiable near-term responses in “iconic” climate quantities of wide scientific and public interest is unclear, because the climate response would be obscured by quasi-random internal variability. I define the climate response as an increase or decrease in a linear climate trend over the period 2021–2035, compared to 2006–2020, and establish the probability of such a trend change being caused by an assumed policy shift toward emissions reductions after 2020. I quantify the irreducible uncertainty in projecting such a trend change through very large (100-member) ensembles of the state-of-the-art climate model MPI-ESM-LR. Trends in global-mean surface temperature (GMST) are higher over the period 2021–2035 than over 2006–2020 in one-third of all realizations in the mitigation scenario RCP2.6, interpreted as implementing the Paris agreement, compared to around one-half in the no-mitigation scenario RCP4.5. Mitigation is sufficient to cause a GMST trend reduction with a probability of 0.40 and necessary with a probability of 0.33. Trend increases in Arctic September sea-ice area and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation are caused by the emissions reductions with a probability of only around 0.1. By contrast, emissions reductions are necessary for a trend decrease in upper-ocean heat content with a probability of over one-half. Some iconic climate quantities might thus by year 2035 exhibit an identifiable response to a successful Paris agreement but sometimes with low probability, creating a substantial communication challenge.

   abstract = {We separate and quantify the sources of uncertainty in projections of regional (~2,500 km) precipitation changes for the twenty-first century using the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble, allowing a direct comparison with a similar analysis for regional temperature changes. For decadal means of seasonal mean precipitation, internal variability is the dominant uncertainty for predictions of the first decade everywhere, and for many regions until the third decade ahead. Model uncertainty is generally the dominant source of uncertainty for longer lead times. Scenario uncertainty is found to be small or negligible for all regions and lead times, apart from close to the poles at the end of the century. For the global mean, model uncertainty dominates at all lead times. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the precipitation projections is highest at the poles but less than 1 almost everywhere else, and is far lower than for temperature projections. In particular, the tropics have the highest S/N for temperature, but the lowest for precipitation. We also estimate a 'potential S/N' by assuming that model uncertainty could be reduced to zero, and show that, for regional precipitation, the gains in S/N are fairly modest, especially for predictions of the next few decades. This finding suggests that adaptation decisions will need to be made in the context of high uncertainty concerning regional changes in precipitation. The potential to narrow uncertainty in regional temperature projections is far greater. These conclusions on S/N are for the current generation of models; the real signal may be larger or smaller than the CMIP3 multi-model mean. Also note that the S/N for extreme precipitation, which is more relevant for many climate impacts, may be larger than for the seasonal mean precipitation considered here. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

The method is robust against the limitations of the observational record and avoids the short-comings of regional and global climate models in simulating the sensitivity of extreme precipitation to climate change. The maps of the sensitivity of extreme precipitation to climate change, on ~1.5 km × 1.5 km grids over North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, derived using the successfully trained convolutional neural network, show high spatial variability.

We define SSPs as reference pathways describing plausible alternative trends in the evolution of society and ecosystems over a century timescale, in the absence of climate change or climate policies. We introduce the concept of a space of challenges to adaptation and to mitigation that should be spanned by the SSPs, and discuss how particular trends in social, economic, and environmental development could be combined to produce such outcomes. A comparison to the narratives from the scenarios developed in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) illustrates how a starting point for developing SSPs can be defined. We suggest initial development of a set of basic SSPs that could then be extended to meet more specific purposes, and envision a process of application of basic and extended SSPs that would be iterative and potentially lead to modification of the original SSPs themselves. © The Author(s) 2013.},

We find that the large ensembles capture the trend and variability of heat extremes over the period 2006–2020 relative to the 1991–2005 climatology but overestimate the frequency at which the heat extremes occur. In future warming scenarios, heat extremes continue to increase over the next 30 years, with high amplitude records in the Northwest and Central US. After 2050, we find there is a spread in the frequency of heat extremes that is dependent on the emissions scenario, with a high emissions until mid-century followed by a high mitigation scenario showing a decrease in heat extremes by the end of the century. Although the frequency of future heat extremes is likely overestimated in the large ensembles, they are still a powerful tool for researching extreme temperatures in the climate system.},

Consequently, the research time expended by Early Career Researchers (ECRs) on data-intensive activities is displacing the time spent in fostering novel scientific ideas and expanding the frontiers of climate sciences. Here, we highlight an urgent need for a better balance between data-intensive and foundational climate science activities, more open-ended research opportunities that reinforce the scientific freedom of the ECRs, and strong coordinated action to provide infrastructure and resources to the ECRs working in under-resourced environments.},

   abstract = {The treatment of uncertainty in climate-change science is dominated by the far-reaching influence of the ‘frequentist’ tradition in statistics, which interprets uncertainty in terms of sampling statistics and emphasizes p-values and statistical significance. This is the normative standard in the journals where most climate-change science is published. Yet a sampling distribution is not always meaningful (there is only one planet Earth). Moreover, scientific statements about climate change are hypotheses, and the frequentist tradition has no way of expressing the uncertainty of a hypothesis. As a result, in climate-change science, there is generally a disconnect between physical reasoning and statistical practice. This paper explores how the frequentist statistical methods used in climate-change science can be embedded within the more general framework of probability theory, which is based on very simple logical principles. In this way, the physical reasoning represented in scientific hypotheses, which underpins climate-change science, can be brought into statistical practice in a transparent and logically rigorous way. The principles are illustrated through three examples of controversial scientific topics: the alleged global warming hiatus, Arctic-midlatitude linkages, and extreme event attribution. These examples show how the principles can be applied, in order to develop better scientific practice. “La théorie des probabilités n’est que le bon sens reduit au calcul.” (Pierre-Simon Laplace, Essai Philosophiques sur les Probabilités, 1819). “It is sometimes considered a paradox that the answer depends not only on the observations but on the question; it should be a platitude.” (Harold Jeffreys, Theory of Probability, 1st edition, 1939).},

The approach consists of two steps: 1) the isolation within a decision-tree framework of those cases for which individual surface-observed variables yield highly reliable estimates of upper-level humidity, and 2) the application of a statistical technique (Regression Estimation of Event Probabilities) to the remaining cases to derive equations yielding probabilities of occurrence of specified categories of dewpoint spread. This approach yields useful diagnostic information with a quantitative measure of reliability.

The outputs of the network represent the existence/nonexistence of damaging wind, based on ground observations.

The former set includes measures of accuracy, association, discrimination, skill, and the latter consists of reliability and refinement diagrams. Two classification schemes are also examined. It is found that a neural network with two hidden nodes outperforms a neural network with no hidden nodes when performance is gauged with any of the 14 scalar measures, except for a measure of discrimination where the results are opposite. The two classification schemes perform comparably to one another. As for the performance of the network in terms of reliability diagrams, it is shown that the process by which the outputs are converted to probabilities allows for the forecasts to be completely reliable. Refinement diagrams complete the representation of the calibration-refinement factorization of the joint distribution of forecasts and observations.},

Although these methods have become quite popular in recent years, they are not new. The use of AI methods began in the 1950s and environmental scientists were adopting them by the 1980s. Although an "AI winter"temporarily slowed the growth, a more recent resurgence has brought it back with gusto. This paper tells the story of the evolution of AI in the field through the lens of the AMS Committee on Artificial Intelligence Applications to Environmental Science. The environmental sciences possess a host of problems amenable to advancement by intelligent techniques. We review a few of the early applications along with the ML methods of the time and how their progression has impacted these sciences. While AI methods have changed from expert systems in the 1980s to neural networks and other data-driven methods, and more recently deep learning, the environmental problems tackled have remained similar. We discuss the types of applications that have shown some of the biggest advances due to AI usage and how they have evolved over the past decades, including topics in weather forecasting, probabilistic prediction, climate estimation, optimization problems, image processing, and improving forecasting models. We finish with a look at where AI as employed in environmental science appears to be headed and some thoughts on how it might be best blended with physical/dynamical modeling approaches to further advance our science.},

   abstract = {Weather forecasting is important for science and society. At present, the most accurate forecast system is the numerical weather prediction (NWP) method, which represents atmospheric states as discretized grids and numerically solves partial differential equations that describe the transition between those states1. However, this procedure is computationally expensive. Recently, artificial-intelligence-based methods2 have shown potential in accelerating weather forecasting by orders of magnitude, but the forecast accuracy is still significantly lower than that of NWP methods. Here we introduce an artificial-intelligence-based method for accurate, medium-range global weather forecasting. We show that three-dimensional deep networks equipped with Earth-specific priors are effective at dealing with complex patterns in weather data, and that a hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy reduces accumulation errors in medium-range forecasting. Trained on 39 years of global data, our program, Pangu-Weather, obtains stronger deterministic forecast results on reanalysis data in all tested variables when compared with the world’s best NWP system, the operational integrated forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)3. Our method also works well with extreme weather forecasts and ensemble forecasts. When initialized with reanalysis data, the accuracy of tracking tropical cyclones is also higher than that of ECMWF-HRES.},

Specifically, ML models have outperformed HRES in 10-day forecasts with a spatial resolution of 0.25∘. However, the challenge remains in mitigating the accumulation of forecast errors for longer effective forecasts, such as achieving comparable performance to the ECMWF ensemble in 15-day forecasts. Despite various efforts to reduce accumulation errors, such as implementing autoregressive multi-time step loss, relying on a single model has been found to be insufficient for achieving optimal performance in both short and long lead times. Therefore, we present FuXi, a cascaded ML weather forecasting system that provides 15-day global forecasts at a temporal resolution of 6 hours and a spatial resolution of 0.25∘. FuXi is developed using 39 years of the ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis dataset. The performance evaluation demonstrates that FuXi has forecast performance comparable to ECMWF ensemble mean (EM) in 15-day forecasts. FuXi surpasses the skillful forecast lead time achieved by ECMWF HRES by extending the lead time for Z500 from 9.25 to 10.5 days and for T2M from 10 to 14.5 days. Moreover, the FuXi ensemble is created by perturbing initial conditions and model parameters, enabling it to provide forecast uncertainty and demonstrating promising results when compared to the ECMWF ensemble.},

In fact, much can be learned from other domains where AI was introduced, often with the best of intentions, yet often led to unintended societal consequences, such as hard coding racial bias in the criminal justice system or increasing economic inequality through the financial system. A common misconception is that the environmental sciences are immune to such unintended consequences when AI is being used, as most data come from observations, and AI algorithms are based on mathematical formulas, which are often seen as objective. In this article, we argue the opposite can be the case. Using specific examples, we demonstrate many ways in which the use of AI can introduce similar consequences in the environmental sciences. This article will stimulate discussion and research efforts in this direction. As a community, we should avoid repeating any foreseeable mistakes made in other domains through the introduction of AI.

The journal focuses on the development and application of methods in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), data science, and statistics that are relevant to meteorology, atmospheric science, hydrology, climate science, and ocean sciences , that is, the "AMS sciences." AI and ML constitute a rapidly growing sector of the atmospheric, climate, and water-related sciences. In recent years, almost all of the AMS journals saw rapid growth in terms of publications on this topic, as have journals published by other organizations. In addition, there has been a rapid proliferation of AI conferences, including a recent focus on weather and climate applications. The AMS Scientific and Technological Activities Commission (STAC) committees, for instance, include a committee on AI for environmental science, which has been holding regular conferences at the AMS Annual Meeting for over 20 years and is now one of the largest contributors to that meeting. This rapid growth posed editorial challenges to the existing AMS journals, requiring editors with specialized knowledge across journals to meet the growing demand. Manuscript evaluation posed challenges , leading to some submissions being out of place in existing journal offerings. For instance, the existing AMS journals primarily publish applications of AI/ML and statistics, rather than the development of novel methodologies. AIES is intended to address this need and is intended as an appropriate home for submissions on novel AI/ML and statistical methods focused on AMS-related sciences as well as on the application of AI/ML and statistics. Topics for the journal include development of AI/ML, statistical, and hybrid methods and their application ; development and application of methods to further the physical understanding of Earth system processes from AI/ML models such as explainable and physics-based AI; the use of AI/ML to emulate components of numerical weather and climate models; incorporation of AI/ML into observation and remote sensing platforms; the use of AI/ML for data assimilation and uncertainty quantification; and societal applications of AI/ML for AMS disciplines, including ethical and responsible use of AI/ML and educational research on AI/ML. In addition, AIES will publish a short article type new to AMS journals: "Lessons Learned." These will be short papers focused on insights about the efficacy of AI methods that apply to and are deemed significant for an entire class of Earth system applications. Such insights could be derived from research results for which the AI methods were successful or unsuccessful, or from a meta-analysis or perspective based on existing research results. The idea for this type of submission originated from numerous discussions about the goals of AIES and how to achieve them. Multiple people in the growing AI/ML community within the Earth systems have expressed a need for this type of submission. As the community grows, new people have to relearn the same lessons, and the knowledge of what works and what does not work for AI in the Earth sciences is often handed down only through experience and discussion with more-experienced AI/ML scientists. AIES will serve as a place where a body of "lessons learned" will be compiled and available for all to draw on. In this same vein, we welcome tutorials under the regular article submissions, as long as they are novel and provide a contribution to the body of knowledge for AI in Earth sciences. The potential authors and readership for the journal will encompass a broad set of disciplines both within the existing AMS author pool and beyond it. Within AMS, AIES will enable us to concentrate existing papers, which are currently spread across the different journals. The concentration and focused editorial board of the new journal will help to set community standards for publishable AI/ML science. This new journal also offers the opportunity to draw from communities that were traditionally peripheral to AMS, such as AI researchers just beginning to publish their applied work to the AMS sciences. By developing a journal for both methods and application, the intention is to create a community of AI/ML practice for the AMS sciences. We hope that the authors and readers of AIES will become the core of that community.},

They promise to be reference models that could be used to improve computationally affordable coarse-grid global climate models across a range of climates, reducing uncertainties in regional precipitation and temperature trends. Here, machine learning of nudging tendencies as functions of column state is used to correct the physical parameterization tendencies of temperature, humidity, and optionally winds, in a real-geography coarse-grid model (FV3GFS with a 200 km grid) to be closer to those of a 40-day reference simulation using X-SHiELD, a modified version of FV3GFS with a 3 km grid. Both simulations specify the same historical sea-surface temperature fields. This methodology builds on a prior study using a global observational analysis as the reference. The coarse-grid model without machine learning corrections has too few clouds, causing too much daytime heating of land surfaces that creates excessive surface latent heat flux and rainfall. This bias is avoided by learning downwelling radiative flux from the fine-grid model. The best configuration uses learned nudging tendencies for temperature and humidity but not winds. Neural nets slightly outperform random forests. Forecasts of 850 hPa temperature gain 18 hr of skill at 3–7 days leads and time-mean precipitation patterns are improved 30% by applying the ML correction. Adding machine-learned wind tendencies improves 500 hPa height skill for the first five days of forecasts but degrades time-mean upper tropospheric temperature and zonal wind patterns thereafter.},

In particular, we demonstrate the usefulness of the RVM algorithm to reveal closed-form equations for eddy parameterizations with embedded conservation laws. When implemented in an idealized ocean model, all parameterizations improve the statistics of the coarse-resolution simulation. The CNN is more stable than the RVM such that its skill in reproducing the high-resolution simulation is higher than the other schemes; however, the RVM scheme is interpretable.

The goal of this summer school was to teach a new generation of environmental scientists how to cross disciplines and develop approaches that integrate all three disciplinary perspectives and approaches in order to solve environmental science problems. In addition to a lecture series that focused on the synthesis of AI, environmental science, and risk communication, this year’s summer school included a unique “trust-a-thon” component where participants gained hands-on experience applying both risk communication and explainable AI techniques to pretrained machine learning models. We had 677 participants from 63 countries register and attend online. Lecture topics included trust and trustworthiness (day 1), explainability and interpretability (day 2), data and workflows (day 3), and uncertainty quantification (day 4). For the trust-a-thon, we developed challenge problems for three different application domains: 1) severe storms, 2) tropical cyclones, and 3) space weather. Each domain had associated user persona to guide user-centered development.},

   abstract = {Many different emission pathways exist that are compatible with the Paris climate agreement, and many more are possible that miss that target. While some of the most complex Earth System Models have simulated a small selection of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, it is impractical to use these expensive models to fully explore the space of possibilities. Such explorations therefore mostly rely on one-dimensional impulse response models, or simple pattern scaling approaches to approximate the physical climate response to a given scenario. Here we present ClimateBench—the first benchmarking framework based on a suite of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, AerChemMIP and Detection-Attribution Model Intercomparison Project simulations performed by a full complexity Earth System Model, and a set of baseline machine learning models that emulate its response to a variety of forcers. These emulators can predict annual mean global distributions of temperature, diurnal temperature range and precipitation (including extreme precipitation) given a wide range of emissions and concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and aerosols, allowing them to efficiently probe previously unexplored scenarios. We discuss the accuracy and interpretability of these emulators and consider their robustness to physical constraints such as total energy conservation. Future opportunities incorporating such physical constraints directly in the machine learning models and using the emulators for detection and attribution studies are also discussed. This opens a wide range of opportunities to improve prediction, robustness and mathematical tractability. We hope that by laying out the principles of climate model emulation with clear examples and metrics we encourage engagement from statisticians and machine learning specialists keen to tackle this important and demanding challenge.},

   abstract = {Many research questions in Earth and environmental sciences are inherently causal, requiring robust analyses to establish whether and how changes in one variable cause changes in another. Causal inference provides the theoretical foundations to use data and qualitative domain knowledge to quantitatively answer these questions, complementing statistics and machine learning techniques. However, there is still a broad language gap between the methodological and domain science communities. In this Technical Review, we explain the use of causal inference frameworks with a focus on the challenges of time series data. Domain-adapted explanations, method guidance and practical case studies provide an accessible summary of methods for causal discovery and causal effect estimation. Examples from climate and biogeosciences illustrate typical challenges, such as contemporaneous causation, hidden confounding and non-stationarity, and some strategies to address these challenges. Integrating causal thinking into data-driven science will facilitate process understanding and more robust machine learning and statistical models for Earth and environmental sciences, enabling the tackling of many open problems with relevant environmental, economic and societal implications. Earth sciences often investigate the causal relationships between processes and events, but there is confusion about the correct use of methods to learn these relationships&nbsp;from data. This Technical Review explains the application of causal inference techniques to time series and demonstrates its use through two examples of climate and biosphere-related investigations.},

Using a simple conceptual model for the occurrence of extreme weather events, we show that if the objective is to minimize forecast error, an alternative approach wherein likelihoods of impact are continually updated as data become available is preferable. Using a simple “proof-of-concept,” we show that such an approach will, under rather general assumptions, yield more accurate forecasts. We also argue that such an approach will better serve society, in providing a more effective means to alert decision-makers to potential and unfolding harms and avoid opportunity costs.

If such a relationship is robust and understood, it may provide constrained projections for the real world. Here, models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) are used to revisit several ECs that were proposed in prior model intercomparisons with two aims: 1) to assess whether these ECs survive the partial out-of-sample test of CMIP6 and 2) to more rigorously quantify the constrained projected change than previous studies. To achieve the latter, methods are proposed whereby uncertainties can be appropriately accounted for, including the influence of internal variability, uncertainty on the linear relationship, and the uncertainty associated with model structural differences, aside from those described by the EC. Both least squares regression and a Bayesian hierarchical model are used. Three ECs are assessed: (i) the relationship between Southern Hemisphere jet latitude and projected jet shift, which is found to be a robust and quantitatively useful constraint on future projections; (ii) the relationship between stationary wave amplitude in the Pacific-North American sector and meridional wind changes over North America (with extensions to hydroclimate), which is found to be robust but improvements in the predictor in CMIP6 result in it no longer substantially constraining projected change in either circulation or hydroclimate; and (iii) the relationship between ENSO teleconnections to California and California precipitation change, which does not appear to be robust when using historical ENSO teleconnections as the predictor.},

There are numerous methods by which this translation of information can occur. For users of downscaled information, it is important to have some understanding of the properties of different methods (in terms of their capabilities and limitations to convey the change signal, as simulated by the global model), as these dictate the type of applications that the downscaled information can be used for in impact, adaptation, and vulnerability research. This article provides an appraisal of downscaling in terms of its perceived purpose and value for informing on plausible impacts due to climate change and for underpinning regional risk assessments. The concepts climate realism and physical plausibility of change are introduced to qualify the broad scale properties associated with different categories of downscaling approaches; the former concerning the skill of different approaches to represent regional climate characteristics and the latter their skill in simulating regional climate change. Aspects of change not captured by global climate models, due to resolution or regional factors, may be captured by downscaling. If these aspects are of interest, then downscaling may be useful once it has been demonstrated to add value. For cases where the broad scale change to the mean climate is of interest, or where there is no demonstrated added value from downscaling, then there is a wide range of regionalization methods that are suitable for practitioners in the impact, adaptation, and vulnerability field.},

However, the systematic biases of climate models often degrade the TDD simulations and hinder the application of dynamical downscaling in the climate-change related studies. New methods developed over past decades improve the performance of dynamical downscaling simulations. These methods can be divided into four groups: the TDD method, the pseudo global warming method, dynamical downscaling with GCM bias corrections, and dynamical downscaling with both GCM and RCM bias corrections. These dynamical downscaling methods are reviewed and compared in this paper. The merits and limitations of each dynamical downscaling method are also discussed. In addition, the challenges and potential directions in progressing dynamical downscaling methods are stated.},

However, in what way the SPV will respond to global warming is not clear, with climate models disagreeing on the sign and magnitude of projected SPV strength change. Here we address the potential role of Barents and Kara (BK) sea ice loss in this. We provide evidence for a non-linear response of the SPV to global mean temperature change, which is coincident with the time the BK seas become ice-free. Using a causal network approach, we demonstrate that climate models show some partial support for the previously proposed link between low BK sea ice in autumn and a weakened winter SPV but that this effect is plausibly very small relative to internal variability. Yet, given the expected dramatic decrease in sea ice in the future, even a small causal effect can explain all of the projected ensemble-mean SPV weakening, approximately one-half of the ensemble spread in the middle of the 21st century, and one-third of the spread at the end of the century. Finally, we note that most models have unrealistic amounts of BK sea ice, meaning that their SPV response to ice loss is unrealistic. Bias adjusting for this effect leads to pronounced differences in SPV response of individual models at both ends of the spectrum but has no strong consequences for the overall ensemble mean and spread. Overall, our results indicate the importance of exploring all plausible implications of a changing Arctic for regional climate risk assessments.},

Specifically, we train an artificial neural network (ANN) on seasonally averaged temperatures across the CONUS and then task the ANN to output the year associated with an individual map. In order to correctly identify the year, the ANN must therefore learn time‐evolving patterns of climate change amidst the noise of internal climate variability. The ANNs are first trained and tested on data from large ensembles and then evaluated using observations from a station‐based data set. To understand how the ANN is making its predictions, we leverage a collection of ad hoc feature attribution methods from explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). We find that anthropogenic signals in seasonal mean minimum temperature have emerged by the early 2000s for the CONUS, which occurred earliest in the Eastern United States. While our observational timing of emergence estimates are not as sensitive to the spatial resolution of the training data, we find a notable improvement in ANN skill using a higher resolution climate model, especially for its early twentieth century predictions. Composites of XAI maps reveal that this improvement is linked to temperatures around higher topography. We find that increases in spatial resolution of the ANN training data may yield benefits for machine learning applications in climate science.},

We find that in models with larger AMOC decline, there is a minimum warming in the North Atlantic, a southward displacement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone, and a poleward shift of the mid-latitude jet. The changes in the models with smaller AMOC decline are drastically different: there is a relatively larger warming in the North Atlantic, the precipitation response exhibits a wet-get-wetter, dry-get-drier pattern, and there are smaller displacements of the mid-latitude jet. Our study indicates that the AMOC is a major source of inter-model uncertainty, and continued observational efforts are needed to constrain the AMOC response in future climate change.},

Observations and model results constrain the future warming hole intensity in terms of its relationship with the present-day surface density in the subpolar North Atlantic. Models with a low present-day surface density tend to project a weaker warming hole intensity (i.e., a stronger temperature increase) due to a suppressed oceanic deep convection in the future than models with a high surface density. This relationship was robust across all scenarios and was used to reduce the uncertainty of the future warming hole intensity by 39% in the high emissions scenario.},

There is strong observational and modeling evidence that multidecadal AMOC variability is a crucial driver of the observed AMV and associated climate impacts and an important source of enhanced decadal predictability and prediction skill. The AMOC-AMV linkage is consistent with observed key elements of AMV. Furthermore, this synthesis also points to a leading role of the AMOC in a range of AMV-related climate phenomena having enormous societal and economic implications, for example, Intertropical Convergence Zone shifts; Sahel and Indian monsoons; Atlantic hurricanes; El Niño–Southern Oscillation; Pacific Decadal Variability; North Atlantic Oscillation; climate over Europe, North America, and Asia; Arctic sea ice and surface air temperature; and hemispheric-scale surface temperature. Paleoclimate evidence indicates that a similar linkage between multidecadal AMOC variability and AMV and many associated climate impacts may also have existed in the preindustrial era, that AMV has enhanced multidecadal power significantly above a red noise background, and that AMV is not primarily driven by external forcing. The role of the AMOC in AMV and associated climate impacts has been underestimated in most state-of-the-art climate models, posing significant challenges but also great opportunities for substantial future improvements in understanding and predicting AMV and associated climate impacts.},

However, using an ensemble of the Community Earth System Model coupled to a slab ocean model simulation, we show the atmosphere alone can account for ∼50% of the observed cooling trend in the subpolar North Atlantic and ∼90% of the cooling relative to the temperature change of the global ocean. We find this cooling is caused by increased local westerlies in response to external forcing that enhance heat loss from the ocean through turbulent heat fluxes. This cooling is partly compensated by the damping in SST and the warming due to the rise of greenhouse gases. We further suggest that wind-driven ocean processes can enhance the cooling in the real world, but that nonetheless the ultimate driver resides in the atmosphere.},

Despite their prominence in the climate mitigation literature, the implications of an overshoot for local climate impacts is still understudied. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of implications of an overshoot for regional temperature and precipitation changes as well as climate extremes indices. Based on a multi-model comparison from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project we find that temperature changes are largely reversible in many regions, but also report significant land–ocean and latitudinal differences after an overshoot. For precipitation, the emerging picture is less clear. In many regions the drying or wetting trend is continued throughout the overshoot irrespective of a change in the global mean temperature trend with resulting consequences for extreme precipitation. Taken together, our results indicate that even under a reversal of global mean temperature increase, regional climate changes may only be partially reversed in the decades after peak warming. We thus provide further evidence that overshooting of a warming level implies considerable risks on the regional level.},

events has emerged as a growing field of research with an increasing body of literature. This paper overviews the
methods for extreme event attribution (EEA) and discusses the new insights that EEA provides for infrastructure
adaptation. We found that EEA can inform stakeholders about current climate risk, support vulnerability-based
and hazard-based adaptations, assist in the development of cost-effective adaptation strategies, and enhance
justice and equity in the allocation of adaptation resources. As engineering practice shifts from a retrospective
approach to a proactive, forward-looking risk management strategy, EEA can be used together with climate
projections to enhance the comprehensiveness of decision making, including planning and preparing for unprecedented extreme events. Additionally, attribution assessment can be more useful for adaptation planning
when the exposure and vulnerability of communities to past events are analyzed, and future changes in the
probability of extreme events are evaluated. Given large uncertainties inherent in event attribution and climate
projections, future research should examine the sensitivity of engineering design to climate model uncertainties,
and adapt engineering practice, including building codes, to uncertain future conditions. While this study focuses
on adaptation planning, EEA can also be a useful tool for informing and enhancing decisions related to climate

In response to the challenge of explaining a model’s prediction, a vast array of explanation methods have been proposed. Despite increasing use, it is unclear if they are effective. To start, we categorize bugs, based on their source, into: data, model, and test-time contamination bugs. For several explanation methods, we assess their ability to: detect spurious correlation artifacts (data contamination), diagnose mislabeled training examples (data contamination), differentiate between a (partially) re-initialized model and a trained one (model contamination), and detect out-of-distribution inputs (test-time contamination). We find that the methods tested are able to diagnose a spurious background bug, but not conclusively identify mislabeled training examples. In addition, a class of methods, that modify the back-propagation algorithm are invariant to the higher layer parameters of a deep network; hence, ineffective for diagnosing model contamination. We complement our analysis with a human subject study, and find that subjects fail to identify defective models using attributions, but instead rely, primarily, on model predictions. Taken together, our results provide guidance for practitioners and researchers turning to explanations as tools for model debugging.},

Here we introduce a machine learning approach for linking patterns of climate change with radiative forcing scenarios and use an attribution method to understand how these linkages are made. We train a neural network using output from the SPEAR Large Ensemble to classify whether temperature or precipitation maps are most likely to originate from one of several potential radiative forcing scenarios.

We find that future SST pattern uncertainty has a significant impact on projections, such as increasing total model uncertainty by 40% in a high-emissions scenario by 2085. A reversal of the current cooling trend in the East Pacific over the next few decades could lead to a period of global-mean warming with a 60% higher rate than currently projected. SST pattern uncertainty works through a destabilization of the shortwave cloud feedback to affect temperature projections. It is critical for climate change impact, adaptation, and mitigation assessments to incorporate this previously unaccounted for uncertainty until we trust the evolution of SST patterns in AOGCMs.},

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

GCMs produce enhanced warming in the eastern Equatorial Pacific (EPAC) and Southern Ocean (SO) warming, while observations show intensified warming in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) and slight cooling in the eastern EPAC and SO. Using Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s latest higher resolution atmospheric model and coupled prediction system, we show the model biases in SST trend pattern have profound implications for near-term projections of high-impact storm statistics, including the frequency of atmospheric rivers (AR), tropical storms (TS) and mesoscale convection systems (MCS), as well as for hydrological and climate sensitivity. If the future SST warming pattern continues to resemble the observed pattern from the past few decades rather than the GCM simulated/predicted patterns, our results suggest (1) a drastically different future projection of high-impact storms and their associated hydroclimate changes, especially over the Western Hemisphere, (2) a stronger global hydrological sensitivity, and (3) substantially less global warming due to stronger negative feedback and lower climate sensitivity. The roles of SST trend patterns over the EPAC, IPWP, SO, and the North Atlantic tropical cyclone Main Development Region (AMDR) are isolated, quantified, and used to understand the simulated differences. Specifically, SST trend patterns in the EPAC and AMDR are crucial for modeled differences in AR and MCS frequency, while those in the IPWP and AMDR are essential for differences in TS frequency over the North Atlantic.},

   abstract = {Radiative feedbacks depend on the spatial patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) and thus can change over time as SST patterns evolve—the so-called pattern effect. This study investigates intermodel differences in the magnitude of the pattern effect and how these differences contribute to the spread in effective equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) within CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. Effective ECS in CMIP5 estimated from 150-yr-long abrupt43CO2 simulations is on average 10% higher than that estimated from the early portion (first 50 years) of those simulations, which serves as an analog for historical warming; this difference is reduced to 7% on average in CMIP6. The (negative) net radiative feedback weakens over the course of the abrupt43CO2 simulations in the vast majority of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, but this weakening is less dramatic on average in CMIP6. For both ensembles, the total variance in the effective ECS is found to be dominated by the spread in radiative response on fast time scales, rather than the spread in feedback changes. Using Green’s functions derived from two AGCMs shows that the spread in feedbacks on fast time scales may be primarily due to differences in atmospheric model physics, whereas the spread in feedback evolution is primarily governed by differences in SST patterns. Intermodel spread in feedback evolution is well explained by differences in the relative warming in the west Pacific warm-pool regions for the CMIP5 models, but this relation fails to explain differences across the CMIP6 models, suggesting that a stronger sensitivity of extratropical clouds to surface warming may also contribute to feedback changes in CMIP6.},

Here we apply warming patch experiments to a climate model to demonstrate that the spatial pattern of sea surface warming can explain a wide range of η . Warming in tropical strongly ascending regions produces η values even larger than suggested by the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship (7% K−1), as the warming and moisture increases can propagate vertically and be transported globally through atmospheric dynamics. Differences in warming patterns are as important as different treatments of atmospheric physics in determining the spread of η in climate models. By accounting for the pattern effect, the global-mean precipitation over the past decades can be well reconstructed in terms of both magnitude and variability, indicating the vital role of the pattern effect in estimating future intensification of the hydrological cycle.},

   abstract = {Human influence has been robustly detected throughout many parts of the climate system. Pattern-based methods have been used extensively to estimate the strength of model-predicted “fingerprints,” both human and natural, in observational data. However, individual studies using different analysis methods and time periods yield inconsistent estimates of the magnitude of the influence of anthropogenic aerosols, depending on whether they examined the troposphere, surface, or ocean. Reducing the uncertainty of the impact of aerosols on the climate system is crucial for understanding past climate change and obtaining more reliable estimates of climate sensitivity. To reconcile divergent estimates of aerosol effects obtained in previous studies, we apply the same regression-based detection and attribution method to three different variables: mid-to-upper-tropospheric temperature, surface temperature, and ocean heat content. We find that quantitative estimates of human influence in observations are consistent across these three independently monitored components of the climate system. Combining the troposphere, surface, and ocean data into a single multivariate fingerprint results in a small (;10%) reduction of uncertainty of the magnitude of the greenhouse gas fingerprint, but a large (;40%) reduction for the anthropogenic aerosol fingerprint. This reduction in uncertainty results in a substantially earlier time of detection of the multivariate aerosol fingerprint when compared to aerosol fingerprint detection time in each of the three individual variables. Our results highlight the benefits of analyzing data across the troposphere, surface, and ocean in detection and attribution studies, and motivate future work to further constrain uncertainties in aerosol effects on climate. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Fingerprints of human influence have been detected separately across the troposphere, surface, and ocean. Previous studies examining the different parts of the climate system are difficult to compare quantitatively, however, because they use different methods and cover differ timespans. Here we find consistent estimates of the human influence on the troposphere, surface, and ocean over recent decades when the same fingerprint method and analysis period is used. When we combine the three variables into a single fingerprint, the uncertainty of the influence of anthropogenic aerosols is substantially reduced and the signal is detectable considerably earlier in the observational record. Our results highlight the benefits of performing analysis across different variables instead of focusing on one variable only.},

Stratospheric cooling has also been confirmed in the mid to upper stratosphere, a layer extending from roughly 25 to 50km above the Earth's surface (S25-50). To date, however, S25-50 temperatures have not been used in patternbased attribution studies of anthropogenic climate change. Here, we perform such a "fingerprint"study with satellite-derived patterns of temperature change that extend from the lower troposphere to the upper stratosphere. Including S25-50 information increases signal-to-noise ratios by a factor of five, markedly enhancing fingerprint detectability. Key features of this global-scale human fingerprint include stratospheric cooling and tropospheric warming at all latitudes, with stratospheric cooling amplifying with height. In contrast, the dominant modes of internal variability in S25-50 have smaller-scale temperature changes and lack uniform sign. These pronounced spatial differences between S25-50 signal and noise patterns are accompanied by large cooling of S25-50 (1 to 2 °C over 1986 to 2022) and low S25-50 noise levels. Our results explain why extending "vertical fingerprinting"to the mid to upper stratosphere yields incontrovertible evidence of human effects on the thermal structure of Earth's atmosphere.},

Similar long- and short-term temperature signals occur in model simulations driven by human-caused changes in atmospheric composition and natural variations in volcanic aerosols. Most previous comparisons of modeled and observed atmospheric temperature changes have used results from individual models and individual observational records. In contrast, we rely on a large multimodel archive and multiple observational datasets. We show that a human-caused latitude/altitude pattern of atmospheric temperature change can be identified with high statistical confidence in satellite data. Results are robust to current uncertainties in models and observations. Virtually all previous research in this area has attempted to discriminate an anthropogenic signal from internal variability. Here, we present evidence that a human-caused signal can also be identified relative to the larger "total" natural variability arising from sources internal to the climate system, solar irradiance changes, and volcanic forcing. Consistent signal identification occurs because both internal and total natural variability (as simulated by state-of-the-art models) cannot produce sustained global-scale tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling.

US policymakers likewise argue it is prudent to wait and see whether climate change will cause substantial economic harm before undertaking policies to reduce emissions. Such wait-and-see policies erroneously presume climate change can be reversed quickly should harm become evident, underestimating substantial delays in the climate's response to anthropogenic forcing. We report experiments with highly educated adults - graduate students at MIT - showing widespread misunderstanding of the fundamental stock and flow relationships, including mass balance principles, that lead to long response delays. GHG emissions are now about twice the rate of GHG removal from the atmosphere. GHG concentrations will therefore continue to rise even if emissions fall, stabilizing only when emissions equal removal. In contrast, most subjects believe atmospheric GHG concentrations can be stabilized while emissions into the atmosphere continuously exceed the removal of GHGs from it. These beliefs - analogous to arguing a bathtub filled faster than it drains will never overflow - support wait-and-see policies but violate conservation of matter. Low public support for mitigation policies may arise from misconceptions of climate dynamics rather than high discount rates or uncertainty about the impact of climate change. Implications for education and communication between scientists and nonscientists (the public and policymakers) are discussed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Our review supports a constructivist account of human judgment. Public understanding is affected by the inherent difficulty of understanding climate change, the mismatch between people's usual modes of understanding and the task, and, particularly in the United States, a continuing societal struggle to shape the frames and mental models people use to understand the phenomena.

Methods: We use data from the 2009 Pew General Public Science Survey, along with data on long- and short-term patterns of temperature and precipitation in individuals’ home communities. Results: We find that long-term trends in summer temperatures influence perceptions of global warming. Individuals who reside in communities with long-term warming of summer temperatures that are coupled with long-term cooling of spring temperatures are significantly more likely to perceive that global warming exists and is due to human activity. We also find that Americans' attitudes toward scientists and science, political dispositions, evangelical religious affiliation, education, and some demographic attributes all have discernible effects on their perceptions of anthropogenic (man-made) global warming. Conclusion: Individuals’ attitudes toward global warming are influenced by long-term temperature trends in their home communities, as well as a variety of attitudinal and demographic attributes.},

Climate change scenarios have addressed this demand by providing scientific insights on the possible pathways ahead to limit warming in line with the Paris climate goal.

Growing interest across the scientific community in these areas has motivated coordination between the physical and computer science disciplines to further advance the state of the science and tackle pressing challenges. During a recently held workshop that had participants across academia, private industry, and research laboratories, it became clear that a comprehensive review of recent and emerging ML applications for climate variability and weather phenomena that can cause extremes was needed. This article aims to fulfill this need by discussing recent advances, challenges, and research priorities in the following topics: sources of predictability for modes of climate variability, feature detection, extreme weather and climate prediction and precursors, observation–model integration, downscaling, and bias correction. This article provides a review for domain scientists seeking to incorporate ML into their research. It also provides a review for those with some ML experience seeking to broaden their knowledge of ML applications for climate variability and weather.},

On the other hand, forced variability delineates the influence of external boundary conditions on the physical climate system. A methodology is formulated to distinguish between internal and forced variability within the surface air temperature. The noise-to-noise approach is employed for training a neural network, drawing an analogy between internal variability and image noise. A large training data set is compiled using surface air temperature data spanning from 1901 to 2020, obtained from an ensemble of Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model simulations. The neural network utilized for training is a U-Net, a widely adopted convolutional network primarily designed for image segmentation. To assess performance, comparisons are made between outputs from two single-model initial-condition large ensembles, the ensemble mean, and the U-Net's predictions. The U-Net reduces internal variability by a factor of four, although notable discrepancies are observed at the regional scale. While demonstrating effective filtering of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, the U-Net encounters challenges in capturing the changes in the North Atlantic Ocean. This methodology holds potential for extension to other physical variables, facilitating insights into the climate change triggered by external forcings over the long term.},

Increasingly complex socio‐economic systems require enhanced predictive information to support advanced practices. Such new predictive challenges drive the need to fully capitalize on ambitious scientific and technological opportunities. These include the unrealized potential for very high‐resolution modeling of global‐to‐local Earth system processes across timescales, reduction of model biases, enhanced integration of human systems and the Earth Systems, better quantification of predictability and uncertainties; expedited science‐to‐service pathways, and co‐production of actionable information with stakeholders.

This calls for an unprecedented level of coordination to capitalize on transformative opportunities, augmenting and complementing current modeling center capabilities and plans to support agency missions. Tangible outcomes include projections with horizontal spatial resolutions finer than 10 km, representing extremes and associated risks in greater detail, reduced model errors, better predictability estimates, and more customized projections to support next generation climate services.},

Applying climate model projections in engineering requires multiple stages of decisions, which can be summarized as three steps: determining the requirements for climate variables, obtaining climate projections, and postprocessing of obtained climate projections. From the review of engineering applications in which climate projections were used, some important differences were identified during these three steps of decisions. The case studies suggested that the selections of projection products and processing techniques are subject to different kinds of uncertainty and challenges and that the sequence of decisions can lead to great variations in the resulting regional climate change projections. Based on the two case studies and the review of applications and uncertainties reported in the literature, several general observations and recommendations for applying GCM projections in engineering are offered. © 2022 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.},

A novel multi-model dataset of retrospective seasonal predictions of September Arctic sea ice is created and analyzed, consisting of community contributions from 17 statistical models and 17 dynamical models. Prediction skill is compared over the period 2001–2020 for predictions of Pan-Arctic sea ice extent (SIE), regional SIE, and local sea ice concentration (SIC) initialized on June 1, July 1, August 1, and September 1. This diverse set of statistical and dynamical models can individually predict linearly detrended Pan-Arctic SIE anomalies with skill, and a multi-model median prediction has correlation coefficients of 0.79, 0.86, 0.92, and 0.99 at these respective initialization times. Regional SIE predictions have similar skill to Pan-Arctic predictions in the Alaskan and Siberian regions, whereas regional skill is lower in the Canadian, Atlantic, and Central Arctic sectors. The skill of dynamical and statistical models is generally comparable for Pan-Arctic SIE, whereas dynamical models outperform their statistical counterparts for regional and local predictions. The prediction systems are found to provide the most value added relative to basic reference forecasts in the extreme SIE years of 1996, 2007, and 2012. SIE prediction errors do not show clear trends over time, suggesting that there has been minimal change in inherent sea ice predictability over the satellite era. Overall, this study demonstrates that there are bright prospects for skillful operational predictions of September sea ice at least three months in advance.},

   abstract = {Models in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) predict sea surface temperature (SST) trends in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean which are more positive than those observed over the period 1982–2020. These trend errors are accompanied by linear trends in the squared error of SST forecasts whose sign is determined by the mean model bias (cold equatorial bias is linked to negative trends in squared error and vice versa). The reason for this behavior is that the overly positive trend reduces the bias of models that are too cold and increases the bias of models that are too warm. The excessive positive SST trends in the models are also linked with overly positive trends in tropical precipitation anomalies. Larger (smaller) SST trend errors are associated with lower (higher) skill in predicting precipitation anomalies over the central Pacific Ocean. Errors in the linear SST trend do not explain a large percentage of variability in precipitation anomaly errors, but do account for large errors in amplitude. The predictions toward a too warm and wet tropical Pacific, especially since 2000, are strongly correlated with an increase in El Niño false alarms. These results may be relevant for interpreting the behavior of uninitialized CMIP5/6 models, which project SST trends that resemble the NMME trend errors.},

The observed decrease in SWUS precipitation since the 1980s and heightened drought conditions since the 2000s have been linked to a cooling sea surface temperature (SST) trend in the Equatorial Pacific. Notably, climate models fail to reproduce these observed SST trends, and they may continue doing so in the future. Here, we assess the sensitivity of SWUS precipitation projections to future SST trends using a Green's function approach. Our findings reveal that a slight redistribution of SST leads to a wetting or drying of the SWUS. A reversal of the observed cooling trend in the Central and East Pacific over the next few decades would lead to a period of wetting in the SWUS. It is critical to consider the impact of possible SST pattern trends on SWUS precipitation trends until we fully trust SST evolution in climate models.},

   abstract = {This paper describes the recommended solar forcing dataset for CMIP6 and highlights changes with respect to CMIP5. The solar forcing is provided for radiative properties, namely total solar irradiance (TSI), solar spectral irradiance (SSI), and the F10.7 index as well as particle forcing, including geomagnetic indices Ap and Kp, and ionization rates to account for effects of solar protons, electrons, and galactic cosmic rays. This is the first time that a recommendation for solar-driven particle forcing has been provided for a CMIP exercise. The solar forcing datasets are provided at daily and monthly resolution separately for the CMIP6 preindustrial control, historical (1850-2014), and future (2015-2300) simulations. For the preindustrial control simulation, both constant and time-varying solar forcing components are provided, with the latter including variability on 11-year and shorter timescales but no long-term changes. For the future, we provide a realistic scenario of what solar behavior could be, as well as an additional extreme Maunder-minimum-like sensitivity scenario. This paper describes the forcing datasets and also provides detailed recommendations as to their implementation in current climate models. For the historical simulations, the TSI and SSI time series are defined as the average of two solar irradiance models that are adapted to CMIP6 needs: an empirical one (NRLTSI2-NRLSSI2) and a semi-empirical one (SATIRE). A new and lower TSI value is recommended: the contemporary solar-cycle average is now 1361.0 W m-2. The slight negative trend in TSI over the three most recent solar cycles in the CMIP6 dataset leads to only a small global radiative forcing of -0.04 W m-2. In the 200-400 nm wavelength range, which is important for ozone photochemistry, the CMIP6 solar forcing dataset shows a larger solar-cycle variability contribution to TSI than in CMIP5 (50 % compared to 35 %). We compare the climatic effects of the CMIP6 solar forcing dataset to its CMIP5 predecessor by using time-slice experiments of two chemistry-climate models and a reference radiative transfer model. The differences in the long-term mean SSI in the CMIP6 dataset, compared to CMIP5, impact on climatological stratospheric conditions (lower shortwave heating rates of -0.35 K day-1 at the stratopause), cooler stratospheric temperatures (-1.5 K in the upper stratosphere), lower ozone abundances in the lower stratosphere (-3 %), and higher ozone abundances (+1.5 % in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere). Between the maximum and minimum phases of the 11-year solar cycle, there is an increase in shortwave heating rates (+0.2 K day-1 at the stratopause), temperatures (∼ 1 K at the stratopause), and ozone (+2.5 % in the upper stratosphere) in the tropical upper stratosphere using the CMIP6 forcing dataset. This solar-cycle response is slightly larger, but not statistically significantly different from that for the CMIP5 forcing dataset. CMIP6 models with a well-resolved shortwave radiation scheme are encouraged to prescribe SSI changes and include solar-induced stratospheric ozone variations, in order to better represent solar climate variability compared to models that only prescribe TSI and/or exclude the solar-ozone response. We show that monthly-mean solar-induced ozone variations are implicitly included in the SPARC/CCMI CMIP6 Ozone Database for historical simulations, which is derived from transient chemistry-climate model simulations and has been developed for climate models that do not calculate ozone interactively. CMIP6 models without chemistry that perform a preindustrial control simulation with time-varying solar forcing will need to use a modified version of the SPARC/CCMI Ozone Database that includes solar variability. CMIP6 models with interactive chemistry are also encouraged to use the particle forcing datasets, which will allow the potential long-term effects of particles to be addressed for the first time. The consideration of particle forcing has been shown to significantly improve the representation of reactive nitrogen and ozone variability in the polar middle atmosphere, eventually resulting in further improvements in the representation of solar climate variability in global models.},

   abstract = {We describe the construction of a continuous 38-year record of stratospheric aerosol optical properties. The Global Space-based Stratospheric Aerosol Climatology, or GloSSAC, provided the input data to the construction of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project stratospheric aerosol forcing data set (1979-2014) and we have extended it through 2016 following an identical process. GloSSAC focuses on the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) series of instruments through mid-2005, and on the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data thereafter. We also use data from other space instruments and from ground-based, air, and balloon borne instruments to fill in key gaps in the data set. The end result is a global and gap-free data set focused on aerosol extinction coefficient at 525 and 1020 nm and other parameters on an "as available" basis. For the primary data sets, we developed a new method for filling the post-Pinatubo eruption data gap for 1991-1993 based on data from the Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer. In addition, we developed a new method for populating wintertime high latitudes during the SAGE period employing a latitude-equivalent latitude conversion process that greatly improves the depiction of aerosol at high latitudes compared to earlier similar efforts. We report data in the troposphere only when and where it is available. This is primarily during the SAGE II period except for the most enhanced part of the Pinatubo period. It is likely that the upper troposphere during Pinatubo was greatly enhanced over non-volcanic periods and that domain remains substantially under-characterized. We note that aerosol levels during the OSIRIS/CALIPSO period in the lower stratosphere at mid-and high latitudes is routinely higher than what we observed during the SAGE II period. While this period had nearly continuous low-level volcanic activity, it is possible that the enhancement in part reflects deficiencies in the data set. We also expended substantial effort to quality assess the data set and the product is by far the best we have produced.

   abstract = {<p>We provide a description and concise evaluation of the European Centre of Medium‐range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v.5 (ERA5) global reanalysis from an additional extension back to 1940 that was released in March 2023, including its timely updates to the end of 2022. The ERA5 product from 1979 to end 2020 and a preliminary back extension from 1950 to 1978 have already been described elsewhere. The new back extension that spans 1940 to 1978 represents the official release and supersedes the preliminary product. Currently, the ERA5 data record extends over more than 83 years of hourly global three‐dimensional fields for many quantities that describe the global atmosphere, land surface, and ocean waves at a horizontal resolution of about 31 km. ERA5 relies on the ingestion of sub‐daily in‐situ and satellite observations, and the number of these increases from 17,000 per day in 1940 to 25 million per day by 2022. Accordingly, the quality of the reanalysis improves throughout the period. Over the Northern Hemisphere ERA5 generally provides a reliable representation of the synoptic situation from the early 1940s and provides long‐term variability that is in line with other datasets. Over the Southern Hemisphere, however, for the early period the description of ERA5 seems mainly statistical. Furthermore, there is a small deviation in surface temperature compared with reconstructions based on monthly aggregations of observations over land before 1946. For this period, the absence of upper air temperature observations reveals a model cold bias in the lower stratosphere. For the period from 1950 to 1978, the final release described here improves on the suboptimal treatment of International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship observations in the preliminary release, with, as a result, a much more homogeneous representation of tropical cyclones over the entire ERA5 record. Longer spin‐up periods also have a beneficial impact on soil moisture.</p>},

Integrated assessment model results for 14 different emissions species and 13 emissions sectors are provided for each scenario with consistent transitions from the historical data used in CMIP6 to future trajectories using automated harmonization before being downscaled to provide higher emissions source spatial detail. We find that the scenarios span a wide range of end-of-century radiative forcing values, thus making this set of scenarios ideal for exploring a variety of warming pathways. The set of scenarios is bounded on the low end by a 1.9Wm-2 scenario, ideal for analyzing a world with end-ofcentury temperatures well below 2 °C, and on the high end by a 8.5Wm-2 scenario, resulting in an increase in warming of nearly 5 °C over pre-industrial levels. Between these two extremes, scenarios are provided such that differences between forcing outcomes provide statistically significant regional temperature outcomes to maximize their usefulness for downstream experiments within CMIP6. A wide range of scenario data products are provided for the CMIP6 scientific community including global, regional, and gridded emissions datasets.},

This study demonstrates that North American cold extremes, measured by the frequency of cold days in winter, are predictable several months in advance in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s SPEAR (Seamless system for Prediction and EArth system Research) seasonal forecast system. Three predictable components of cold extremes over the North American continent are found to be skillfully predicted on seasonal scales. One is a trend-like component, which shows a continent-wide decrease in the frequency of cold extremes and is primarily attributable to external radiative forcing. This trend-like component is predictable at least 9 months ahead. The second predictable component displays a dipole structure over North America, with negative signs in the northwest and positive signs in the southeast. This dipole component is predictable with significant correlation skill for 2 months and is a response to the central Pacific ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) as revealed from SPEAR AMIP-style simulations. The third component with the largest loadings over Canada and the northern US shows significant correlations with snow anomalies over mid-to-high latitudes of the North American continent. Predictions using only the three predictable components yield higher/comparable skill relative to the SPEAR raw forecasts.},

   abstract = {Using GFDL's new coupled model SPEAR, we have developed a decadal coupled reanalysis/initialization system (DCIS) that does not use subsurface ocean observations. In DCIS, the winds and temperature in the atmosphere, along with sea surface temperature (SST), are restored to observations. Under this approach the ocean component of the coupled model experiences a sequence of surface heat and momentum fluxes that are similar to observations. DCIS offers two initialization approaches, called A1 and A2, which differ only in the atmospheric forcing from observations. In A1, the atmospheric winds/temperature are restored toward the JRA reanalysis; in A2, surface pressure observations are assimilated in the model. Two sets of coupled reanalyses have been completed during 1961–2019 using A1 and A2, and they show very similar multi-decadal variations of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Two sets of retrospective decadal forecasts were then conducted using initial conditions from the A1 and A2 reanalyses. In comparison with previous prediction system CM2.1, SPEAR-A1/A2 shows comparable skill of predicting the North Atlantic subpolar gyre SST, which is highly correlated with initial values of AMOC at all lead years. SPEAR-A1 significantly outperforms CM2.1 in predicting multi-decadal SST trends in the Southern Ocean (SO). Both A1 and A2 have skillful prediction of Sahel precipitation and the associated ITCZ shift. The prediction skill of SST is generally lower in A2 than A1 especially over SO presumably due to the sparse surface pressure observations.},

SPEAR is an effort to develop a seamless system for prediction and research across time scales. The ensemble-based ocean data assimilation (ODA) system is updated for Modular Ocean Model Version 6 (MOM6), the ocean component of SPEAR. Ocean initial conditions for seasonal predictions, as well as an ocean state estimation, are produced by the MOM6 ODA system in coupled SPEAR models. Initial conditions of the atmosphere, land, and sea ice components for seasonal predictions are constructed through additional nudging experiments in the same coupled SPEAR models. A bias correction scheme called ocean tendency adjustment (OTA) is applied to coupled model seasonal predictions to reduce model drift. OTA applies the climatological temperature and salinity increments obtained from ODA as three-dimensional tendency terms to the MOM6 ocean component of the coupled SPEAR models. Based on preliminary retrospective seasonal forecasts, we demonstrate that OTA reduces model drift—especially sea surface temperature (SST) forecast drift—in coupled model predictions and improves seasonal prediction skill for applications such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO).},

Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical North Atlantic (TNA) basin are identified as the primary driver of this prediction skill.

The results of this study have potential applications in the development of early warning systems for HHE.},

   abstract = {In this study, we investigate whether the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) can enhance or diminish El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) temperature and precipitation teleconnections over North America using five single model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs). The use of SMILEs facilitates a statistically robust comparison of ENSO events that occur during different phases of the PDO. We find that a positive PDO enhances winter and spring El Niño temperature and precipitation teleconnections and diminishes La Niña teleconnections. A negative PDO has the opposite effect. The modulation of ENSO by the PDO is mediated by differences in the location and strength of the Aleutian Low and Pacific Jet during ENSO events under different phases of the PDO. This modulation is a simple combination of the individual effects of the PDO and ENSO over North America. Finally, we show that ENSO and the PDO can be used to evaluate the likelihood of the occurrence of temperature and precipitation anomalies in different regions, but cannot be used as a deterministic predictor of these anomalies due to the large variability between individual events.},

   abstract = {The impacts of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are expected to change under increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, but the large internal variability of ENSO and its teleconnections makes it challenging to detect such changes in a single realization of nature. In this study, we explore both the internal variability and radiatively forced changes of boreal wintertime ENSO teleconnection patterns through the analysis of 30-member initial condition ensembles of the Seamless System for Prediction and EArth System Research (SPEAR), a coupled global climate model developed by the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. We focus on the projected changes of the large-scale circulation, temperature, and precipitation patterns associated with ENSO for 1951–2100 under moderate and high emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). We determine the time of emergence of these changes from the noise of internal climate variability, by determining the time when the amplitude of the ensemble mean change in the running 30-year ENSO composites first exceeds the 1951-1980 composite anomaly amplitude by at least one ensemble standard deviation. Overall, the high internal variability of ENSO teleconnection patterns primarily limits their expected emergence to tropical and subtropical regions before 2100, where some regions experience robust changes in ENSO-related temperature, precipitation, and 500 hPa geopotential height patterns by the middle of the twenty-first century. The earliest expected emergence generally occurs over tropical South America and Southeast Asia, indicating that an enhanced risk of ENSO-related extreme weather in that region could be detected within the next few decades. For signals that are expected to emerge after 2050, both internal climate variability and scenario uncertainty contribute similarly to a time of emergence uncertainty on the order of a few decades. We further explore the diversity of ENSO teleconnections within the SPEAR large ensemble during the historical period, and demonstrate that historical relationships between tropical sea surface temperatures and ENSO teleconnections are skillful predictors of projected changes in the Northern Hemisphere El Niño 500 hPa geopotential height pattern.},

Sensible heat transport by watermass is accounted throughout for a complete energy balance. Carbon and vegetation dynamics and biophysics are represented as in LM3V. In numerical experiments, LM3 avoids some of the limitations of the LaD model and provides qualitatively (though not always quantitatively) reasonable estimates, from a global perspective, of observed spatial and/or temporal variations of vegetation density, albedo, streamflow, water-table depth, permafrost, and lake levels. Amplitude and phase of annual cycle of total water storage are simulated well. Realism of modeled lake levels varies widely. The water table tends to be consistently too shallow in humid regions. Biophysical properties have an artificial stepwise spatial structure, and equilibrium vegetation is sensitive to initial conditions. Explicit resolution of thick (>100m) unsaturated zones and permafrost is possible, but only at the cost of long (≫300 yr) model spinup times.},

We apply this technique to one recent extreme heat event (southcentral North America 2023) and several historical events that have been previously analyzed using established attribution methods. We estimate that temperatures during the southcentral North America event were 1.18° to 1.42°C warmer because of global warming and that similar events will occur 0.14 to 0.60 times per year at 2.0°C above preindustrial levels of GMT. Additionally, we find that the learned relationships between daily temperature and GMT are influenced by the seasonality of the forced temperature response and the daily meteorological conditions. Our results broadly agree with other attribution techniques, suggesting that machine learning can be used to perform rapid, low-cost attribution of extreme events.</p>},

Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are thought to affect the zonal-mean distribution of precipitation through two basic mechanisms. First, increasing temperatures will lead to an intensification of the hydrological cycle (" thermodynamic" changes). Second, changes in atmospheric circulation patterns will lead to poleward displacement of the storm tracks and subtropical dry zones and to a widening of the tropical belt ("dynamic" changes). We demonstrate that both these changes are occurring simultaneously in global precipitation, that this behavior cannot be explained by internal variability alone, and that external influences are responsible for the observed precipitation changes. Whereas existing model experiments are not of sufficient length to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic forcing terms at the 95% confidence level, we present evidence that the observed trends result from human activities.},

Here we describe the model components and changes to the previous version, ACCESS-ESM1.

The long spin-up, negligible drift in temperature and small pre-industrial net carbon fluxes (0.02 and 0.08 PgC year-1 for land and ocean respectively) highlight the suitability of ACCESS-ESM1.5 to explore modes of variability in the climate system and coupling to the carbon cycle. The physical climate and carbon cycle for the present day have been evaluated using the CMIP6 historical simulation by comparing against observations and ACCESS-ESM1. Although there is generally little change in the climate simulation from the earlier model, many aspects of the carbon simulation are improved.

Here, we present the CMIP6 version of the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE CMIP6) with currently 30 realizations for the historical period and five emission scenarios. The power of MPI-GE CMIP6 goes beyond its predecessor ensemble MPI-GE by providing high-frequency output, the full range of emission scenarios including the highly policy-relevant low emission scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, and the opportunity to compare the ensemble to complementary high-resolution simulations. First, we describe MPI-GE CMIP6, evaluate it with observations and reanalyzes and compare it to MPI-GE. Then, we demonstrate with six application examples how to use the power of the ensemble to better quantify and understand present and future climate extremes, to inform about uncertainty in approaching Paris Agreement global warming limits, and to combine large ensembles and artificial intelligence. For instance, MPI-GE CMIP6 allows us to show that the recently observed Siberian and Pacific North American heatwaves would only avoid reaching 1–2 years return periods in 2071–2100 with low emission scenarios, that recently observed European precipitation extremes are captured only by complementary high-resolution simulations, and that 3-hourly output projects a decreasing activity of storms in mid-latitude oceans. Further, the ensemble is ideal for estimates of probabilities of crossing global warming limits and the irreducible uncertainty introduced by internal variability, and is sufficiently large to be used for infilling surface temperature observations with artificial intelligence.},

   abstract = {Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) has rapidly advanced in recent years, offering new opportunities to improve our understanding of the complex Earth system. IML goes beyond conventional machine learning by not only making predictions but also seeking to elucidate the reasoning behind those predictions. The combination of predictive power and enhanced transparency makes IML a promising approach for uncovering relationships in data that may be overlooked by traditional analysis. Despite its potential, the broader implications for the field have yet to be fully appreciated. Meanwhile, the rapid proliferation of IML, still in its early stages, has been accompanied by instances of careless application. In response to these challenges, this paper focuses on how IML can effectively and appropriately aid geoscientists in advancing process understanding—areas that are often underexplored in more technical discussions of IML. Specifically, we identify pragmatic application scenarios for IML in typical geoscientific studies, such as quantifying relationships in specific contexts, generating hypotheses about potential mechanisms, and evaluating process-based models. Moreover, we present a general and practical workflow for using IML to address specific research questions. In particular, we identify several critical and common pitfalls in the use of IML that can lead to misleading conclusions, and propose corresponding good practices. Our goal is to facilitate a broader, yet more careful and thoughtful integration of IML into Earth science research, positioning it as a valuable data science tool capable of enhancing our current understanding of the Earth system.},

   abstract = {Research on weather and climate extremes has become integral to climate science due to their increasing societal relevance and impacts in the context of anthropogenic climate change. In this perspective we examine recent changes and evolving paradigms in the study of extreme events, emphasizing the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of research and their societal implications. We discuss the importance of understanding the physical basis of extreme events and its linkages to climate impacts, highlighting the need for collaboration across multiple disciplines. Furthermore, we explore the challenge of big climate data analysis and the application of novel statistical methods, such as machine learning, in enhancing our understanding of extreme events. Additionally, we address the engagement with different stakeholder groups and the evolving landscape of climate services and private‐sector involvement. We conclude with reflections on the risks and opportunities for early career researchers in navigating these interdisciplinary and societal demands, stressing the importance of meaningful scientific engagement, and removing barriers to inclusivity and collaboration in climate research.},
